They are the female equivalent of Tarzan, raised in the savage jungle, embodying the Noble Savage archetype, usually with an animal companion or three.  They were skimpy bits of leather.  And I love them.  I've got my favorite, Miriam from <i>Cavewoman</i>, tattooed on my arm (the original drawing is by Frank "god of Good Girls" Cho).<br/><br/>So I'm thinking about an rpg I want to write (after I finish the three projects I have lined up already) about Jungle Queens.  And I was thinking there was no way it would work, because if you have multiple Jungle Queens that breaks the Sim, and if only one character can play the JQ then everyone else is kinda fucked.<br/><br/>I know there are systems that attempt to resolve these sort of issues.  The Buffy TVS system (which I haven't read) apparently does this, allowing both Buffy and Xander as characters, with the Xanders getting some sort of compensation for not having superpowers.<br/><br/>But I had a different idea.  Most Jungle Queen stories have the same essential plot.  A group of civilized people become stranded in a Lost World.  They are unprepared to deal with the dangers of the jungle (such as DINOSAURS).  They are rescued by the Jungle Queen, who agrees to lead them to safety.  Thus a trip is called for.  Along the way, the Jungle Queen tries to make the civilized people aware of the dangers they face, but they won't listen.  So they die.  Generally one or two members of the party befriend the Jungle Queen and she saves their bacon and keeps them alive.<br/><br/>So, here's my sketch of an idea:  A game where the players play members of the lost group of civilized folks, and must travel the length of the Jungle to Safety.  No matter how skilled they believe they are, only the Jungle Queen can save them from danger.  No-one plays the Jungle Queen, and the players must ingratiate themselves with her, or die.  When danger erupts, the character with the lowest affiliation score with the JQ must narrate how they are killed, while the other players may choose to narrate how they save themselves, or how the Jungle Girl saves them.  <br/><br/>So the real game occurs between eruptions of danger, as players attempt to get the JQ to fall in love with them, or respect them, or whatever.  Anyone have any ideas about how to make a system out of this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130691/#Comment_130691" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T18:33:00+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  6:33PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130710/#Comment_130710" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T20:23:30+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  8:23PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was something I read about somewhere else on this forum where the "gaming a narrative about a single hero" question came up.

I cannot find the thread. In any case:<br/><br/>The simplest case might be a game for 2 players. Maybe your game is a game for two? Why not be a game for two?<br/><br/>Player 1 is the hero<br/>Player 2 is everybody else<br/><br/>(You could also do something I've heard done with It Was A Mutual Decision, where "Player 1" and "Player 2" are groups of people working together to decide how to act.)<br/><br/>If you have more than 2 players, you start dividing up "everybody else."<br/><br/>Polaris uses this division:<br/><br/>One player controls the hero<br/>One player controls everything that opposes the hero<br/>One player controls friends and family of the hero and male NPCs of no particular affiliation<br/>One player controls business relations of the hero and female NPCs of no particular affiliation<br/><br/>The main job of the latter two players is to use their NPCs to make impossible demands of the hero, break the hero's heart, and generally raise the stakes and bring the emo.<br/><br/>Think about what the main forces in your game are. A game in development I've heard about occasionally here is called, I think, "High Planes Drifter": <br/><br/>One player is The Drifter<br/>One player is The Devil, controlling forces that try to make The Drifter self-destruct<br/>All the other players are The Man, controlling forces that try to make The Drifter conform to society. These players must decide as a group how the things they control will act.<br/><br/>Interesting thing here is that most conflicts are between The Devil and The Man, with The Drifter siding with one or the other. If The Drifter wants to exert his own will in a situation, he needs to buy his way into the conflict and then hope that luck goes his way.<br/><br/>I think you can see how this approach can work, and hopefully determine whether it fits with what you're wanting to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130887/#Comment_130887" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T11:09:36+00:00" title="February 27, 2008 11:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2008 11:16AM by Southpaw.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite>Please read me carefully.

I just don't buy any of it.  I find that in order to take offense, one has to make a lot of (generally completely unfounded and rationally unsupportable) assumptions about the author's motives.  It requires assuming that there is more going on that what appears on the surface, when in fact there is <i>nothing</i> going on under the surface.<br/><br/>Hot chicks in leather thongs are awesome.

And as far as trolling: weighing in with a vague, this-could-be-offensive comment adds nothing positive to the discussion and, indeed, might be seen as an attempt to derail the topic altogether.  This is where being specific helps because it demonstrates that you're interested in an exchange of ideas, not just in shutting things down.\n<blockquote>The term Jungle Queen clearly has different connotations for you and Miles than it does for me. As does the fun in the idea of a Noble Savage. As does the theme of "civilized [white] people getting lost in the deep dark jungle and are saved by a [white] woman raised by the [black, inferior] natives." Maybe that's not what Miles is going for. But there's the potential. There's the potential for some folks to go "ew!"<br/><br/>That's how Tarzan reads to some people. Ew.</blockquote>\nAnd <i>The Wind Done Gone</i> gives an <i>ew</i> to other people.  Like me.  As I said: everything can be offensive to anyone if they're so inclined to take offense.  I once played a Jungle Lord in <i>Torg</i>.  Was I being a white supremacist for doing so?<br/><br/>This is where we run into trouble when discussing the topic of "offense," because it's possible to suck every iota of fun out of something if we keep cutting down through the layers of creative development until we hit something dark at the core.  Sometimes that can be the point, but it's pretty clear Miles (and I) look at this as pure whimsy of the pulpy variety.  I've learned firsthand what happens when one person's focused on the ugly while everyone else's attention is elsewhere.<br/><br/>On that note, let's ask <i>Miles</i> what he's after in his game design.  He might not be interested in depicting dark-skinned natives at all in his setting.  Recent iterations of the "jungle girl" story -- Marvel's two recent <i>Shanna</i> miniseries, Frank Cho's <i>Jungle Girl</i> series -- have dispensed with much of that kind of thing in favor of dinosaurs and the like.

Ew.</blockquote>\nYeah, people who don't actually read the books.  (I'm fighting the temptation to go off on a rant about this critique of Tarzan I read in an English class years ago, written from a multiculturist perspective, in which the author admitted to not actually reading the books and relying mostly on second hand accounts of scenes from the films.  Let's just say I find that sort of criticism deplorable.)<br/><br/>Tarzan was not raised by natives.  He was raised by a species of highly intelligent apes similar to (but not) gorillas.  Tarzan is, of course, far from the first character with this origin.  Romulus and Remus, the men credited with founding Rome, were said to have been raised by wolves.  "Raised in the wild by animals" is an ancient trope found in the legends of every culture.  The "feral child" trope also became very popular in the early part of the 20th century, with the explosion of mass media and photography, that allowed for the sensationalization of stories of feral children, both real and hoax.  That is where Burroughs got his ideas from, the headlines of papers and mythology.   And he set the story in Africa because a) there are gorillas in Africa and b) Africa was still thought of as "that huge unexplored and untamed land over yonder."<br/><br/>Which is not to say that the Tarzan stories aren't chock full of rather blatant racism.  The African natives that live near Tarzan are, in the early stories, portrayed as cowardly, callous, cruel and ignorant.  When Burroughs moved to Hollywood, he was exposed to more cosmopolitan perspectives than those he was surrounded with in the whites-only Ohio ton he grew up in.  That's why the later books feature more heroic African characters, and tend to portray the white explorers as the cowardly, callous, cruel and ignorant ones.<br/><br/>But there's nothing inherent in the concept of the Jungle King/Queen that implies racism.  Mowgli, in Kipling's <i>The Jungle Book</i> (a major inspiration for Tarzan), is Indian.  While he is portrayed as a boy in Disney's animated The Jungle Book and most of us think of him that way, an adult Mowgli -- such as that portrayed by Jason Scott Lee in the live action The Jungle Book (1994) -- fits the Jungle King archetype perfectly.  Likewise, there's absolutely no reason why one couldn't have a African native Jungle Queen.  All she needs is a backstory that explains how she got lost in the jungle and raised by [insert animal here].<br/><br/>The idea of the Noble Savage is something altogether different.  That's a product of philosophy, strongly associated with Rousseau.  I'm sure I don't have to explain how Europeans developed the handy concept of "the savage" to justify imperialistic conquest, slavery and all that other bullshit.  The concept of the noble savage was a reaction to that, a de-legitimization of imperialism achieved by asserting the moral superiority of the "savage,"  an inversion of the moral order asserted by the conquerors.  It was an early baby step in the long and arduous (and ongoing) process of recognizing universal human equality.  But it also spawned a stock character of fiction with so many popular examples that it's never, ever going to go away.  That concept of the noble savage, while patronizing when applied to real people, does embody a set of virtues that are valuable and important (living in harmony with Nature, generosity and selflessness, innocence, honesty, natural health, disdain of luxury, moral courage, innate and untutored wisdom and intelligence) that are entirely appropriate for fictional characters, especially characters in the sort of poetic mythologies created by role-playing.<br/><br/>I seriously can't understand why someone could get offended by that, unless they were...I dunno...not <i>really</i> examining it.  In which case, their offense is not exactly sympathy inducing.

They aren't for the public.<br/><br/>On a personal note, she wrote "is potentially offensive", when she meant that she herself would be offended. I do not find it wrong to say things like this. If she was someone with no personal opinion on the matter who was worried about the whole idea that maybe, someone out there might be offended, then yeah: Busybody. But if they themselves see offense in it, and are using the terms to soften the call of "This might offend <i>me</i>", I don't see why that is a big deal. Is it being a hypocrite, or simply Not Being In-Your-Face? I see it as the latter. If she had said, "I get the lost world stuff, but the women side of things might be offensive to me".<br/><br/>Also I don't see why calling for mindfulness is wrong. You can always ignore a call for mindfulness. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MKAdams</cite><br/>And also, Andy, I know you're the moderator, but I want you to really consider what this looks like from my perspective.  From where I'm sitting, it feels like you're letting a troll derail and destroy my thread.</blockquote>\nYou derailed it yourself, when you started the long conversation in public, pulling private notes into the public, to continue the righteous parade against political correctness.<br/><br/>Here's the correct way to respond to a troll, in this place:<br/>1: Saw Nothing. Discussion as if the person never posted. Maybe whisper me if you truly find it problematic.<br/>2: Say "Thanks". Then Nothing, as if the person never posted.<br/><br/>It sounds like this issue is a hot-button issue for you (and it is for Sam, as shown in the previous thread). I can relate. But by playing "let's expose and argue with the Liberal traitor" (complete with the cute comic put-downs), you and Sam have basically cluttered your own thread responding to the allegation of offense, rather than furthering your own goal of thinking about/designing this kind of play. It wasn't your intention, most likely, but that's what happened.<br/><br/>Now, consider the thread from my perspective: You could have said (to either the first comment, or the second comment):<br/>A: Nothing.<br/>or,<br/>B: "I see"/"Thanks"/"OK", then Nothing More.<br/>...and continued your conversation about the pragmatics of this kind of play without any further bump in the road. That would have been the "20/20 hindsight Best Thing To Have Done". If you go out of your way to Prove that you're Right on the Internet, the result is never pretty.<br/><br/>You contribute cool stuff to the site otherwise, so it pains me to see this thread dragged on like this. But such is Internet Drama. Let's all get over it and move on, here or in a new thread.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131294/#Comment_131294" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:03:36+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>On a personal note, she wrote "is potentially offensive", when she meant that she herself would be offended. I do not find it wrong to say things like this. If she was someone with no personal opinion on the matter who was worried about the whole idea that maybe, someone out there might be offended, then yeah: Busybody. But if they themselves see offense in it, and are using the terms to soften the call of "This might offend<i>me</i>", I don't see why that is a big deal. Is it being a hypocrite, or simply Not Being In-Your-Face? I see it as the latter.</blockquote>\nSee, I think it's disgustingly passive-aggressive, manipulative and dishonest.  I think it's mealy-mouthed bullshit designed to allow Julia to pretend that her own personal opinion is representative of some broad group of people, when it's really <i><b>just her (ignorant, uninformed, self-righteous) opinion.</b></i>\n<blockquote>Also I don't see why calling for mindfulness is wrong. You can always ignore a call for mindfulness.</blockquote>\nBecause Andy, it's 2008.  I was born in 1976.  My entire life I have been told that I need to be mindful of the potential to offend women and minorities.  I get reminded of it every day, from every direction.  At some point, it starts to get annoying.  It starts to feel like calls for mindfulness are really just another reminder that as a white male I have to spend my every moment being sensitive to everyone, and that I will never be given the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>And you know, like a month ago my gaming group collapsed and I lost several friends because I decided to play an African character, and I forgot my miniature one week, and the DM handed me a mini of a gorilla with a sword and said "This is the closest thing I have to an African." and I fucking LOST IT on him, and was literally screaming at him for being such a fucking racist piece of crap for twenty minutes straight, and letting my friends know how incredibly disappointed in all of them I was.  None of them have talked to me since that night.  <br/><br/>And now I have to deal with you and Julia reminding me to be "mindful," like I'm some kind of fucking child, like maybe I don't already know how to be mindful, like that's not part of who I am already?  Fuck that.  FUCK THAT ENTIRELY.  I am so fucking sick and tired of this bullshit.<br/><br/>Sink the fucking thread already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131303/#Comment_131303" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:07:52+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 1:08PM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LOL.<br/><br/>But seriously, sorry it didn't work out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131411/#Comment_131411" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T16:22:42+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  4:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 4:24PM by John_Powell.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MKAdams</cite>......<br/>So the real game occurs between eruptions of danger, as players attempt to get the JQ to fall in love with them, or respect them, or whatever.

People said stuff like, "you might as well make a game about being executed by Natzis in a gas chamber."<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that part of the problem wasn't just the initial tangential comments but the responses to those comments and how it heated up as both parties went back and forth. And I don't agree with taking a private whisper public.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do agree with Sam that everything is potentially offensive. Lots of indie games from major figures in our community deal with some pretty sensitive issues. Rape, murder, partner abuse, torture, terrorism and more. I understand that some of the uses of this content is to explore it rather than to celebrate it, which makes a huge difference. But it makes me uncomfortable that if you go against a liberal perspective (and I am very, very liberal and this isn't the first time this has happened) and aren't popular, you can get derailed pretty quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131856/#Comment_131856" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T03:50:07+00:00" title="March  1, 2008  3:50AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Whenever someone says "Jungle Queen" I think of The Maxx.<img alt="alt text" src="http://www.rhiannondesign.com/images/julie1_sm.jpg"/></blockquote>\nSam Kieth could draw himself some kick-ass jungle girl, couldn't he?

I hesitate even to call it <i>liberal</i>, because liberalism means being open to and freely examining various ideas, whereas conservatism advocates rigid adherence to established principles.  Call it left-conservatism, I suppose.<br/><br/>And you're absolutely right that story games in general approach many touchy subjects.  <i>Grey Ranks</i>, anyone?  And even Julia's <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> has the potential to piss people off, though I have not gotten a copy in order to judge for myself and am unlikely to after this latest brouhaha.  The key to dealing with these subjects <i>productively</i> is to examine motives.  Since Andy brought up my old "Playing at Bigotry" post, I'll use that as an example: in an old game I used an inflammatory word that was appropriate to the time in which the game was set and the historically correct attitudes of the character I was assigned.  Why?  Because the story as established seemed set up to explore the awful tensions between slave owners in the Antebellum South and their chattel slaves, <i>not</i> because I wanted to get a rise out of anyone.  My motive was productive.  The latter motive would be decidedly the opposite.<br/><br/>A jungle girl game could (potentially) do a lot of things.  One, it could render up pulpy goodness, and who doesn't like pulpy goodness?  Second, it could allow for some thoughtful exploration of reversed gender roles.  Consider that in the archetypical jungle girl story, the men are largely helpless while it's the usually marginalized <i>woman</i> who's empowered.  Sure, some folks see the subgenre as an excuse for drawing <i>hawt chix</i>, but I would argue that they're missing the point as much as Julia does.<br/><br/>Conversely, a jungle girl game could be everything Julia thinks it would be, playing up negative assumptions about white superiority.  Somehow, though, I sincerely doubt that anyone would do this and even if they would, they're not using Story Games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131917/#Comment_131917" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T15:34:41+00:00" title="March  1, 2008  3:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam!</cite>Conversely, a jungle girl game could be everything Julia thinks it would be, playing up negative assumptions about white superiority.

And as a result...your own unnecessary overboard reaction to a perceived threat is what derailed this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo back and reread Julia's post, and then pretend Ken responded more graciously to her instead of in knee-jerk-defensive-reaction mode...and then imagine how much more productive this thread would have been afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson:  The mandate to "not be overly sensitive" works both ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
