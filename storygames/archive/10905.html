Since I am little more than a speck of dust in the roleplaying/story game world, others are more than welcome to contribute their own picks of which game they would rather play. I will give others' opinions equal weight as long as the contributor has read or played BOTH games in the match-up she is reviewing. Later rounds will require actual play, but a read-through will have to suffice for the Qualifying Round.<br/><br/>The 11 match-ups in this Qualifying Round are in two groups. <b>Category Cinderella</b> pits free versions of successful games against games in the tournament on the strength of one or two nominations but with little if any publically available playtest reports or reviews. <b>Category Close Call</b> matches up award-winning but little reviewed (and even some unplayed) games with games that have yet to receive awards but which have nonetheless impressed playtesters and reviewers.<br/><br/><b>Category Cinderella</b>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Sports:</b> Contenders vs XXXXtreme Street Luge<br/></li><li><b>Heroes:</b> Capes Lite vs Apocalypse Girl<br/></li><li><b>Morningstar:</b> The Shab-al-Hiri Roach vs Grover Cleveland<br/></li><li><b>Wooing:</b> Shooting the Moon vs Being a role-playing game on the topic of the High-Flying adventures of Beatrice Henrietta Bristol-Smythe, DBE, daring Aviatrix and accomplished Exploratrix, and her Gentleman Companion, who for a Modest Fee, accompanies Beatrice Henrietta Bristol-Smythe, DBE, when the Occasion warrants her an Escort<br/></li><li><b>Wine:</b> Bacchanal vs The Dinner Party<br/></li></ul>\n<b>Category Close Call</b>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Great Debates:</b> Sea Dracula vs Executive Decision<br/></li><li><b>Bikers &amp; Bandits:</b> Mexican Standoff vs Cutthroat<br/></li><li><b>In Five Parts:</b> Crime &amp; Punishment vs City of Brass<br/></li><li><b>Absolute Power:</b> General Mud vs Court of the Empress<br/></li><li><b>Fantasy-Inspired:</b> Archipelago vs Drowning and Falling<br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mulrah" title="mulrah"><img alt="mulrah" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mulrah">mulrah</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241968/#Comment_241968" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-14T14:25:33+00:00" title="November 14, 2009  2:25PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>My Sports Pick - Contenders</b><br/><br/>I agree with the reviewer on <a href="http://playthisthing.com/xxxxtreme-street-luge" rel="nofollow">Play This Thing</a> that the whim-inspired XXXXtreme Sports Luge might be better as an entertaining read than as a fulfilling game. I can see myself playing it once just to screw around, but ultimately the Ronnie Award-winning Contenders comes off as more interesting long-term. Compared favorably with its inspiration, My Life with Master, Contenders has impressed even those with little interest in boxing (or gladiator duels or whatever you want to use as the central form of physical showdown) with its ability to both evoke the emotional feel of Rocky-inspired fight flicks as well as the drama of climactic one-on-one fights. It might not end up as my favorite game, but I can see myself playing it for more than one session.<br/><br/>Agree or disagree?

Reading both the award-winning Shab-al-hiri Roach and Grover Cleveland got me itching to play them with my gaming group. Both are, typos aside, very clearly written and use thoughtful layouts to drive home their respective themes. They also seem to do a good job combining humor with other layers of mood, avoiding the one-dimensional goofiness of many other "humorous" games. Honestly, based on just my read-throughs of the games themselves, I'd probably play Grover Cleveland first with my gaming group because it seems slightly more accessible. However, in this case, it pays to be a favorite, as the buzz I've read about the Shab-al-hiri Roach is intriguing and makes me want to play it a little more. I'll split my vote, giving the edge to the Shab-al-hiri Roach.<br/><br/>Agree or disagree?

For some, the erotic explorations of debauchery posed by Bacchanal might be quite appealing, but I see the Dinner Party getting substantially more playing time with my gaming group. It's the first game that had me laughing out loud simply at the rules themselves, and, in stark contrast with Bacchanal, it could make an excellent entry point for non-gamers.

Unlike some of the other games I've read (e.g., Contenders), the game itself does not seem to be interesting beyond its content, so, if you have little interest in politics, you'll have little interest in the game. Moreover, the only review I found for the game seems lukewarm and even questions whether it is a role-playing game in the first place. I probably should have put this game in Category Cinderella, where it would have lost to any of the favorites.<br/><br/>I personally have little interest in playing the alternative in this match-up. Like Executive Decision, Sea Dracula seems less about role-playing <i>per se</i>, focusing instead on the ridiculous requirement that players (likely uninclined to bust a move in the first place) can win the game only through dancing. I have a feeling my gaming group will have more fun with this than I will.<br/><br/>Agree or disagree?

It occurs to me that maybe we could combine some of these shorter games that are getting rolled over in the Qualifying Round into a single combo session that goes head-to-head with other more involved games.<br/><br/>The early version Cutthroat being used in this competition retains many of the flaws that subsequent ones presumably address.

Crime and Punishment also has a strong visual element through the brainstorming and investing process, but the game on the whole is far more collaborative.

Originally intended to quickly weed out lesser games, all it's really doing is separating full session games from shorter, exercise-length games.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/01/the_court_of_th.html" rel="nofollow">Court of the Empress</a> is case in point. I read it and thought it was interesting but rather simple, primed for another 0-3 spanking. In reality, it's just a different type of game, and the designer says as much: "This game is intended as a roleplaying exercise, in the same sense that actors use acting exercises to improve their craft." With this in mind, I think I'll do a MULRAH Tournament of session-length games and set aside shorter games for a "MULRAH Mini" Tournament.<br/><br/>That said, the end is in sight for this qualifying round.

I didn't want to pick between the Shab-Al-Hiri Roach and Grover Cleveland. I loved the Dinner Party, not his game but his nomination. And I think Drowning and Falling is awesome.<br/><br/>Both Drowning and Falling and Archipelago II seem like excellent games, inspired by the fantasy genre though this is a very loose similarity. I get a clear sense from Drowning and Falling of how the game can twist standard D&amp;D-style gaming into a hilarious session, but I'm a little worried that Archipelago will be too aimless to start. I understand Archipelago's aim is to develop slowly, and I wholly intend to test it out, but it's a concern nonetheless. However, even though I prefer Drowning and Falling, Jason himself has noted that <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18983.0" rel="nofollow">it's best for a short game</a>, so I might send it to my newly developing MULRAH Mini Tournament.

I tossed in three "points" for Archipelago in the jatch-up above and moved it up in my proto-ranking for eventual tournament play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242260/#Comment_242260" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T16:34:22+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  4:34PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group really wants to play Apocalypse Girl and have for a long time, but we can't quite figure out how to make it work cleanly online.<br/>\nWe considered Capes Lite for our superheroes game but after skimming it to get the general idea, went with The Pool instead.

Does anyone want to help play through some of these games? You would probably pick a bracket of four games, play them all, and select which one goes to a "Final Four" that would, in turn, receive even more actual play to determine the final champion. Please let me know if you're interested in this!<br><br>As for seeding, I've tried to remove some of the guesswork and subjectivity by scoring each game. The score is the average of two parts the game's rating on RPG.net (5 if no score exists), one part a score from 4 to 7 based on my own opinion articulated above, and then an additional 6 for every award nomination and a 7 for every award won. Thus, Shooting the Moon gets a 6.1, the average of its 5.6 rating on RPG.net (taken twice), a 7 for my high opinion of the game, and a 6 for being a nominee for the Grog d'Or Award for Best RPG in 2007.<br/><br/>I'll hold off on presenting the scores until the tournament actually begins. If nobody volunteers to help out, the scores might be the end of it; there's no way way my group can play through all the games in any timely fashion!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
