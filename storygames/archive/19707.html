Different systems may utilize these principles at different ratios or formally distribute these elements to specific players, but these 3 things are always happening.<br/><br/><b>Creation</b><br/>Creation is about <i>determining what happens</i>.

Exploration is prominent with players who want to have a lot of agency in their actions, but don't want to determine things that their characters can't influence.

I've long found that an important axis to define for players in games I GM -- "make stuff up" games vs "just play your character" games.<br/><br/>I like the concept of participation -- the behaviors you've listed are undeniably a big part of gaming practice -- but not the term itself.  "Participation" sounds to me like "engagement with the stated activity", not "engagement with the people, beyond the stated activity".  I think "socializing" or "facilitation" or something like that would be more on-point.<br/><br/>I also wonder why you're grouping mechanics-engagement with interpersonal engagement.  In my experience, there's not a particularly strong overlap between the two (in individuals or groups), and the fact that they're both "meta-level, with a focus on the real world", while true, doesn't initially strike me as useful or significant.  Where do you envision the utility of this "Participation" category?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437665/#Comment_437665" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-23T16:07:28+00:00" title="August 23, 2014  4:07PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems legit, and potentially quite useful for design.

However, it seems to me that three is a number theories abuse a lot of. I think, like David above, that Participation can be name-changed, and also splitted in two, maybe more.<br/><br/>Also, when I play, I feel I'm constantly changing between all these sets of behaviour, specially when I am GMing. I have noted that I do not enjoy staying in one set only, and so my performance suffer (either for the lack of engage or for staying in one set, I'm not sure right now).<br/><br/>I like Creation and Exploration a lot. Maybe that's one axis, and there is another one involving whatever you miss and what you call Participation (wich, as Rickard, I believe that contains Status). That second axis may be parallel or perpendicular to the first one, and I would say it's not the latter. Or maybe there are no axis but circles that expand and constrain themselves as play progress, overlapping each other sometimes and sometimes not.<br/><br/>Sorry for the geometry analogy, but it's just how my mind works when I'm sleepy.

Like:<br/>Creator &lt;--&gt; Explorer<br/>Participant &lt;--&gt; Audience<br/><br/>Or perhaps that's a tangent.  I think the spectra implied by the original post are:<br/><br/>Re: the fiction: Creation &lt;--&gt; Exploration<br/>Re: "meta-level": Creation &lt;--&gt; "Participation"<br/><br/>I think that second spectrum is a good thing to keep an eye on re: gameplay and taste.  How much are we focused on the fiction vs how much are we focused on the non-fictional elements of play, like rules mastery or socializing?  Come to think of it, that's something I've included in my pitches too, e.g. "This game is very fiction-first, as opposed to rules-first."
