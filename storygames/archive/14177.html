Fifteen Men and Scrapbook were on my "wish I could play them" list! From the <a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/program-events/scenarios/?lang=en" rel="nofollow">descriptions</a>:<br/><br/><b>Fifteen Men</b>\n<blockquote>Each player takes on the role of a pirate, receiving a new character every time the former succumbs to the crew\u2019s continuing bloodshed. It is possible for each player to win this scenario through forging alliances, setting traps and deceiving when necessary, everything in order to make sure that the last surviving pirate is one of those that the respective player has on his secret victory cards.</blockquote>\nBloody awesome. <br/><br/><b>Scrapbook</b>\n<blockquote>Mona gazes at the blond infant in her arm. \u201dLiva\u201d, she whispers softly and pulls the cover tighter around the sleeping girl.<br/><br/>A cold creeping sensation takes hold of her heart. No not Liva. Terror strikes, and a new name springs from her lips. \u201dMalou\u201d...<br/><br/>Scrapbook is a scenario about the life of Mona in a mix of reality and fantasy. By choosing between grey or pink pages in the scrapbook the players work themselves through the dreams and  the everyday life of Mona. As players it is your joint responsibility to turn the pages and to make a coherent tale. Only one thing is certain; in the end Mona ends up in a coffee shop in Germany with a baby \u2013 but is it her own?</blockquote>\nWalking that line of determined story, but retaining player agency, and fun. (Go Eva!) <br/><br/>I hope to get to play these all someday, or hopefully get to see some of the scenarios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Niels%20Jensen" title="Niels Jensen"><img alt="Niels Jensen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Niels%20Jensen">Niels Jensen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321848/#Comment_321848" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-26T14:23:37+00:00" title="April 26, 2011  2:23PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2011 2:24PM by Niels Jensen.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fifteen Men can be found on alexandria, but so far only in a danish edition.

Or maybe he's on Iceland, since the stuff goes on inside his head, it's a little hard to tell at times. The players take turns being the hitman and everyone and everything else, through three acts. And I do mean every THING. One player will at one point get to play the bullets whizzing over the head of the hitman as he's taking cover behind the wreck of a car, at some point during the yugoslavian wars of the nineties. And the bullets get to talk to him, to threaten him or beg him to stay down. The (non-hitman) roles are arranged by theme and act, so, say, in act one, one player will get to play friendship, one will play knowledge and one will play resistance. Each includes a handful of roles, some of which are people, some of which are ...other things. And then of course there's the hitman.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrange but intense. It's very much like playing out a fragmented but deeply meaningful nightmare of a tortured soul. Very, very Fastaval. But no larp element, it's all verbal. How would you larp a bunch of bullets, or a mine lying in wait, anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children from playing field 7 is about growing up in a war zone. One of the two writers, Sally Khallash, grew up in Iran in the eighties, so it's pretty informed. It's about war, but it's not about action. It's about how life goes on, twisted but hopeful, the week after bad stuff happened. Very beautiful and moving, as well as pretty harrowing. Also occasionally quite funny. Hands down my best experience of Fastaval 2011.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn form it's a chamber larp, quite physical but the players each have one main child role and a bunch of supporting roles for the other main roles, so everyone gets to play young and old, male and female. It's not translated (yet) and it contains a slightly distressing amount of text in it's current form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20Steen" title="Simon Steen"><img alt="Simon Steen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20Steen">Simon Steen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321958/#Comment_321958" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T12:37:32+00:00" title="April 27, 2011 12:37PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for the excitement and the kind words about Fifteen Men (I\u2018m another of the writers), and it\u2019s pretty motivating to know that people would like to run our game at a con on the other side of the world; that really makes you want to get the translation done.  ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nJason, we would be really thankful for your help with the final edits/localization!

We had some very active players who continually invented new scenes and even challenged the form itself, such as when we did a switch between pink and grey about every ten seconds in one scene. Very intense, very challenging and physically demanding.<br/>\nBZ'at (gm, had an all-girl team for the first time in my life, and seeing three lovely young girls cuddling on the floor made me a happy man :-))<br/>\nP\xe5ske (Easter), (gm) Short and bitter in a very good way. Can't be played without pickled herring.<br/>\nBrabrand (gm) sort of classic investigation with a lot of elements of intrigue and internal drama. Alas, my players ignored all clues, and yet managed to focus on the investigation part to such a degree that they completely ignored the drama. Not a success, but a very good scenario.<br/>\nIkea (GM, as if one was needed) Great, hilarious, simple fun. Nothing deep, but  the running commentary was hilarious.<br/>\nSex, Drugs &amp; Rock'n'Roll (GM). Wonderful, fun and dramatic. Game ended too soon when one of my players recieved the dreaded phone call that a close relative was hospitalized.<br/>\nLeaves of destiny (player). Didn't know a thing about the game, as I was supposed to have run "The Family" but had a shortage of players. Very interesting characters, great gm with a wonderful voice. Characters were... hard to describe, really, but "bloody nasty mean people" comes to mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322088/#Comment_322088" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-28T13:06:01+00:00" title="April 28, 2011  1:06PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2011 1:06PM by L.Trenti MrVALIS.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Steen</cite>Thank you all for the excitement and the kind words about Fifteen Men (I\u2018m another of the writers), and it\u2019s pretty motivating to know that people would like to run our game at a con on the other side of the world; that really makes you want to get the translation done.  ;-)<br/></blockquote>\nI'd really like to run it on the italian seashore during <a href="http://www.mosquitogames.org/" rel="nofollow">Mosquito Games</a> mid-june, if that counts. :-)<br/>Arr!<br/><br/>Ciao<br/>Lorenzo Trenti                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20Steen" title="Simon Steen"><img alt="Simon Steen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20Steen">Simon Steen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322485/#Comment_322485" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T03:45:48+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  3:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: MrValisPosted By: Simon SteenThank you all for the excitement and the kind words about Fifteen Men (I\u2018m another of the writers), and it\u2019s pretty motivating to know that people would like to run our game at a con on the other side of the world; that really makes you want to get the translation done. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd really like to run it on the italian seashore duringMosquito Gamesmid-june, if that counts. :-)<br/>\nArr!<br/>\n<br/>\nCiao<br/>\nLorenzo Trenti<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Lorenzo.
