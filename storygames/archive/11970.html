We're just about to start our second Dogs town on Google Wave.  We've got three players, but there's room for one more.  If you're interested in joining in, come swing by the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://wave.google.com/wave/?pli=1#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252B1uPpdv5UD" rel="nofollow">Dogs co-ordination wave</a> for a look at what we do and then post in the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://wave.google.com/wave/?pli=1#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252BkB0ROLWvG" rel="nofollow">Dogs recruitment quarantine wave</a> to say hi.  (We need the separate wave to prevent spammers trashing the main wave.  Sad, but true.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're interested but lack a Wave account, I can provide an invite: whisper me the email address you want it sent to, noting that the address will end up associated with a Google account if it isn't already.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
