This year it will take place on September 22, 2012.<br/><br/>I am using Conplanner.com to organize the Con. It was created by the Fear the Boot guys to run their annual Fear the Con. It allows participants to create and join events at the con, so I think it will make it a lot easier for people to set up games. It also has RSS feeds, so you can keep abreast of any changes to activities or the Con.<br/><br/>You will have to create an account on ConPlanner. As before, Ice Station Nerdly will have two slots, afternoon and evening, but we have five potential locations for the games. (We added a screened deck to the house. Weather permitting, of course).<br/><br/>After you create an account on the site, you can join or create activities (I have created one). I will assign locations to the games (living room, dining room, basement, upstairs, deck).<br/><br/>Hopefully this will make it easier for us to set up the con. If you have any questions or problems, please contact me at jhosmer1@gmail.com<br/><br/>The Conplanner site for Ice Station Nerdly 2012 is: <a href="http://www.conplanner.com/ISN2012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.conplanner.com/ISN2012</a><br/><br/>We also have a Google Group, so if you are interested in learning more about Ice Station Nerdly, or to make sure that you get announcements about future Ice Station Nerdly events, please whisper me your e-mail address and I'll send you an invite.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387652/#Comment_387652" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T08:30:16+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  8:30AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a fantastic event!
