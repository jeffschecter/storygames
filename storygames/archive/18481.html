Deathwatch (DW) is a game where the players take the roles of gene-enhanced super warrior monks battling the enemies of mankind\u2019s fascistoid Imperium. That star spanning colossal being the last line of defense between humanity and certain extinction. Since the players take the guise of glory seeking  warrior monks coming from different chapters, a lot of internal rivalry is to be expected, and is also somewhat catered for in the rules.<br/><br/>However, I feel that the game really falls on its face when it comes to the action part. Instead of being the action filled romp it ought to be, filled with oath taking, boasting and <i>\u2018for the Emperor\u2019</i>-s it is a sluggish, book-keeping fest of future world simulation. Not at all what I had expected when I opened the book. Since having played through a small campaign which died out due to the tedium of the rules I have been searching for a game system that would allow me to play DW the way I had imagined it would be.<br/><br/>Reading on the forum that someone has started a re-skinning of the <i>\u201cThe Regiment\u201d</i>-hack I realize that AW is probably the system I have been looking for. In AW reality is brutal and unforgiving and everything is tethering on the brink of oblivion. At the same time relations between the characters are important and help drive the story forward. This coincides with how I see how DW should be. But The Regiment introduces a more fine-tuned combat system than AW, a more simulating approach if you will. That is exactly what I want away from in Deathwatch. <br/><br/>Considering that the subject matter is 7\u2019 tall super human warrior monks 38.000 years into the future simulating reality shouldn\u2019t be among the concerns of the game. Creating a fast paced action focused game where questions of valor, glory and chapter history are more important than how large the  percentile gain is of a night vision scope when firing through smoke on the other hand, should.<br/>So this leads me to using the original AW as basis for my hack. When I found Mike Sands\u2019 <i>\u201cThe Juggernaut\u201d</i> playbook I knew I had something.<br/><br/>Why I originally had not thought about doing an AW hack is that the original playbooks are very singular in how the players create their roles, whereas in DW character creation is very binary; i.e. Chapter/Class. But now I believe I have a solution. It came to me as I sat folding playerbooks for tonight\u2019s game of AW. My printer at home is unable to print both sides so I simply printed them and then folded them back to back. Holding them in my hands I realized how I could combine the cool playbooks with the binary Space Marines of the future. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I\u2019ll make one side of the playbook the class and the other side the chapter!</span><br/><br/>How I will do this is probably have the class on the outside, so it gets a cool class picture (Assault marine, Techmarine etc.), Armour/weapon page for class-appropriate weapons, and a Create class page (where you choose some specials/moves which are transferred to the inside). The inside will have the creating chapter choice page, a stats and death move (they\u2019re not supposed to have sex so they\u2019ll get cool death moves instead, I don\u2019t know who came up with the idea, but I \u2018ve seen it somewhere before) page and a moves page.<br/><br/>Given as some chapters can\u2019t choose certain classes in DW I will keep to that spirit and let the stats be dependent on chapter choice rather than class choice. As for stats I think I\u2019ll replace \u201cHot\u201d with \u201cHonor\u201d and \u201cWeird\u201d with \u201cAttuned\u201d, as in attuned to the warp (courtesy of Star Wars World's Attuned to the Warp I believe). <br/><br/>A space marine is dangerous without his armour but with it he turns into a capable killing machine. I\u2019m not sure how it should be reflected in the rules, but my first idea is that each class gets a modifier in tune with its role. I.e: Assault marine (grisly trophies) +1 hard, Tactical Marine (Glorious standard) +1 Honor, Librarian (Aegis collar) +1 Attuned etc. Each suit of armour will also have a strength and a weakness chosen from a list, much as The Juggernaut\u2019s armour.<br/><br/>\u201cExperience\u201d will be called Glory.<br/><br/><b>For the classes I only have some sketchy ideas so far:</b><br/><br/>Tactical marine is supposed to be the leader type much as in DW. I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to combine the hardholder/operator way of influencing the game by a start of the session mechanic. Or at least start of the mission mechanic where the Tac marine\u2019s moves define what kind of support their operation will get. I guess I\u2019ll have to take a closer look at The Regiment for this. Otherwise the Tactical marine is supposed to have moves centered around leadership and tactical issues.<br/><br/>Assault marine is all about aggression.<br/><br/>Techmarine will be using the savvyhead as a basis but I will try to work in the human/dehumanized dichotomy as well.<br/><br/>Devestator is all about bringing the big guns to bear. But not just massive destruction, there will be a suppressive bit too, a bit less aggressive and more tactical.<br/><br/>Apothecary is like the angel. Of death, if he has to remove the gene-seed\u2026<br/><br/>Librarian is highly attuned to the warp but I believe the use should be more offensive with a high risk/high reward component.<br/><br/>I haven\u2019t started on the chapters yet. Blood Angels, Dark Angels, Space Wolves, Ultramarines, Black Templars, and the Storm Wardens are the ones featured in the core rulebook. Imperial Fists and 15 successor chapters were featured in Rites of Battle and  Iron Hands, Salamanders, Raven Guard and White Scars were featured in First Founding .<br/><br/>I like the DW distinction of solo/squad abilities but I think I\u2019ll dumb them down.<br/><br/>Fighting hordes is easily managed by the gang-mechanic from AW.<br/><br/>I haven\u2019t started looking at basic moves yet, but one idea is exchange "Read Sitch" with some kind of Tactical Appraisal.<br/><br/>Well, this is what I\u2019ve got so far. Ideas, criticism?<br/><br/>TL;DNR:  Deathwatch rules unnecessarily complicated, AW rules fit the format, combine for the win!

I haven't had time to really read through The Regiment yet, but one aspect of it that I didn't like is that the rules for fighting is more complicated than in AW. Seeing as the overcomplication in DW is what I really disliked. <br/><br/>As Space Marines are supposed to be superhuman killing machines ordinary battles should in my view be resolved in a few dice rolls and then acted out, while the boss battles and overcoming insane odds should be the meat and potatoes of the game. Paired with camp brotherhood-affirming interaction between the players of course.<br/><br/>So while I like the new stats you have I think I\u2019ll just remake Hot into Honor and Hard into Fight and see where it gets me.<br/><br/>As for making new moves this is more like what I had in mind. I haven\u2019t got down to actually thinking about which moves there should be, but I\u2019ll gladly use the ones you provided as inspiration.<br/><br/>I have been thinking of the agenda for the MC and the principles for the game. Deathwatch is very much made to play in an old fashioned way. I think this ties in with it being an inheritor of the system of the inquisitor rpg. I.e. the GM sets up a secret that the players try to figure out. Just that in DW the secret is instead the GM sets up a mission, often with false or incomplete intel to complicate things further on, and the players try to survive and succeed at the mission.<br/><br/>This playing style could be done in AW by changing the Agenda of the MC. But I\u2019m leaning more towards some kind of session-start process of determining what kind of mission should be played and what kind of opposition will turn up. That would gear more towards AWs Play to find out what happens for both the players and the MC.<br/><br/>This stems mostly from me being sick and tired of coming up with all the stuff as GM. And that I\u2019ve found that it increases the emotional investment of the players in their characters if they get to do world building too. It also ties in with being a fan of the characters. If you are a fan, you really want to know what they\u2019re doing.<br/><br/>So nothing new from me, but I\u2019m still working on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416962/#Comment_416962" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T07:55:36+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  7:55AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually read through The Regiment 2.5 and it's a nice game. So I stole some ideas from it and here's my first rough of how the missions are made in AW/DW:<br/><br/>Session start:<br/><b>Unit leader selection</b><br/>Either the characters agree on who is unit leader or they get to roll off against each other. Roll +Honor with the character scoring the highest result being the unit leader. If you roll off take -1 to the mission aspects stage. <br/><br/>Should every character rolling for unit leadership fail (roll 6 or less) take additional -1 to the mission aspects stage for all the discord caused and roll again.<br/><br/>Naturally characters not wanting to lead can either aid or interfere with others vying for the position. If you want to aid or interfere with the unit leader selection roll +Hx: <br/><i>10+</i> you add +1 or deduct -1 from the chosen character\u2019s roll and add or deduct the same amount from the Hx with that same character. <br/><i>7-9</i> deduct -1 from the chosen character\u2019s roll and deduct the same amount from the Hx with that same character OR take -1 to the mission aspects stage, player choice.<br/><br/><b>Mission aspects</b><br/>The Unit leader rolls +Cool and subtracts eventual -1s from the unit leader selection:<br/><i>10+</i> Unit leader chooses four traits from the list, MC chooses one trait from each aspect not chosen<br/><i>7-9</i> Unit leader chooses two traits from the list, MC chooses one trait from each aspect not chosen<br/><i>6-</i> MC chooses three traits, Unit leader chooses two wants and one trait from each other aspect not chosen<br/><br/><b>Mission aspects list</b><br/><i>Mission Planet:</i> Agri World, Arid World, Dead World, Death World, Hive World, High-G World, Low-G World, Poisoned Atmosphere, Forge World, Recruiting World, Maiden World, Shrine World, Water World, Volcanic World, Space Hulk, Daemon World<br/><br/><i>Mission Want:</i> Unsupported, Bad Intel, Deadline, Bad Odds, Stealth Required, No Resupply, No Extraction Available<br/><br/><i>Mission Objective:</i> Retrieval, Penal, Reconnaissance, Hold the line, Assistance, Infiltration, Ambush<br/><br/><i>Mission Enemies: </i>Chaos Marines, Orks, Renegade Guard, Tau, Tau sympathizers, Eldar, Dark Eldar, Necrons, Tyranids, Renegade Marines, Daemons, Renegade Mechanicus.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of adding some way for the Unit leader to influence what the MC chooses but I'm not sure what the cost should be. If it should be simply added wants or the possibility for the MC to spring surprises later on. <br/><br/>There should possibly be more Mission Objectives and Wants to choose from.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking of adding Mission Surplus, but maybe that should only be activated by a tactical Marine specialty?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417002/#Comment_417002" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T15:31:11+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  3:31PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2013 3:33PM by Ironjens.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so I reworked the above bit and added deployment type, opposition and mission surprises. I think it'll work nicely to set up the mission. Now I just have to figure out some specialties for the tactical marine that will influence this setup...<br/><br/><b>Session start:</b><br/><b>Unit leader selection</b><br/>Each Deathwatch Killteam has a leader. Often this role falls to the most honored of the battle brothers but experience speaks volumes too.<br/><br/>Either the characters agree on who is unit leader or they get to roll off against each other. Roll +Honor with the character scoring the highest result being the unit leader. If you roll off take -1 to the mission aspects stage. <br/><br/>Should every character rolling for unit leadership fail (roll 6 or less) take additional -1 to the mission aspects stage for all the discord caused and roll again.<br/><br/>Naturally characters not wanting to lead can either aid or interfere with others vying for the position. If you want to aid or interfere with the unit leader selection roll +Hx: <br/><i>10+</i> you add +1 or deduct -1 from the chosen character\u2019s roll and add or deduct the same amount from the Hx with that same character. <br/><i>7-9</i> deduct -1 from the chosen character\u2019s roll and deduct the same amount from the Hx with that same character OR take -1 to the mission aspects stage, player choice.<br/><br/><b>Mission aspects</b><br/>The mission aspects define the <i>what</i>, <i>where</i> and <i>how</i>\u2019s of the mission the watch captain is about to send the heroes upon.<br/><br/>The Unit leader rolls +Cool and subtracts eventual -1s from the unit leader selection:<br/><i>10+</i> Unit leader chooses four traits from the list, MC chooses one trait from each aspect not chosen<br/><i>7-9</i> Unit leader chooses two traits from the list, MC chooses one trait from each aspect not chosen<br/><i>6-</i> MC chooses three traits, Unit leader chooses two wants and one trait from each other aspect not chosen<br/><br/><b>Mission aspects list</b><br/><i>Mission Planet:</i> Agri World, Arid World, Dead World, Daemon World, Death World, Forge World, Hive World, High-G World, Low-G World, Maiden World, Poisoned Atmosphere, Recruiting World, Shrine World, Water World, Volcanic World, Space Hulk.<br/><br/><i>Mission Objective:</i> Ambush, Assassination, Assistance, Hold the line, Infiltration, Reconnaissance, Retaliatory, Retrieval.<br/><br/><i>Mission Enemies:</i> Chaos Marines, Daemons, Dark Eldar, Eldar, Necrons, Orks, Renegade Guard, Renegade Mechanicus, Renegade Marines, Tau, Tau Sympathizers, Tyranids.<br/><br/><i>Mission Deployment:</i> Aerial (Thunderhawk), Ground (Rhino), Ground Assault (Land Raider), Instant (Teleportation), Orbital (Droppod), Other (Rock drill transport, Submarine, etc.), Stealthed (Gravchutes).<br/><br/><i>Mission Want:</i> Bad Intel, Bad Odds, Deadline, No Extraction Available, No Resupply, Stealth Required, Unstable Warp, Unsupported, Warzone.<br/><br/><b>Opposition</b><br/>The mission aspects delineate the outline of the mission while the level of opposition is a possibility for the characters to influence the mission through trade with the GM. <br/><br/>The level of opposition is a scale where \u201c<i>Normal</i>\u201d is the zero and \u201c<i>Light</i>\u201d and \u201c<i>Insane</i>\u201d are the extremes. As you can see, if translated to numbers it goes from -1 to +4:<br/><br/><i>Level of opposition:</i> <i>Light, Normal, Increased, High, Extreme, Insane</i><br/><br/>Normal is where the level of opposition starts. For each step to the right (i.e. increase in opposition) that the Unit leader moves the level of opposition one of the traits chosen by the MC on the Mission aspects list can be removed. If the trait is the only one of that aspect it can instead be changed into another of the same aspect, thereby fulfilling the requirement of there being at least one trait from each aspect.<br/><br/>For each step to the left (i.e. decrease in opposition) that the Unit leader moves the level of opposition the MC gets to choose another mission want OR a Mission Surprise (to the maximum of two Mission Surprises).<br/><br/><b>Mission Surprises</b><br/>If the Unit leader has traded for decreased opposition the MC has a choice of taking Mission Surprises. A Mission Surprise is simply a trait chosen from the Mission Aspects list which is not revealed until applicable. This Surprise may or may not override previous traits or just simply add new traits, at the MC\u2019s discretion. Up to two Mission Surprises may be chosen but they must be chosen from different aspects.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417280/#Comment_417280" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T03:04:16+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  3:04AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2013 11:40PM by Ironjens.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the stats this is my brief:<br/><b>Fight</b> (Hard) - The stat to use when engaged in fighting, be it ranged or melee.<br/><br/><b>Honor</b> (Hot) - DW has no real use of Hot, on the other hand honor, old relics and stories of former glories are the only things Space Marines respect. These are also the things they use to impress allies (Imperiel Guard et al.) and try to impress aliens with. Hence Honor.<br/><br/><b>Cool</b> - Level headed. Which comes naturally for Space Marines after decades of brainwashing and battle field experience. But some have more of it. This stat is used when reading a situation\u2019s tactical possibilities. This is also the stat used when mission planning.<br/><br/><b>Attuned</b> (Weird) \u2013 Opening your head to the warp. Anyone can do it, but only the librarian should\u2026<br/><br/><b>Technosavant</b> (Sharp-ish) \u2013 Knowledgeable of technological objects, what unguents and chants appease which machine spirits etc.<br/><br/>My reasoning behind the glaring mashup of what was cool and sharp is twofold: Firstly Space Marines are by definition not going to lose their wits and will never have to roll for doing things under fire. On the other hand some might enjoy fighting too much to take a level headed appraisal of the situation. Hence Cool is used to read a sitch. <br/><br/>Secondly Sharp is too broad to use as the Techmarine focused stat. On the other hand all stats are broad in their application, but the DW setting is a sci-fi setting steeped deep in technological superstition. It also fits very well with the Space Marine belief that to use alien technology is to promote heresy. Hence the quite narrow stat of Techsavant. The other specialties have low numbers in this stat since they have a more superstitious/disinterested relationship to their battle gear.<br/><br/>These are my general ideas for the <i>Specialties</i>. Where there is a slash in the focused stat this is to denote different ways in which the player might take the character. I'm going to have players choose from two different solo abilities and squad mode abilities (that's what the OR is for) from the specialty and from two each from the chapter choice. So each character will end up with two possible solo- and two possible squad mode abilities. We'll see how it goes.<br/><br/><b>Apothecary</b><br/>Triage, close range support and the emperor\u2019s blessing (i.e. end the suffering of compatriots) is the focus of the Apothecary.<br/>Focused stat: Cool<br/>Mechanic: Narthecium (First aid and gene seed removal)<br/>Solo ability: OR<br/>Squad Mode (if Unit Leader): OR<br/><br/>Stats (choose one column)<br/>Fight (Hard) 1/2/0<br/>Honor (Hot) 0/1/1<br/>Cool 3/2/3<br/>Attuned (Weird) 0/0/0<br/>Techsavant 1/0/1<br/><br/><b>Assault Marine</b><br/>The Assault Marine specialty brings the pure melee-centric hatred to the enemies of humankind.<br/>Focused stat: Fight<br/>Mechanic: <br/>Solo ability: OR<br/>Squad Mode (if Unit Leader): OR<br/><br/><b>Devestator</b><br/>The Devestator deals in either long range heavy destruction or tactical supression and back up.<br/>Focused stat: Fight/Cool (damage dealing/tactical suppression)<br/>Mechanic: <br/>Solo ability: OR<br/>Squad Mode (if Unit Leader): OR<br/><br/><b>Librarian</b><br/>The Librarian channels the dangerous powers of the warp to destroy enemies of humanity.<br/>Focused stat: Attuned<br/>Mechanic: <br/>Solo ability: OR<br/>Squad Mode (if Unit Leader): OR<br/><br/><b>Tactical Marine</b><br/>A jack-of-all-trades the Tactical Marine embodies the nobility of humanity's defenders.<br/>Focused stat: Honor/Cool (lead by example/strategic)<br/>Mechanic: <br/>Solo ability: OR<br/>Squad Mode (if Unit Leader): OR<br/><br/><b>Techmarine</b><br/>The Techmarine straddles the thin line between enhanced human and unhuman cyborg and is the link between the Space Marines and the tech-priests of Mars. His charge is to keep the unit's battlegear in fighting condition.<br/>Focused stat: Techsavant<br/>Mechanic: <br/>Solo ability: OR<br/>Squad Mode (if Unit Leader): OR                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417281/#Comment_417281" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T03:20:31+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  3:20AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2013 3:21AM by Ironjens.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random ideas:<br/><br/><i>Squad mode abilities</i> are powerful once-per-mission-effects that the Unit leader can employ.<br/><b>Assault Marine</b> - <i>Devestating Charge</i>.

This explains the techmarine\u2019s squad mode.<br/><br/><b>Twinlinked.</b> <br/>Don\u2019t remember if twinlinked does anything in DW but I\u2019m going with the classic re-roll.<br/><br/>And a first fleshing out of the techmarine. Do you think I missed soemthing important or messed something up?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Techmarine</b><br/>The Techmarine straddles the thin line between enhanced human and unhuman cyborg and is the link between the Space Marines and the tech-priests of Mars. His charge is to keep the unit's battlegear in fighting condition and to keep them on the good side of the machine spirits. <br/><br/>The Techmarine\u2019s signature stat is Techsavant as that is his domain. But you can also aim for Attuned if you want the mystic priesthood angle to be noticeable. The techmarine\u2019s willingness to improve in his fleshly form is also prevalent in the ability to shift stats after a stat column is chosen.<br/><br/><b>Stuff:</b><br/><b>Artificier armor:</b> Your suit of armor is a meticulous maintained relic from the priesthood of mars. It has an armor value of 4 in addition to the armor history stats.<br/><br/><b>Servo harness:</b> Your backpack is the basis of your servo harness, a bulky contraption sporting numerous arms and mecha-tendrils. It is connected directly to your black carapace but also incorporates additional cranial adaptions and splicings in your brain to be able to coordinate the many limbs. <br/><b>Strenghts</b>, Choose 4 (Choices can be multiplied twice):<br/><i>Loader arm:</i> You have an extremely strong power loader arm mounted on the harness. If chosen twice you have two loader arms.<br/><i>Plasma cutter:</i> You have an arm with a plasma cutter welding torch attached. If chosen twice the plasma cutter has an extremely large aperture and can be used as a flamer.<br/><i>Mechatendril cluster:</i> You have a cluster of mechadendrils sprouting from the harness. These include datatendrils for direct interface with imperial machine spirits and have normal reach. If chosen twice the tendrils can be used as ambulatory mode and have double the reach (i.e. given hand-holds and purchases the techmarine can climb unhindered over any surface).<br/><i>Heavy weapon mount:</i> You have a heavy weapon mounted on your harness (Either Heavy Bolter, Plasma Cannon, Lascannon, Missile Launcher). If chosen twice the weapon is twinlinked. <br/><b>Weaknesses:</b> <br/>The harness is significantly larger than a normal suit of power armor. It is: <i>Bulky</i>. <br/>The space needed inside your head for the hardware means some unimportant things have had to be removed. When dealing with normal imperial citizens you have -1 on any rolls.<br/><br/><b>Solo abilities: </b><br/><b>Battlefield Repair.</b> Your intimate relationship with the Omnissiah allows you to conduct field repairs beyond the scope of your battle brothers. When repairing something roll +Techsavant:<br/>10+ You have returned the object to working order and the Omnissiah is pleased. 7-9 You have returned the object to function but something is wrong. If you miss the object is beyond the ability to repair in the field. Given a machine temple and time it might still be salvageable. <br/><br/><i>And chose one:</i><br/><b>Machine-Spirit touched.</b> You have +1 on all rolls involving imperial vehicles but suffer -1 to your Honor stat. <br/>- OR - <br/><b>Praise the Omnissiah</b>. Whenever there is time to pause and to apply the sacred unguents and chant the praises needed to keep your wargear in top condition hold 1. You can spend your hold one for one to take +1 on a roll involving your wargear.<br/><br/><b>Squad Mode (if Unit Leader)</b><br/><i>Chose one:</i><br/> <b>Master of the Armory.</b> During the mission the weapons employed by the squad will never jam.<br/> \u2013 OR \u2013 <br/><b>Battlefield Blessed and Re-Canonized.</b> Once during a mission your unusually elastic sense of propriety allows you to convert a non-imperial technological artifact into an approved avatar of the Omnissiah.<br/><br/><b>Stats</b> (choose one column)<br/>Fight (Hard) 1/2/2<br/>Honor (Hot) 0/-1/-1<br/>Cool 2/2/2<br/>Attuned (Weird) 0/1/0<br/>Techsavant 3/2/3<br/><br/>The Techmarine can choose to adjust the chosen stat column by subtracting points from Fight or Honor (down to -1 at most) and adding these to either Cool, Attuned or Techsavant (up to a max of 3).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul.N" title="Paul.N"><img alt="Paul.N" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul.N">Paul.N</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420852/#Comment_420852" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T22:09:45+00:00" title="August 28, 2013 10:09PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks awesome, infinitely preferable to the rules heavy FFG game.

At the same time one of the techmarines squad moves felt too weak. So then, Tadaa!<br/><br/><b>Mission vows</b><br/><br/>When setting out on a mission the chosen Unit Leader leads his battle brothers in oath-taking before battle. Some battle brothers swear entire catalogues of oaths varying from general to extremely detailed. Other settle for simple reaffirmations of their space marine oaths.<br/><br/><br/>The unit leader gets to choose one mission oath that affects the entire unit. The nature of the oath depends on the leader\u2019s specialization but any unit leader can choose the general vows. Each vow comes with a bonus and a drawback.<br/><br/><br/>Should someone break the oath this entails a loss of one Glory and the character may not enter squad mode during the rest of the mission. Nobody likes oath breakers.<br/><br/><br/><b>General Vows</b><br/><br/><br/><b>Specialized Vows</b><br/><br/><br/><b>Techmarine</b><br/><i>Vow to take Blessed Care of thy Weapons</i>: During the mission the weapons employed by the squad will never jam. At all times the battle brothers are expected to conduct weapon care with the right unguents, incenses and prayers required.<br/><br/>[I wanted something that adds both mechanically and to the fiction. The techmarine's example gives a small bonus, the MC wont be using the jamming move against the players. All the while the characters will be checking their weapons over and over, admonished by the techmarine. Seems to strike the right balance. Now I just have to make up some more.]<br/><br/>I also relized that I had made a faux pas: I called getting into gang mode Enter squad mode. But squad mode is the once per mission ability of the Unit leader. So I changed that to squad move. Sounds better. SO the Techmarines choice of squad <i>moves</i> are:<br/><br/>Squad Move (if Unit Leader)<br/><br/>Chose one:<br/><br/>*Machine Martyr. Once during a mission you can turn any machine artifact with a power source into an extremely powerful explosive, ready to martyr itself for the mission.<br/>*Battlefield Blessed and Re-Canonized. Once during a mission your unusually elastic sense of propriety allows you to convert a non-imperial technological artifact into an approved avatar of the Omnissiah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420860/#Comment_420860" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-29T07:49:52+00:00" title="August 29, 2013  7:49AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Assault Marine</b><br/><br/>The Assault Marine brings the pure melee-centric hatred to the enemies of humankind. Even though up front head-bashing is the favoured method some specialize in close up demolitions work as well. Many assault marines give up any semblance of control to allow their brutal urges and trained reflexes deal death to the enemy while others pursue an expert\u2019s balanced melee mastery. The result nonetheless is always the same: total annihilation of the Emperor\u2019s enemies.<br/><br/><br/>The focused stat of the Assault Marine is Fight, and this is something he excels at.<br/><br/><br/><b>Stuff</b><br/><br/><b>Jumppack</b><br/><br/>You are equipped with a jet engine jumppack allowing you to take big bounding leaps over the battlefield and cover large stretches of ground in short time.

Through your extensive knowledge of melta charges and other high grade explosives you can destroy basically anything, or punch a way through any obstruction.

At the same time I wanted using the warp to be as dangerous as a fumbled roll in Deathwatch can end up being. So I ended up with the following; Use the Warp can be done by anyone, but is dangerous (humans are a phsycic breed after all), while the Librarian gets a crucial re-roll, and Attuned 3...<br/><br/>USE THE WARP<br/><br/>When you<br/><br/><b>Use the Warp</b> roll+Attuned.

You can trade harm for range, point for point.<br/>*Telepathy - contact anybody on the same planet as long as you have an idea of who and where they are.<br/>*Strength of Will - double the harm done with your melee weapons during this battle.<br/>*Augery - the MC will tell you something new and interesting about the current situation and in good detail.<br/>On a 7-9 choose one of the above but suffer 2 harm (AP)from acute brain hemorrhaging. On a miss you have attracted a warpbeast and something bad happens.<br/><br/><br/><b>Librarian</b><br/><br/>The warp is the unsteady parallel universe underpinning the entirety of existence. It is the home of daemons and ghosts and is dangerous in the extreme. It is also a source of power for those who know how to control it and at the same time the medium through which the Empire\u2019s ships traverse the unknowable distances between the stars. The Librarian, as keeper of the chapter\u2019s lore and psychic master, channels these dangerous powers of the warp to destroy enemies of humanity. It is said that anybody can call on the warp and open a rift, but only a librarian has the power to close it again. Yet, the warp is corruption in its purest form and any altercation with it can spell doom. Only the strongest of mind can hope to wield it as a weapon and hope to survive.<br/><br/><br/>As the librarian can sense the future through readings of the Emperor\u2019s Tarot only an unwise unit leader ignores a librarian\u2019s council.<br/><br/><b>Stuff</b><br/><br/><i>Psychic Hood</i><br/>A psychic hood often takes the shape of a metal collar that rises above the librarian\u2019s head. It is interlaced with a complex crystal matrix to help shield the librarian from the dangers of the warp.

On a miss you have attracted a warpbeast and something bad happens.<br/><br/><br/><b>Solo ability:</b> <i>Not yet done</i><br/><br/><b>Squad Move (if Unit Leader), choose one: </b><br/><br/><i>*Gate of Infinity</i>. You use your immense warpborn powers to teleport the unit anywhere within a planet system\u2019s distance. The only thing required is good intel on where you are supposed to end up. The side effect of this supreme effort is that you suffer 2harm (AP) due to brain hemorrhaging.<br/><br/><i>*Shield of the Emperor</i>. Drawing on the Immaterium\u2019s defiance of physical reality you weave a shield of pure warp energy. For a short duration of time you and any squad members in (close) range are impervious to any kind of external damage.

Of those I've only done one so far. I hope it strikes the right balance between game mechanics/flavor:<br/><br/><b>Ravenguard</b><br/>Swift death from the shadows is the motto of the Ravenguard. Stealth, sabotage, assassinations and guerilla warfare are the preferred methods of war employed by the XIX legion.

But despite all the secrecy they have a soft spot for humanity, often fighting against desperate odds to help beleaguered outposts of Imperial Guard or retreating refugees survive.<br/><br/><i>Special:</i> <b>Inscrutable</b>. Whenever someone tries to read you using the Read a person move they suffer -2 to the roll.<br/><br/><i>Geneseed:</i> Due to a dark event in their past Raven Guard space marines lack the following implants: Mucranoid gland and Betcher\u2019s gland. Also the Melanchromic organ has a mutation causing them to turn paler and paler while their hair and eyes turn coal black<br/><br/><i>Solo move:</i> <b>Strike from the shadows</b>. Whenever dealing damage on unsuspecting enemies add +1 harm to harm as established.<br/><br/><i>Hx</i> <br/>Everyone introduces their characters. Take your turn. Go around again for Hx. On your turn:<br/>*Choose one character you have been on a stealth mission with before, tell that character Hx+1.<br/>*Tell everyone else Hx 0. You do not share much about yourself. If there is a Salamander or Ultramarine say Hx+1 instead as you recognize your shared bond with humanity.<br/>On the other\u2019s turns:<br/>*Whatever they say add +1Hx.
