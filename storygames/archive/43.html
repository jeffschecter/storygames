                            P'shaw. Yeah, that's Ron. But he's always into that kind of hyperbole.  Fifth_Child on <b>RPGnet</b> pretty much nails it in one:<br/><br/><code>&lt;i&gt;I mean, the context is all right there.<br/><br/>You are, however, over-reacting. I mean, Ron says stuff sorta like this with surprising regularity. He's a coarse guy, and likes to dramatize the way he feels. Kinda like Jim Bob, actually. This does happen to be one of the more extreme examples I've seen, but the man has a reputation for this sort of thing.<br/><br/>What you're missing is that what he's saying actually boils down to nothing more than this:<br/><br/>&lt;b&gt;"I don't believe that traditional roleplaying games do a good job of getting people to think about stories, their function or their makeup or their design. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that getting too accustomed to the ways that rpgs work actually makes it harder for folks to grasp what makes a good story. And if it's harder for them to grasp what makes a good story, then obviously their ability to actually create one is going to suffer."&lt;/b&gt;<br/><br/>I'm not going to defend his choice of words - that's a shitstorm I'm totally unwilling to step into. What I'm saying is that his core idea has some merit - at least to me.<br/><br/>That's pretty characteristic of Ron Edwards, in my experience.&lt;/i&gt;</code><br/><br/>And honestly? I 98% fucking agree with Ron on his point (maybe not his choice of words). I've actually seen firsthand traditional gamers like myself have to "unbind" themselves from everything that they understood about gaming and storytelling to play games where they have total control over the direction of their player (including death) and more than "touchy-feely" control over the creation of the game. Maybe it's because games like PTA and RIFTS are really different games, but share the naming "Role-Playing Game"? I dunno.<br/><br/>But yeah, I've watched that Jim Bob (and cjh) guy's nipples get fucking hard every time he gets a chance to take a shot at the Forge, Ron, whatever. The guy just cannot fucking stop pointing out flaws in others. <br/><br/>I kinda ranted on the RPGNet thread, but literally I was just fed up with my own gov't after all the recent Rep/Dem overblown catfighting, and I kinda flew off the handle when I saw that same crap... and flung just to talk about games.  *sigh*<br/><br/>EDIT: Blah, RPGNet-inspired adrenaline rush over.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            It helps to actually meet people face to face, I think.  Once you meet them, you understand them a little better.  I spend some 8 or so days interacting here and there with Ron over two GenCons.  When you're in front of someone, and see how they act, you "get" them. You understand them a little more when they say stuff, and look a little harder for the context. <br/><br/>Hey, so Ron's a friend. So I end up looking a little harder into subtext when he says one of his Ron Things that makes me go, WTF?<br/><br/>But Ron aside, I try to look a little deeper at the words people write.  If they write something questionable, I say to myself, "Wait, what is this guy really saying?  I'll pretend that this guy is a friend, cut him some slack, and look a little bit deeper at what they're talking about". Sometimes it works. <br/><br/>But not a lot of other people do it.  cjh drove me up fucking walls in previous threads in the way he'd just take words out of context from "over face-valuing" them.  Jim-Bob's blatantly doing it, too. Where empathy is murdered, that is a place I will not venture.<br/><br/>Bah, enough of that, time to go to bed.  Later!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Levi said in the RPG.net thread that gamers were his family.  Rock on.<br/>
<br/>
However, that doesnt' mean you turn a blind eye to dysfunction in your own family.    I have watched too many of my friends turn away from gaming due to dysfunctional gamer culture, far away friends seperated from me by geography  who struggle with one fuct gaming group after another, one power-trip GM after another, gamers looking for just one good game.<br/>
<br/>
I love gamers too but that doesn't mean I love everything in our sub-culture.                        </div>

                            You don't turn a blind eye, that's true.  <br/>
<br/>
Nor, I think, should we point and sneer, if we can avoid it.  What you do is find things of value, ways to get past those problems.  And then you try to share them - with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing what Andy says, I can accept that Ron is just this guy that talks shit sometimes, to get to point across, and this is just an example of that.   I still don't like hearing that shit - hell, every so often I spout some myself, and I regret it every time.<br/>
<br/>
I can also accept that Jim-Bob is making a point, in *his* rough shit-talking way, whether or not I agree.<br/>
<br/>
So.  This is our dysfunctional family.  What do we do?                        </div>

We can shut the fuck up and just game and write about how it worked and how it didn't.  <br/>
<br/>
All of this writing about X wrote this and Y wrote that...who the fuck cares.<br/>
<br/>
Let's use forum space to make our gaming better, to tell people what worked for us and what didn't and try and figure out why.  <br/>
<br/>
Next time anyone is tempted to post a response to a petty limp-dick thread ask yourself why you aren't with your friends making shit up or helping someone else to make shit up.<br/>
<br/>
I was being funny but there's honesty there.<br/>
<br/>
Levi, your threads about putting game theory into your own words...brilliant.  Because you see, those threads aren't an attack on the Forge or Ron Edwards or anyone who digs game theory.  It is THEORY.  It is a dialogue, a process and you were adding you voice to it.  Rock on.<br/>
<br/>
So keep that shit up and make sure every word you write is backed up by a good lot of gaming.                        </div>

And you can be pushy if you want, man.  I can live with pushy; in this case, I can even be quite pleased by where it's sending me.<br/>

I'll be glad to hear more from you in future on RPGnet, as well, should that occur - though I don't actually know who you are on there.                        </div>

                            The entire gaming spectrum is on RPGnet.  It's one, giant, darwinian idea pool.  I've read statements there of unspeakable brilliance, sandwiched firmly between between confusion and egotism.  <br/>
<br/>
No matter what the idea is, someone there will fight you over it.  And that's awesome.  In fact, I think it's incredible.<br/>
<br/>
I've had ideas that I took there see more development and input in a day than they get in a month anywhere else.  Yes, some of it was brutal and petty; and that shows me where my idea was open to attack.  Some of it was constructive and creative, showing me entirely new things.<br/>

That's why I love the place.                        </div>

                            I've said it before, and I'll say it again - if you wanna talk the talk, you gotta walk the walk. Here, that means you gotta be playing games. <br/>
<br/>
One cool thing about RPG.net is that a lot of the people there are actually playing, and they talk about it. A lot of it is functional, fun play. There's good stuff to be had there. <br/>
<br/>
Tony and Ben had a great convo about the uses and value of the place that I was privy too - but basically that there is value in being active in what interests you, and polite and direct in those conversations. I'm trying to apply some of their thoughts to my interactions there, and we'll see how it goes.                        </div>

Maybe it's because games like PTA and RIFTS are really different games, but share the naming "Role-Playing Game"? I dunno.</i><br/><br/>Dude!!  I think that's a totally different statement.  It's one thing to say "Playing Rifts instills habits that make it difficult to play Primetime Adventures".  That's sounds fine to me, and makes a lot of sense.  Learning to play rock-and-roll instills habits that cause problems for classical music, and vice-versa.  <br/><br/>The difference between your and Ron's statements seems like more than word choice, though.  But is someone who has trouble getting used to PtA considered "brain damaged"?  Is there any objective basis for this?

<p>You know that bit in Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind where he asks: <code>Can this cause brain damage?</code> and is told <code>technically, it IS brain damage</code> - maybe that's the  charitable reading. Not that it globally stunts cognitive function, but it creates patterns of thinking that are so pervasive that for a single narrow subfield - the creation of story, as widely understood - problems occur. That's my read, with brain damage a colorful reach from mental dysfunction.</p>

<br/>
Regarding RPG.net, I read it regularly and post occasionally. Which is pretty much my behavior on other forums too. <br/>
<br/>
Posters on RPG.net often frustrate me, seem closed-minded and unreceptive to any sort of change. But there are some real gems there too. Regardless of their personalities (some are quite nice and others exceptionally nasty), most of them are there because they love games.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, as Levi said, RPG.net exposes me to a vast array of gamers. And if I, as a game writer/designer/editor want to be able to express myself properly to consumers of my works, then I cannot allow myself to fall into a gaming ghetto. I need to be exposed to people that play games very differently than I do.<br/>
<br/>
When something finally demands that I respond, I often find that the resulting discussion (or war) causes me to really refine my ideas and make them digestible to others.<br/>
<br/>
Also, RPG.net is probably the most effective way that I see right now to reach gamers about my games. If you really want to get your game out there, you need to spend time at RPG.net and start building it up. And that's not just jumping into every thread and evangelizing your game. It means getting involved in the community there and becoming a recognizable personality.                        </div>

                            Thanks for that, Thor.  Others have told me that I ought to dive in to rpg.net and make a presence there, too.  How would you suggest getting involved in the community?  It's pretty rare that I see a thread I'd want to post to.  Should I review more games?  Adjust my expectations?  My experiences there, whcih go back a ways, are entirely negative.                        </div>

                            Most of the time I find those rants to be targeting a faceless entity. I often identify with the ideas the ranter is ranting against, but I haven't yet seen a "Matt is a dick because he has a forum on the Forge" or anything similar. Some people don't like my games, and sometimes they're pretty, uh, expressive about it, but they don't call me at home and tell me. It always generates at least one sale, though.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are just kind of wacky about their extreme stance, and they're not really worth getting entangled with (like debating welfare with Ann Coulter). I'm usually content with just kind of giving it a Hurleyesque 'whatever, dude' and going about my business as usual, or IMing someone with a private and snarky WTF.                        </div>

<br/>
Post about your actual play. Not too heavy on the analysis, but bring up the fun stuff that happened in play. Showcase some of the cool stuff the system does.<br/>
<br/>
Play games other than the one you're designing, and talk about them and the cool stuff they do.<br/>

I am one of the brain damaged. To an extent. By which I mean to say that by my perspective, we gamers have simply fallen in love with something that is different than "story." Meaning that, yes, we try to mash stories to make them more like...well, that thing we like. Take the behavior of looking at a Star Trek episode and saying, "How the heck did that holographic snow get out of the holodeck!" As if traveling faster than the speed of light weren't improbable enough, we have to have *consistent improbability!*<br/>
<br/>
Which I think is fine. Ron laments the loss of ability to enjoy story as he does, but I'm not too concerned. That is, I think he's absolutely correct in all particulars, and my response is "so what." Rather, he should do as he's doing and target normies, and we should do as we do and target gamers. <br/>

<em>I also think that trying to say that all RPGs *ought* to be that way is plainly wrong.</em><br/><br/>Yeah, that leads to all kinds of bad blood.<br/><br/>I think the key for avoiding this is to explain the difference between "story experiencing" and "story creation". Lots of people build their identity around "story above all", but mean experiencing story, not makign it, and for somebody to tell them they aren't doing what they perceive themselves as doing, causes animosity. Clarify the difference in what you're talking about, and it all clicks.<br/><br/>Which, co-incidently is what I think is cool about your recent RPG.NET threads. They manage to highlight the distinctions in an accessible way. I saw people who have ignored or lambasted the Big Model go "oh, yeah, right, that's what they mean".<br/><br/>-Matt                        </div>

                            I think something to keep in mind is that it's not <b>individuals</b> that Ron is railing against, but rather the <b>hobby/culture</b> of role-playing. Ron loves roleplaying as an activity and role-players, but he can't stand "the hobby", which is largely socially dysfunctional. <br/><br/>Also, when he says that he sees an embryo of change, he's talking about something that's forming from within the hobby. It's something we all are apart of. Mike H, you're certainly NOT one of the damaged. Though games like Dogs, PTA, Capes, etc. may themselves be "prosthetics", they (along with the people who play them) are also pieces of that embryo.<br/><br/>Also, on the "brain damage" front, I certainly wouldn't have used those words, but I agree with what he's saying. It's true that what we <i>do</i> changes how we think. My wife, who's about to graduate law school, constantly comments how law school has change her personality and the way that she thinks. She also comments how the way she relates to people is different now than it was before law school.                        </div>

PTA is as far outside the 'norm' as it is largely because of the feedback I got from my non-gamer wife, to whom most of it seemed so obvious. It'd be more outside the norm if I hadn't chickened out, and if I'd listened less to gamers as a whole.                        </div>

                            One thing that we should keep in mind, for those of us who agree with Ron, is that it will take time and transition to undamage gamers.  New games will have to be developed.  New ideas (Pull, Player-less Games, etc.) will take time to percolate.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately it seems a new idea or statement will be presented and everyone will run off half-cocked and scream from the high hills about it.  Whether they are for or against it, they scream their heads off.  These new ideas need games and designs to test them and to provide a good context to talk about them.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<p>I don't agree.</p>
<p>The idea in this case is not that astonishing.  The idea, as I see it, after careful looking, is:</p>
<p><em>Current games aren't built to produce stories in any true sense of the word story.  The habits we have as players of and as people thinking about games are not structured in a way that will produce such stuff.  As it is, some of our habits are actively hostile to producing all of the depths of stuff that exist in story.</em></p>
<p>That, combined with the belief that we cannot unlearn this habits, and a truly vitriolic and inflammatory wording, is all I see.</p>
<p>If I miss something, it's because of the wording.  Not because of the idea.</p>
<p>When new statements and ideas are presented and people run and screm, they do so purely because it's truly hateful to people to have someone condescend to them - and more so if the person doing the condescending has a point.</p>
