Or rather, they are powerful on the encounter level, and that's what they control.  The DMG is pretty clear that the DM can tune how much power those encounters have on the game as a whole.  There is the "Episodic" no power level, and the "Full Power" loosely structured, largely improvised, player driven campaign. Both of these styles are given equal footing with the typical "DM structured campaign plot, modified by player actions and characer goals" middle ground as a default assumption.  But I don't see anything that enforces powerlessness as the given way to play. Depending on how you use skill challenges, players could potentially have as much control over the course of things as they do in In A Wicked Age.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160839/#Comment_160839" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T13:26:41+00:00" title="August  5, 2008  1:26PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha, I think that's why I actually prefer D&amp;D.

Say the players are fighting the Dragonmen of the fortress of Darknell.  Even under the guidelines of how to structure level-appropriate combats, the PCs' victory over the Dragonmen doesn't accomplish anything unless the GM lets it.  The GM can - unintentionally - make that entire thing irrelevant, because <br/><br/>* Dragonmen could just re-take the fortress while the PCs are away.<br/>or<br/>* There's another tribe of dragonmen just over the hill.  <br/>or<br/>* The fortress isn't that important in the greater scheme of things.<br/><br/>Likewise, say I'm a mighty barbarian Fighter, and I want to become chief of my tribe.  I've got all these nifty powers, but I can only become chief of my tribe if the GM allows it and - the GM has to deliberately work to facilitate it.<br/><br/>Basically, I can defeat ten skeletons, and the GM is completely within his rights to say that there's ten more skeletons right around the corner.  Or that wasn't really the Lich's phylactery.  Or that no one is interested in joining my newly consecrated temple to my god of justice.<br/><br/>The thing that bugs me is that even in 4e I'm expected to do all the work to make the players' contributions <i>matter</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160878/#Comment_160878" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T15:37:49+00:00" title="August  5, 2008  3:37PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please let me repeat: I've been trying to get excited for 4e because I really want to like it.

You want a game that has a kind of "social contract law" built in, it sounds like. <br/><br/>That's cool, but it might also be worth just trying laying out a pretty clear social contract with your group. Even if they're not used to it, tell them "you need to tell me what you're trying to accomplish with this adventure, then we have some cool encounters (combat/social/skill/whatever), and if you succeed then you get your goal, otherwise something goes wrong." I think the best games of D&amp;D I've played have felt more or less like Primetime Adventures or Dogs with combat and other D&amp;D crunch as a resolution system The group states an intent, there's some adventuring to resolve said intent, and then the story moves along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160899/#Comment_160899" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T16:44:01+00:00" title="August  5, 2008  4:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2008 4:44PM by Ron Hammack.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite>Hey, DM, us clearing out this place means Dragonmen are done, right?<br/>or heck, maybe the group WANTS to keep fighting them...they're going to for a "Epic Struggle" feel to their game:<br/>Hey, DM, it'd be totally cool if some of these guys escaped 'cause I'm enjoying kicking their ass!</blockquote>Yeah, but the game doesn't help me make the choice.

If you play lunch money (the card game), you don't make up some story about how your little christian school girl is falling in love with the rough boy down the road - you block, grab, power play, HAIL MARY!!!<br/><br/>Perhaps you should, when imagining the players making contributions outside of the scope of the game, stop thinking of indulging them. No, just because it's a roleplay game doesn't mean anyone gets to make a temple or marry a princess or whatever the hell everyone decides to think up.<br/><br/>Or is it that you don't want to have to break it to them? You know more than half want to play D&amp;D yet ignore the system and go on some big temple making fantasy and - they are just completely misstaken.<br/><br/>I dunno what to do in that case. Usually when I say a given roleplay books contents aren't about doing whatever the hell you can think of, people balk and flail at me. I dunno what to do, except Block! Grab! Powerplay!

I used to GM D&amp;D a lot, I think the new ruleset eliminates many of the problems I used to run into.  Also, I genuinely want to engage with all these people who want to game with me.  Also, I spent $100 on the books.<br/><br/>But yeah, I might be a lost cause.  Here's an example of my lost-causery.

Why should I put work into creating adventures if ultimately my role can be met by a random encounter table? <br/><br/>Because ultimately your role <i>can't</i> be met by a random encounter table.<br/><br/>In my experience, when it comes to "whomp the monsters and level up" style D&amp;D, context and story aren't irrelevant at <i>all.</i> I've <i>played</i> in games before where the DM was pretty much just grabbing random crap out of the Monster Manual to throw at us and my <i>Gods</i> is it boring.<br/><br/>In a well run whomp-the-monsters campaign there's <i>just enough</i> story to tie all those encounters together so the <i>don't</i> feel random. Story isn't the focus of the game, but it still needs to be there. It's like the plots of cheesy old kung-fu movies. "You killed my father, now you must DIE!!" isn't exactly deep storytelling, but it's enough to make it a <i>movie</i> about kung-fu asskicking and not just a compilation of random fight scenes.<br/><br/>Also, you left the most important line of Z-Dog's post out of your quote: "The challenge is in designing interesting combat encounters." That's something a random encounter chart just can't do.\n<blockquote>Conversely, if you're playing to level up, you're playing to secure my permission to be a powerful character in my fictional universe; permission I could grant at any time but which i withhold and parcel out in small chunks.  "Make 30th level characters.  You win."</blockquote>\nLemme dig my Gamist hat out of the closet for a minute here...<br/><br/>If you're playing to level up, you're playing to earn bigger numbers on your character sheet through superior skill, creative tactics, and a bit of luck. You know that the DM could, if he wanted, kick your character's ass with unbeatable encounters or hand-hold you through the levels with ridiculously easy ones, but you trust him not to do that, because it's lame. Also, if you're lucky, you'll have a DM who rolls all his dice out in the open so that you <i>know</i> he's not fudging (either for your or against you), and you might even have one who's willing to <i>show his math</i> (i.e., "OK, these guys are <i>level eight</i>, so if you want to just give up now and play some Candyland or something, I'll understand. No? All right, then, roll initiative!")<br/><br/>You also know that the DM might <i>accidentally</i> screw up and throw overly-easy or overly-hard encounters at you, but luckily the newer editions of the game have gotten progressively better at teaching DMs how to craft appropriately challenging encounters, so you don't worry about that as much as you used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160943/#Comment_160943" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T21:42:46+00:00" title="August  5, 2008  9:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, I might be reading this wrong, but isn't this problem pretty much the quintissential problem behind *any* combat-themed RPG?

You might be seeing it exemplified here, but I think it is general.<br/><br/>The part of the picture that you seem to be missing (from my perspective - might be wrong) is that the integrity of the GM Imagined Space is a major unspoken rule in almost all trad game designs.<br/><br/>Trad games, particularly trad D&amp;D, assume that the GM designs and defines an environment - perhaps a social network, perhaps a nation, more likely a clearly bounded location like a dungeon - and then commits him- or herself to maintaining the integrity of that environment in play. Every player action matters because it changes the environment and has an impact on the GMIS.<br/> <br/>This is more or less a social contract issue. The players expect that the GM is staying true to an internal model of the world. When the GM has not closely defined the world, they are free to make decisions that fit with what is already known - "yep, there's more Dragonborn nearby!" - even if those decisions seem to negate apparent player success. The GM is trusted to make these decisions based on their internal model of what is reasonable about the world while balancing player enjoyment. A GM could abuse this - and, in fact, given the way this is an unspoken assumption, it frequently is abused, the classic example being "whichever door you choose happens to lead to the trap, because I want to run the trap" - and if they do it skillfully, the players may never realise. But that doesn't change the base expectation, which is that the GM will present a world with integrity.<br/><br/>In terms of addressing this, I feel that 4E actually goes further into this than any D&amp;D-alike beforehand. The Quest system requires defined conclusions to setting-changing activities, so players can earn XP from them.

That's exactly why you are drawn to it, isn't it? The game prep?<br/><br/>It sounds like the opposite to me. It sounds like you have to do all the work to take away their contributions. Having the Dragonmen return, or there be more of them, and actually making their victory hollow - that's a lot of work. But chances are, the victory won't be hollow. If you have the Dragonmen retake the fortress, chances are they are stronger, tougher Dragonmen, prepared for the PCs because they know the PCs are a threat. Same for the Dragonmen over the hill. There are greater numbers and greater stakes (is it a massing army? The heart of the evil Dragonmen empire? The location of a portal linking to their homeland?)<br/><br/>All that stuff you develop during your prep. During your commute. It's exactly that.  The central system is defeating challenges (4E has combat or non-combat finally) to progress up a chain of power (magic items, levels). It facilitates escalating stories really easily with very little work needed. 4E even gives you great break points. The Heroic Tier is something that effects a region or nation, culminating at level 10. Paragon tier is something that effects a continent or even the world. The Epic tier is about saving all the worlds, or the universe.  And you know what, in the grand scheme, yeah that fortress of Dragonmen at level 3 was probably not so pivotal to the challenges you face at level 13 or 23, but it was a step, a link in the chain. You job is to make it more than "who gives a fuck" dragonmen and make the link important, at least for level 3, probably for a large story arc, maybe all the way to 10. Finding something bigger around the corner, or finding the situation is getting worse isn't negating player choices. It's building dramatic tension.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age has no system for making player choices matter. The system only covers conflicts between two or more people. After negotiation is done for a conflict, there's a wide variety of options that could negate what just occured, or lessen the impact. But why would you do that?<br/><br/>So, if you don't want to play stories of escalating gonzo fantasy adventure that builds as the characters gain power, then D&amp;D 4E is a bad choice. But there's nothing about it that negates player accomplishments. You could run it that way. But why would you do that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161013/#Comment_161013" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T10:23:51+00:00" title="August  6, 2008 10:23AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2008 10:25AM by John_Powell.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan: less QQ and more pew-pew.

In my experience, good GMs running such games (as pointed out, most traditional RPGs) create for themselves some sort of specific game within the game, something that allows them to separate contradictory motivations. You have to work hard creating fictional material, running the game, being referee, creating challenges for the players, and getting some sort of story out of it... all at the same time. Something's gotta go.<br/><br/>Some examples (from real life):<br/><br/>* A GM whose whole mission is a creative challenge: Here's some random stuff that happens in the game, due to die rolls, players not making it on a certain night, etc. How well can tie the whole thing into a great story? This GM would create interesting twists, showing how a certain character was actually some other character in disguise, etc. None of it was pre-planned. It was just a tremendous creative challenge for him. Everyone had a good time, although I could see this going terribly wrong as well.<br/><br/>* Be "the computer". The GM takes a module written by someone else, makes his own, or even uses a whole "campaign setting" that is detailed enough that once the game starts, the GM can be as impartial as possible, just reading the die rolls and announcing the outcomes. The small-scale example is a small dungeon. There is no ambiguity along the lines of "do the players achieve their goals", since if the module says there's an ogre with a big treasure chest and no one else around, when the PCs defeat the ogre, it's pretty obvious they've got the treasure. The large-scale example is something like the West Marches campaign on that guy's blog, whose name I have forgotten for the moment. You have everything set up from the beginning, and your job is just to see it unfold. The fun is in seeing how the players react to what you have predesigned and how everything turns out. Like running a simulation or an obstacle course.<br/><br/>* Use some sort of specific social contract to make the whole thing make sense. Some examples include:<br/><br/>1. The "Bringing Down the Dungeon" method, where the group agrees to use a specific encounter or series of encounter as a mode of conflict resolution. ("If you defeat the Ogre of ... the King will pardon your sister.")<br/><br/>2. Some form of campaign creation that is collaborative. If the players are thoroughly engaged in the process, the GM's job becomes more manageable as the game takes on a life of its own. For example, the players could each create dungeons or outline specific challenges their character faces ("I'm on a quest to bring my father back to life, and I'd like the defining moment, where I succeed or fail, to take the form of a fight with three ogres on a ship's deck").<br/><br/>Any of this helpful to you?

To get to it, though, you have to kill these orcs. Otherwise, you get asparagus!" In my experience, even with varying levels of player involvement, it works great. The story evolves based on everybody's input as channeled through the rules, which is what I (and I think many others) want to get out of a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>OMG!

Talk about the kind of game you want to play. Get everyone on the same page.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you know the players/characters/setting/situation you can go from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nVanilla we all meet in the tavern and get handed a map by an old man to a local dungeon? Cool. It can go anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the PCs is the secret love child of the now deceased king who was the only one who could hold back the coming rage of zombie undead legions? And what's that sound scratching at the door? Could it be death? Cool. It's going to go from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand your frustrations. I really do. I think, though, in the absence of Characters/Setting/Situation, we're kinda going to be talking in circles.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Ken                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161042/#Comment_161042" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T14:34:34+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  2:34PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys.

It so fueled my mind that, for me, the PHB entries for each character <i>effectively end at Level 10</i> (or 11, the first level of Paragon). So it served as an entry point for me to really enjoy 4E as well.<br/><br/>So, I'm interested in seeing what you come up with!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161046/#Comment_161046" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T14:53:48+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  2:53PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why, man, you're welcome.

So if the book is boring, it's boring in the same way that a guitar or a box of crayons is boring... until you use your creativity and skill to do something interesting with it.<br/>If it's a toolkit, it should be called a role play toolkit. A game is interesting even before your creativity is applied. If it's a toolkit, there's a snake oil dishonesty in it being sold as a roleplay <i>game</i>. It'd be like selling a mechanics toolkit as a 'game'.<br/><br/>You think it's a toolkit, I think it's supposed to be a game. It could be either, that's cool between us. But surely we'd agree that when an object is X, but sold as Y, there's dishonesty going on with the seller?<br/><br/>EDIT: Okay, on second thought I started a new thread for this (I always think I'm just going to add a short post, but then it always ends up longer): <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7239" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7239</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161082/#Comment_161082" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T19:29:21+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  7:29PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any time, Ryan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread has reminded me of something, which I shall fork off into a new thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trithemius" title="Trithemius"><img alt="Trithemius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trithemius">Trithemius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162328/#Comment_162328" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T18:40:39+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  6:40PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan</cite>I'm not going to be one of the guys who says "D&amp;D can be whatever you want to make it!" It can't. However,<i>if you really want to play D&amp;D and this is the only obstacle to your fun,</i>a simple DM-specific house rule or two might help you out. "Say yes or roll the dice" is a popular one. "Don't be an ass" is another.</blockquote>\nHow is "don't be an ass" a house rule? Isn't it the necessary precondition to having fun in a game?<br/><br/>I personally don't see that D&amp;D has any special weaknesses when it comes to the sort of GM who just wants to crush people down in the game. This can happen in the Burning Wheel if the players let it; it can probably happen in just about any game where there is a facilitator-role. It seems to me that it has a lot more to do with the enduring social effect of generations of play than the design of the game.<br/><br/>Which is, I should add, not to imply that it does not have design flaws.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7229/omg-i-think-i-know-why-i-cant-get-excited-for-4e" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7229/omg-i-think-i-know-why-i-cant-get-excited-for-4e" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7229/omg-i-think-i-know-why-i-cant-get-excited-for-4e/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7229%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7229%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
