Here's the simple scoop:<br/><br/><br/>- SYSTEM: Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition<br/>- WHERE: my apt in Magnolia, Seattle<br/>- WHEN: weekly, Fridays, 5:30pm - 11pm (very roughly on average)<br/>- DM/PLAYERS: 3-4 players, round robin DMing action<br/>- STYLE: Laid back action "popcorn drama" (think "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" style. Not too goofy but not super serious. We're all in our 30s so, a fun evening of "killing monsters and taking their stuff" old-school style after a work-week, is the fun we're having!<br/><br/><br/>- WHAT: we're playing in the basic D&amp;D4 fantasy cosmology, making our own map as we go - in a "timeline" current with the 1980s "world" of D&amp;D (meaning Orcus is dead and ready to return, etc...). We're DMing "round robin" (which means with each new module/story every 1-6 game sessions a new player steps up to DM when they want). We've been updating alot of the old-school modules to play in 4e. Example: Ravenloft, Slavelords, and currently "A Paladin In Hell"!<br/><br/>We're playing a "fast forward" 5-6 sessions of "Paladin" right now (just started) at 29th level. After that our plan is to have our characters "slapped down" to 8th level and continue the campaign as we had up to 8th level. (We wanted to TRY a test of how HIGH level play was for an adventure).<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you're interested email me off list.<br/>kevperrine@ yahoo.com<br/><br/>thanks!<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
