(All two or three of them, heh.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The short version:</b> Rather than ask whether it's trad or indie (or scarier still, fight about which is better), I think the better question to ask about a game is: What does it have rules for, what doesn't it have rules for, and how does that help you have fun?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The long version:</b> Rules address some aspect of the collective play experience. There are also some aspects of the play experience that a given game's rules don't address. What the rules don't address are resolved by some kind of consensus. The parts of play experience that a rule might or might not address can be roughly divided into Description and Drama.<br/>\n<br/>\nRules that cover Description basically model the workings of the virtual reality in play, such as sword skills, diplomacy, drowning, explosions, etc. Rules about Drama don't correspond to what happens in the virtual reality the characters inhabit (think Screen Presence from Primetime Adventures), but are more about how narrative is structured and what participants want out of the game. This is of course more a spectrum than an absolute divide, though there are some fairly clear-cut examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany games have rules that cover both to some degree (for instance, 7th Sea has mostly Descriptive rules with some Drama rules in the form of drama dice, backgrounds and such), but there is often some disparity in coverage between the two. Most "trad" games and also a good number of "indie" games have rules that center primarily on Description, while Drama is usually handled by some form of consensus, mostly GM decisions with player suggestion and input.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, heavily Drama-centered games have well-defined rules for Drama (think Polaris, Primetime Adventures, Dogs in the Vineyard), but Description in the sense of in-world likelihood is by consensus--usually, anything goes until and unless someone balks. My favorite example of this is from a Sons of Kryos podcast, where one of the hosts said there's nothing in the DitV rules stopping you from shooting down the moon on the other guy's head. The other participants have to stop you, if they are so inclined.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is more fun is a matter of taste and not a matter of meaningful debate. However, the effect of a configuration of rules and consensus, and the forms consensus might take, can be debated in terms of how well it serves a particular need or taste. For instance, many say Description-centered games are more fun for them because there's more consistency, more strategy, and that consensus is enough to get a great story going. Maybe they're right! And that's a matter of debate, unlike the supposed indie-trad split.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111157/#Comment_111157" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T14:43:16+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  2:43PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A tangential comment: Isn't the dichotomy you're offering \u2014 i e, that between descriptive rules and drama rules \u2014 a false dichotomy in itself?

They're just very rough categories of things rules might handle, and as I said, many games have both categories of rules.

(My experience is, not very.) <br><br>Anyway, it's my hope that y'all will help me play with this thing until it either breaks or stands. If it breaks, all the better.

That's why I called it a configuration of rules and consensus. For instance, in a more description-centered ruleset the absence of drama rules allows the course of events to arise spontaneously from the laws of the fictional reality, letting events go in all sorts of unexpected conclusions. In a drama-centered ruleset the absence of descriptive rules speed up both the learning and playing process, and get the laws of virtual reality out of the way of drama. In a largely descriptive game with some elements of drama such as drama points, the drama rules ameliorate some of the harshness of the descriptive rules. And so on. <br/><br/>With no rules for either category the configuration is entirely different, so it can't be simple addition. Without the consistency of descriptive rules, there's less impetus to drive the course of events in unexpected directions in the absence of drama rules. Without drama rules eliciting and resolving the participants' creative visions, the lack of descriptive rules don't necessarily speed things up because everything now requires consensus. Though on a plus side, I suppose the learning curve is nil. On the other hand, however, now the entire process depends on the communication structure and human interaction between the participants, which is pretty dangerous territory. There's no separation of relationships and roleplaying, which in my experience results in more hesitation, more holding back, dissatisfaction, and sometimes hurt feelings. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I love your "Short Version*.

See, I was thinking along the same lines while I wrote the original post, particularly about My Life with Master and the interaction of  self-loathing, love, and weariness. That's where I felt the drama-description category to be incomplete, and the reason I called it a spectrum and not a firm divide. If I went with the spectrum, I'd point the rules like you mentioned and MLwM towards the middle of the spectrum. Perhaps a better way to categorize such rules, however, is as genre emulation, or simulation. Hmm... Does this break the drama-description divide, or does it still tenuously cling to life due to being a spectrum? The categorization isn't perfect but it does explain a lot of games and what I saw of gaming. \n<blockquote>(I agree that some rules emulate "game world physics", and others exist to allow the players to create greater drama... but haven't we also seen a bunch of games that use mechanics in a totally different way in the last 6-7 years?

HP, for instance, arguably exists to give players an interesting combat challenge, but in consistent application it also forms a part of the in-game reality that there's no death spiral and anything that isn't dead might still take you out with a critical blow. Virtual reality, in other words, is shaped around the game's vision of fun, which I consider an important element of descriptive rules or the lack thereof.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
