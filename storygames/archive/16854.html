In doing so I've been working on trying to put a really hefty bit of GM advice in it but while writing I made up a session planning sheet for writing down a challenge, the NPCs characters could meet, if one of the PCs get the spotlight, etc etc. I was thinking about it yesterday, and I was imagining that the sheet could be used by players to make up the game as they went.<br/><br/>I figured it could go something like this, at the end of a scene (or more accurately when a challenge has been overcome) the players roll on one of their two attributes, their IQ or their Intuition (their choice, probably going with whatever is higher) to see if they deduce something from information they already had or they discover something new. If they pass their rolls, they get to fill in a number of the boxes based on how good their roll was. When they pass, I was thinking of providing a short list of descriptors like "baffling", "wondrous", "heroic" etc. Generally things that are light and enjoyable for them to base what they're filling out in the page. Other ideas like "with great power comes great responsibility" could mean that only one of the players has the ability to save the rest.<br/><br/>If there are still slots on the page open, they would start going around the table describing one slot at a time but this time they pick from descriptors like "the worst", "fearful", "escape is the only option" etc. Thing that are reversals for the players.<br/><br/>There are some things about the order that things should go in when there are slots open and some other procedural situations I'm not sure of. I figure that each player would put their initials next to the items they write down and get control of the element they define.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure my group would abuse this the first couple of times we did this but I'm hoping they'd pick up on the responsibility after a while. Other than a few minor details in rolling mechanics this could be a pretty universal system for making a game GMless.<br/><br/>Just looking at this, is there any helpful advice that you'd have? Are there any gotchas that you notice? Would this work with an experienced GMless group?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384315/#Comment_384315" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-04T16:08:31+00:00" title="July  4, 2012  4:08PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It certainly sounds interesting and nothing immediately leaps out at me as a gotcha.

It's the last page of <a href="http://www.theartifact.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Game-Preperation.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> file. It's nothing revolutionary, just some text boxes with different elements in them. I think any special sauce would have to come into play with how the responsibility for driving the story would play out and if two elements defined by different players came into play at the same time. I'm thinking I'd like to play test the idea, maybe this weekend and see if I can get it to work at all. <br/><br/>Any ideas for descriptors that would make for interesting story?

I'm reasonably confident that it will need some tweaking if this gets off the ground. When you look at the sheet, there are three challenge boxes. Each one has a choice for the players to make and what the general consequence is. There's a spot for a player spotlight, this may be a strong spotlight or a soft one that's up to the players. You could grab the spotlight for yourself or put someone else in it. The idea for this box would be to describe why that player is spotlighted. Then there's a box for an NPC or NPCs.<br/><br/>I figure play would start by all the players rolling, the best results go first followed down to the ones that fail their rolls at which point it would go around the table. On a really good roll one player could define the whole scene, I'm not sure I like that. Maybe everyone gets to modify or add to already filled in boxes until everyone gets a say?<br/><br/>The first player to fill in a box gets ownership of that element and manages it. At the beginning of the challenge the players describe the challenge and how the elements fit together in the same order they were written down. Then the players start play normally. This is where I think my players will have the hardest time. Some of them are pretty passive and if they were put out in front, I think they'd have a hard time getting the ball rolling.<br/><br/>So this'll either be a disaster or it'll work out just fine dependent on who rolls best. Unfortunately the player that is most likely to thrive in this situation is a habitually poor roller.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
