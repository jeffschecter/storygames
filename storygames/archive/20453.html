Not knowing whether you are the protagonist or the antagonist.  Or maybe you're just a supporting character, or comedic foil?<br/><br/>Do you think such a thing would interest you?<br/><br/>Maybe the more you played, the more likely you would succeed at fulfilling the story's need because you would've figured out your role in the story?  That would hint at some sort of success/failure paradigm.  Failure does happen in story, but it's usually something the protagonist does.  Supporting characters rarely fail, that is until the protagonist doesn't require their support.  <br/><br/>It's wrong-headed, but so are rpgs trying to be stories.<br/><br/>Have other games done this? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449780/#Comment_449780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-27T21:46:36+00:00" title="November 27, 2015  9:46PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I understand your question.

Task resolution could be handled by asking the other players (who know your role) what happens. They would make a collective yes/no decision based on "would a [role] do that/be able to do that?"

Two examples:<br/><br/><b>Roll for screen presence.</b><br/><br/>Alexander Cherry ( <a href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">@Lxndr</a> I think) came up with a very interesting mechanic for our contest game <i>Out There</i> (a sort of "make an X-Files episode" game).  In each scene, you rolled for which detectives appeared, but also for which NPCs did.  <br/><br/>I never discussed his intent with Alexander, but one of the results was that "whose story is this?" wound up being emergent.  It wouldn't take much tweaking to extrapolate "oh, weird, so I guess this character is in this scene" into "...so I guess that implies a role other than what we thought!"  I could absolutely see myself making an investigator character and then finding out partway through play that they're the killer the party is hunting.  I can also see starting out as GM and finding one of my NPCs turning into a star protagonist (as long as traditional GM duties aren't fixed in the hands of one person; easy enough to let that fall out from scene roles too, e.g. "if you have no character in this scene, GM it").<br/><br/><b>Compete to be GM.</b><br/><br/>I have a draft of a game where one player starts as the protagonist and everyone else competes to be GM by offering the character various opportunities.  Whoever the player picks most wins, and gets to be GM.  The losing GMs could take on other roles depending on how they lost or what happened in the meantime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449833/#Comment_449833" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-01T08:20:35+00:00" title="December  1, 2015  8:20AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2015 9:40AM by Rickard.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda do that in Imagine, and I know other people that want to explore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu" rel="nofollow">kishotenketsu</a> model in roleplaying games. Taken from one of the logs:\n<blockquote>Kish\u014dtenketsu has an interesting relationship with change.  With Shakespeare the environment reflects the moral status of the protagonist. As King Lear becomes a tyrant his kingdom falls into ruin. This feeds the monomyth. Kish\u014dtenketsu is the opposite. The protagonist is contextualised by the 3rd step. The protagonist is a critically thinking participant in their environment who is influenced by statements that don't originate from themselves. The monomyth hero is the centre of the universe and knows it or chooses to ignore it.</blockquote>\nI wont link to Imagine because you need to play it to understand it.

This is a remarkably sound way to do this sort of thing, since stories in roleplaying are generally best constructed retroactively.<br/><br/>This is not, however, what you play <i>Ribbon Drive</i> to find out; it is not a goal towards which most players are working, and only someone who has played the game a few times is likely to really be aware of this rule enough to take it into account in their play.

As they progress (if they progress) they begin to stand out, to take on the illusion of unique characters with individual traits and foibles.  This is mostly a matter of randomness and projection, of course, but hey, what else are we talkin' about?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450089/#Comment_450089" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T16:44:35+00:00" title="December 17, 2015  4:44PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 Roll for Shoes<br/><br/>Isn't also <i>Fiasco</i> kind of like this?

You do not act or pretend to find out what type of character you are.  And even if you do, it doesn't present itself that well.  I'm talking about figuring out your role in the story.  <br/><br/>Fiasco is so brilliantly themed because the fiction it mirrors rarely has one protagonist.  Like "Fargo" or "Shallow Grave".  <br/>I could write about Fiasco for awhile, but I'm not going to do that here.<br/><br/>So, players might start off with a Want, without know whether they were the Antagonist(Villian) or Protagonist(Hero).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450095/#Comment_450095" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T20:21:22+00:00" title="December 17, 2015  8:21PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>An interesting counter-question might be: how many games are there where these roles are actually of crucial importance to playing the game?

One of the things that's always surprised me in the game is how immediately and completely the players tend to assign roles to the characters at the end of the story. For instance, if someone has a certain goal, and fails, they often immediately are seen as the "villain" of the story (even if they were a likeable character up until then).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450103/#Comment_450103" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-18T15:28:33+00:00" title="December 18, 2015  3:28PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2015 3:28PM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember seeing a game played in the Inglorious Bastards movie. Can't remember the name of the game and haven't playet it myself. Players write down the name of a character (either fictional or real) on a card in secret, another player puts that card on his forehead in a way that everyone can see except him and then they start making one question about themselves to the rest of the players, in turns. The game ends whenever one player guesses correctly what character he is.<br/><br/>Now, think of a D&amp;D like one-shot where all players have a card on their forehead telling their race and class, but no character sheet. They will all have to play their way out of a 3 room dungeon and can try one "skill check", use a class ability or racial feature. The rest of the players just say if they fail or not based on the info they can se on the card , but not why. <br/><br/>Heh, ok, it would certainly need tons of adjustment, many race/class variables and players with an encyclopedic knowledge of those to be playable, but I think if could be cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450106/#Comment_450106" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-18T17:27:58+00:00" title="December 18, 2015  5:27PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds interesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450126/#Comment_450126" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-21T07:32:53+00:00" title="December 21, 2015  7:32AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever somebody played a character with a <i>mysterious past</i> that they didn't know about, this was interesting for character development.

However, having characters with unknown backgrounds or amnesia can give them a chance to change or redefine their loyalties.<br/>So can plots like 'falling in love with the enemy' or when a previous enemy offers their cooperation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450128/#Comment_450128" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-21T15:20:10+00:00" title="December 21, 2015  3:20PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally forgot that, I've had a few players with the amnesiac plot and it's the same feeling. The GM writes the PC's past and it's up to the player to find out. I remember a great friend of mine once GMed a resident evil like scenario, with all our characters trapped inside a mental asylum/military labs mix and no memory of who we were. We barely get out to be rescued by U.S. Marines and taken to a carrier. We're still unsure if that's good or bad for us, as we still hadn't much clues about who we were supposed to be.<br/><br/>Then, in an awesome plot twist, each of our characters turns out to be the leaders of secret underworld and powerful international factions. Like, a nuclear submarine surfaces right next to the carrier to pick up my character, who turns out to be the next fuhrer; my pal awakes in a cuban medical facility where he discovers he's the leader of a Templar order eight levels above Vatican authority. Then the last one awakes in an isolated tent on the desert and a friggin giantic helicarrier gets down to pick him and return him his command as the leader of a Shield-like organization. It was epically evil, we thought all the time we were civilians, while we had gathered there as evil plot masters to decide the fate of the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451116/#Comment_451116" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T18:22:54+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  6:22PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a move I'm working on for a fantasy game with a start-out-blank ethos:<br/><br/><b>Search your soul<br/></b>When you have a realization about yourself or the world, answer a question below or cross out a previous answer.
