If it was better written, it might say, actants are roles that depend on situations within a story. Or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNathan, I'm not a scholar or a student of narratology, but I can try to explain how I think actants work in the context of a story. Actants seem to be roles possessed by characters. These actants depends on their relationship to other characters' actants and the situation in which they are relating. For example, one character can manifest different actants as we see in the earliest Star Wars movie: Princess Leia is first an Object to be rescued, then a Helper during her escape (it's really more of an assisted escape than a rescue) and later becomes a Sender when she orders the attack on the Death Star.

Greimas understands actant to be the structural role within a story played by the character in a narrative (and so "actant" is a term of art within a narratological grammar); Latour understands an actant to be the product of binding together humans, objects, and texts in the real world (and so "actant" is an actor-network, a "cyborg" held together by various mechanisms of control).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MJGraham</cite>This comment was posted on my blog: "You are different with a gun in your hand; the gun is different with you holding it.

When you look at a character sheet, you can conceive of it as a network of properties and relations. What if they were all fundamentally contestable, either within the fiction or within the game?<br><br>In my notes, I have an idea for a science-fiction game based on Latourian sociology of science. It would be sub-titled "technoscientific space opera" and the point of play would be to create more potent and durable actor-networks involving your focal character; conflict would be a matter of accommodating the resistance of other actor-networks. The mechanics would thus involve "subverting" the elements on other character sheets and shoring up the ones on your own.<br><br>EDIT: Adam Dray's "Verge" actually instantiates this: you have no character sheet.

The intent was to take 'town creation' one step farther by making it public and the morality play much more explicit while ditching the genre. I playtested it a couple of times and it seemed to work okay but it had some glaring issues. These problems were from not recognizing that I was holding onto elements of design that had no place in this game. I had a few crazy revelations and found <i>Agora</i>. I stole a lot of stuff from it and left out the stuff I didn't like (also lots.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it is, it's a GM-less transhuman/poststructural game where character axioms are brought to bare and while squabbling over narrative resources. There are relational elements that are co-determined and lots of risk management.  It's effectively genre-less but it supports very well SF themes, I feel.

Imagine to walk in a forest without a GPS or a map? The map is not the forest but it is a material translation of it, enough to make you out of the forest, find gold, or a rare species (the legend is the function of the map, how it symbolises certain aspects of nature)  <br>\nMaps, theories, microscopes, flowcharts, structures etc. are hybrids (a mix of nature and culture, material world and knowledge), they put their mark in our lives, they affect us. <br>\n<br>\nThe concrete bridge is not just matter (we have hours of human work there, maps,imagination, ideology, dreams, computer programs...). The bridge can affect the dynamics of a city, circulation of people and cars (it plays this role in this network) but if you take the same bridge and you are studying the suicide rates, it can be a different actant, or affects humans in another way. The power the bridge has in a certain network, make it a more powerful actant, a less powerful actant or no actant at all.To know it, you have to follow the actant the way it is interesting to go in a network.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226802/#Comment_226802" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T14:16:13+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  2:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'all are giving me flashbacks to my "digging Umberto Eco's Semiotics texts" phase.

But you can do it a different way: Imagine a character sheet where the right to make or remove entries upon it was entirely contestable within the fiction of the game. Your concern in play is the strength and durability of the ties you create to the other pieces of your "actor-network," because you need them in order to get things done. But your nerves may fail you, your friends may betray you, your tools may break down, and your beliefs may lead you astray.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gabriel" title="Gabriel"><img alt="Gabriel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img1.orkut.com/images/small/1231257490/61868428/ln.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226971/#Comment_226971" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T19:10:46+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  7:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does this mean that characters and relationship maps are the same thing?

The actant is defined when you consider the position of other elements that can affect and be affected by the actant in the relationship map (network). So Levi-Who-Babbles, I think the character (actant) is not defined by the sum, but by the position. <br/>\n<br/>\nGuys, I\xb4m sorry, is very hard for me to write this stuff in English.
