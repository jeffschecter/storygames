The rules we're using are a hack that takes bits we like from Primetime Adventures, Rob Donahue's Wheel of Fate, Hot War, Minimus, and Amagi Games' Metasystem.<br/><br/>In the Ninth Division game I'll be playing a female android cop who works with a midget psychic gene-mod and an ex-military fixer type whose got an antique cybernetic eye. Thematically were looking to get into Blade Runner / Gattaca / Minority Report territory.</blockquote>\nWhat I really like is that we explicitly made this a retro-future styled on the 1940s, but they've still got very advanced things like androids, genetic engineering, and computers (although no internet).  One of my friend's made the argument that the science fiction that holds up the best is science fiction that draws from the past rather than desperately trying to imagine "The Future."  Anyway--that's what sparked the idea.<br/><br/>Here's the link to the setting document I posted over at my blog.  I'll talk about the characters in my next post.<br/><br/><a href="http://castledragonscar.blogspot.com/2009/06/9th-division-setting-document.html" rel="nofollow">9th Division Setting Document </a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213930/#Comment_213930" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T14:24:40+00:00" title="June 22, 2009  2:24PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!

between characters (similar to The Pool).  We initially formalized many of the systems in terms of things like scene framing, but we've found that we end up approaching a lot of this stuff intuitively once the game's underway.  <br/><br/>The document of our house rules used to be around seven pages, but I altered it to reflect what we were actually doing at the table and now its down to two pages--although I may continue to tweak it a bit more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214251/#Comment_214251" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T16:34:59+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  4:34PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of a cop who has been on the beat for so long no one can remember who he is. He blends with the office furniture. His corner of the precinct house is dark and smoky. No one asks about him except for the occasional rookie who gets reassigned soon after. His case files are all kept in stacks of old boxes which form a kind of wall around his desk. His is a world of stale cigarette smoke, coffee stains and an old weathered picture of a nameless dead girl whose killer was never found.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214289/#Comment_214289" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T22:41:07+00:00" title="June 24, 2009 10:41PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's exactly the vibe that we're looking for.  <br/><br/>We've discussed creating an oracle to use in-game to introduce setting/situation elements.
