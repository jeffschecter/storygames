                    So Ewen is in the middle of working on a somewhat surreal game for <i>Push 2</i> and, in the midst of thinking about it, something struck me.  Where are the RPG equivalents of abstract German board games, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_Bunny_Needs_a_Ham" rel="nofollow">Devil Bunny Needs a Ham</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari" rel="nofollow">Katamari Damacy</a>?<br/><br/>Traditionally, in many different games-based media, creators come up with neat things for the players to do and then generate a very arbitrary, colorful, and often downright strange reason why you should do it.  Take Mario for example.  He's a plumber who is rescuing the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom from a monstrous turtle monarch.  And he grows bigger when he eats mushrooms (like Alice) and shoots fire after plucking a flower that grows from a gold brick with a question mark on it.<br/><br/>This is almost a weird, twisted kind of "System Does Matter" in a way.  This is "Setting Is Totally Arbitrary And Irrelevant."  I'm not going to organize a formal design challenge or anything, but I think it'd be neat to try to design a pure system without any setting or color really specified and then arbitrarily tack on a shaky but amusing and memorable premise on top of it.<br/><br/>This would really break with the accepted approach to indie game design (and probably roleplaying design in general), where you take the premise and try to stay true to it, making your game system support your intentions.  In this case, you would have no real premise.  You would create some fun activities for the players to do together and duct tape a motivation to it.                </div>

                            That's interesting. Are we talking about a set of mechanics that are fun in themselves, so that the main pleasure comes from fiddling with them? I'm imagining something like Fastlane's roulette or Grey Ranks' board.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham, I don't think the fun necessarily needs to come from physical components.  The key is that the activities that make up play are enjoyable by themselves, devoid of any setting or character context.  Like, it's fun to move Mario around on the screen, break bricks with your head, and kill walking mushroom people.  It doesn't really matter why you're doing it.  So like, you could roll dice and have that move resources around or position pieces on a board or give you certain descriptive rights or whatever.  You could include any sort of game play techniques you want.<br/><br/>But the rules would be such that play would be enjoyable irregardless of any narrative content that you were generating, and the narrative content would probably be virtually nonsensical, as in "Okay, so Abraham Lincoln has slam dunked the pineapple into the colander."  The narrative content is not enjoyable by itself.  It is not a good story.  Narrative is not the point of play, just something tacked on for color.                        </div>

                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>I've played in games of Don't Rest Your Head which sort of touched on this, I think.<br/><br/>At Camp Nerdly 0, when we played, there was a lot of "Okay, I am now on the roof beating up models. Only, their heads are made out of TVs. So I'm totally going to use my Exhaustion Talent in this situation..."<br/><br/>It was part "let's tax the dice system, and fit narration around it", part "let's take it to wackytown", and part "screw internal consistency, let's just make shit up."<br/><br/>What we achieved was this bizarre story (more non-story, really) which involved really random elements being introduced, no logical consistency that I could see except for in the dice system...<br/><br/>Is this sort of what you're talking about?                        </div>

<p>Yeah, this is getting there, I think, but in D&amp;D-as-written, it's not overt. It occurs in play; one form of D&amp;D play involved designing characters that are optimized in outlandish ways to exploit funny interactions in the system. When you follow these characters into the world of description, you end up with (accidentally) bizarre things.</p>
<p>One example that comes to mind easily is the thri-kreen leaplomat - the thri-kreen race has a +30 bonus to the Jump skill (that turns out to not mean a whole lot because of the mechanice of Jump), which is not all that impressive, but if you combine this with the Exemplar prestige class (this class specialises in one skill, and can get various effects from making high skill checks), you get the Leaplomat.</p>
<p>The Leaplomat hinges around the Exemplar's ability to use its specialised skill as though it were Diplomacy. Since the scale of bonuses for Diplomacy isn't inflated like that of Jump, this means that the Leaplomat can make friends and influence people by jumping really high. Thus, we know that this is basically the way that all thri-kreen conduct diplomacy, because it's so efficient and effective, and one of the common assumptions of D&amp;D setting-derivation is that NPCs and society as a whole are conscious enough of their effectiveness to make close-to-optimal decisions as well as they can.</p>
<p>So, the process that's going on here is that the setting and in a broader sense the imaginative content of the game is derived from its mechanics rather than the other way round. In the Devil Bunny case, it's enough of a struggle to <em>find</em> content that fits the system, that we abandon the usual clinging to the content of the world, and run off into a kind of bizarro-world where sous-chefs are afraid of Barry Manilow and climb buildings in their spare time.</p>

When we start talking about Super Mario Bros., it helps to keep in mind that Shigeru Miyamoto was working with the technical limitations of the NES/Famicom hardware, and the storage limitations of the earlier NES carts to boot. Some of the weird things in the game were undoubtedly a response to, "This hardware is most efficient when we arrange things in blocks of this side. What can we do with blocks?" SMB happened to hit on a kind of gameplay that worked, and most of the core Mario games that followed were refinements of that gameplay, even when technology broke down the barriers that made it expedient in the first place. <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i> (the newest pure Mario game, for Nintendo DS) has a few twists here and there, but it's <i>very</i> much like the older SMB games.<br/><br/>Being more verbal and non-digital, the constraints in the medium of RPGs aren't nearly as severe, to the point where I'm not going to try to make a list of those constraints since someone will inevitably come up with exceptions that tear it to shreds. There are games that have neat stuff after the author said, "I want this game to use all six-sided dice," but it's not a "limitation" that you can't get around.<br/><br/>Wario Ware is a really neat game, by the way. It's a collection of tiny, tiny little minigames that you're subjected to at a spastic pace. The GameCube version has this crazy meta-game thing where the characters go to a doctor's office, and he'll say, "While yawning," or "While saying a tongue-twister," and after you do the mini-game the other players tap the A button to applaud you if you did it well. At the end, how well you did at the mini-games is pretty much ignored in favor of your applause count.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I think we are overlooking Capes. This is a game that is desgned to be fun to play. And the mechanics are center stage. while the setting is draped over in the same way that it is in a Super Mario or other "System First"video game.<br/>
