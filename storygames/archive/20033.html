Neat mechanic. Good ideas BUT not developed to its potential because of the desire to cram it onto two sides of paper and give it away.<br/><br/>This sort of thing annoys me a bit. This game deserves expansion, explanation, examples and artwork. Throw in some example characters and scenarios and you've got a better game and a great little book of 16-32 pages which you could probably sell for a couple of quid a pop.<br/><br/>Good games deserve respect. Most one page "pocket mods" are throwaway bilge and deserve the way they are treated. Occasionally, though, someone comes up with an idea that deserves to be more widely distributed and producing a decent, saleable, version helps with that. Lasers and Feelings is one of those IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443079/#Comment_443079" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T22:48:46+00:00" title="February 21, 2015 10:48PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I take it that the idea of "achieving minimalism" is not something that you've ever found to be particularly useful or particularly interesting?<br/><br/>Like haiku? You must take haiku. Limited number of syllables, very specific line structure \u2013 must be throw away bilge, right? Nothing of any use could possibly be the smallest possible kernel of distillation from which others are expected to gain inspiration, fascination, and motivation. That must be it.<br/><br/>That is, of course, the only possible position to take and all of those other people who say that they really enjoy it, have actually played it, and have experiences to share from other micro-games? Totally made up. Absolute bunk.<br/><br/>Or you <i>could</i> be an asshole.<br/><br/>Just putting it out there. Just exploring all the possibilities, which is something you seem to really want, a full expansion, explanation, and examples. Well, you provide a great example. I suppose I could expand at further length, but my own urge toward minimalism provides contraindication.<br/><br/>Personally, I think <b>Lasers and Feelings</b> is exactly the right length for what it is \u2013 a very minimalist, micro-system game which exists primarily to give people a couple of really good experiences and then provide them a basis on which to elaborate, explain, and expand in ways that exactly match their own vision, their own ideas, and sometimes in entirely different ways. Would all of those examples, elaborations, and expansions help with that? Probably not; if the last forty years of the RPG industry teaches us anything it's that a larger product tends to motivate less personal innovation.<br/><br/>But none of that could be true. All bunk. All crap. No one could possibly think differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443084/#Comment_443084" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-22T00:58:14+00:00" title="February 22, 2015 12:58AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i agree with you about RPG products becoming bloated. Eg, Steve Jackson games giving their authors a MINIMUM wordage for supplement whether that supplement requires it or not.<br/><br/>However, I also think that games can be hurt by having a MAXIMUM wordage applied. To me minimalism means throwing out anything you don't need. When play testing my first lightweight RPG (I'm a longtime author of trad big book RPGs) my players told me time after time after time about spurious systems I didn't need. The process was about pruning the game. In fact, I could fit the game onto a single side of Paper. (I've just uploaded a character sheet to RPGNOW which basically does that - meaning you don't need the rule book to play a game.) However, many people seem to appreciate all the extras in the rule book.<br/><br/>I'm glad L&amp;F in its current format works for you. I just think it would appeal to a wider audience with a bit of tweaking and is good enough to deserve that love.<br/><br/>We'll have to agree to disagree on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
