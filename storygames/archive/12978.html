It's an acknowledgement of the fact that the creation of story requires that you go back and reevaluate what you've done so far, and change it.<br/><br/>At first glance, this would appear not to be compatible with roleplaying games, but I got to thinking that this would totally be appropriate in a game where you wanted some surrealism. I love the notion of going back and changing what actually happened (without time travel) \u2014 something utterly bizarre \u2014 to "heal" story problems.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how this would be achieved necessarily, but it's the seed of something for me, I think.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292461/#Comment_292461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T06:28:21+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  6:28AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if a plot point system could be used to tag failures in the ongoing game and then those events could be changed in future play.

Now, if the bizarre elements you are going for is a feeling schizophrenia (I don't think this is the term I'm going for it is close) then it could work well. How far back you go in play might be a factor: changing an event from this play session vs from a session over a month ago would have a different feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm reminded of the third novel in the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. In that, the Gunslinger ends up going back in time and saving someone who was died from his point of view in the future. This created two sets of memories in the survivor that overlap. This is what I would imagine a player would feel when recalling the events, and this could then be realized and enacted by the character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if that is the best example, but multiple memories of the same event could create a sort of psychedelic feeling in a game. It might be a way of bringing to play stories similar to the movie 12 Monkeys (not the time traveling bit, but the corrupted memories that leave the protagonist questioning his reality).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to remember an example of actual play that would be appropriate, but can't come up with one at the moment. I'll chew on it for a bit and see what turns up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292463/#Comment_292463" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T06:40:47+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  6:40AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about a game that explore story width instead of story depth?

Ichi's masterswordsmanship is not reflected by having more attack bonus or hit points or whatever - the game is not a reality simulator.  So, simple.<br/><br/>The game's fiction (and rules) also suggest that there are people who are somehow ultra-aware of this and can manipulate the world without reservation. Ichi the Master Swordsman might have uncanny martial timing, but Ichi the Awakened Monster can actually tell you he's already killed you 5 minutes ago and it will <b>become</b> true.<br/><br/>In our game, the crew of a space ship ran afoul of the big bag corporate entity and spent a season's worth of gaming running away, looking for something to clear their identities.  Ultimately, they ended up on wasteland Earth, were they found rumors of some guy that could help them get their lives back.  What they assumed to be a master hacker or something turned out to be one of these "Anomaly" people who threatened to change what they had done to draw the ire of the company in the first place.  It was a very interesting game.<br/><br/>Now, it would seem as if this were a normal "Time Travel" situation - either the players get a replay on what happened, or they find that time is immutable, or that THEY were responsible for everything they thought was coincidence the first time around - but that's not how this game is playing out.  In the weeks before we met the Anomaly, we would spend each game following two plot lines - one that had the crew trying to find the guy that would clear their reps, and the other that would take one or two crew members and examine how the got to know each other.<br/><br/>It was surreal - these characters weren't heavily defined or developed before play, but as we played through what was going that week in either "timeline", it informed us of what had already happened.  One week they were at odds with each other because some crew members wanted to kill a prisoner and the others did not - the next week we discovered that the reason tempers were so high was because some of the crew members HAD BEEN prisoners themselves.  None of this was scripted or developed by a GM, the game forced us to fill in the gaps of WHY things were working out one way versus another, and in a surreal way it seemed as if the story was actually designed to accomplish this.<br/><br/>I suspect this comes from pareidolia (not Andrew Morris's game, but the phenomena) but it worked extremely well.  If I can bottle this shit, I'd make a mint.<br/><br/>- Frank Hablawi                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292468/#Comment_292468" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T06:54:42+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  6:54AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you remove the linearity of the narrative, in effect removing strict causation, players need to have something on which to base their decisions apart from their character's desires which tend to become meaningless under such circumstances. Under such "dream logic", I think things could work but I'm not sure what the status of conflict/task resolution would be.<br/><br/>That said, in our just finished game of Trail of Cthulhu I retconned the contents of some document so that the characters would have a reason to do something (travel in time actually). The reason wasn't apparent at first but the plot soon resolved as the players engaged with it without worrying about a solid justification, except that "the document explains it".<br/><br/>This isn't the first time we've done this in Trail games under development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292499/#Comment_292499" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:29:51+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:29AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game...<br/><br/><a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/recursive-tales-of-the-infinite-multiverse/" rel="nofollow">Recursive Tales of the Infinite Multiverse</a><br/><br/>...involves going back to any point in the story where something could have gone the other way and finding out what happens when if it does go the other way.

It was kind of like a retcon, except it took the form of a new piece of information people just didn't know before, and it fit into the story nicely.

In the end, I wanted to allow players to go back and edit things that have already happened in the narrative (the chat) using Wave's innate editing function.  Would these people be time travelers? will workers? gods?  Whatever the reason, some players would be able to tag things as focus points and other players would be able to try to veer these elements.  I think it's really the only worthwhile way of doing a game FOR Wave.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>-Frank Hablawi                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292509/#Comment_292509" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:52:26+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:52AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Considering Wave is dead, the coolness of your idea is tragic, Frank. I could totally see that working.<br/><br/>If I were to do this I would emphatically not want it to be a time travel story. Maybe a story of liars, who can lie so well they change the past. Really, though, what's key is the surrealism of it. Time travel doesn't necessarily feel surreal.<br/><br/>Steve's right, though. Without some way to ground people all their decisions are meaningless. In other words, this would need some serious game design behind it to make it a fun thing to do.<br/><br/>I think what I'm getting at here is consciously acknowledging that stories need revision. Allow yourself to be painted into a corner freely, then change what you need to so that the final story is cohesive if you look at it by stepping back and seeing what is "true" at the end. But I'd want to preserve the what-the-fuckery of having that change happen and having people be aware of it.<br/><br/>A thorny knot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ParticularlyEvil" title="ParticularlyEvil"><img alt="ParticularlyEvil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ParticularlyEvil">ParticularlyEvil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292524/#Comment_292524" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T09:28:15+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  9:28AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2010 9:30AM by ParticularlyEvil.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with you on the lack of desire to make this about time travel.  From the vibe I got in actual play, I think that we've all pretty much garnered a healthy idea of the various ways time travel stories work - so there really isn't anything special in seeing "revisions" expressed in this way.<br/><br/>So, putting that aside, I see two ways of allowing revisions in a game and acknowledging them.<br/><br/>1. Mulligan.<br/>We screwed up, forgot something, or just plan missed a chance to add a plot point earlier on.  Let's all be grownups and pretend that we didn't, ok?  So, maybe the Trail game Steve mentioned would be a good example of this.  That ancient text we got a few games back is actually full of plot-hooks that were previously untranslated or mistranslated.  I find this solution or use as pretty straight forward and not too exciting to talk about.  It's fine, of course, but pretty basic.<br/><br/>2. World in Flux.<br/>This is more of the meat of what we're possibly looking for - making the game be about the change.  The world is ever evolving and nothing remains forever as it had originally been recorded.  In my notes for my game, I had the players as Librarians guarding (and sometimes manipulating) the Scripts of Life, so they were the authors of their own and the world's history - and the conflict came when dark sorts worked to rewrite history in their favor.<br/><br/>I also really love the idea of using this to rework Barron Munchhausen; a game of storytelling liars where you can not only plant the seed of the next player's story, but you can modify what had happened as well.  I tried to work on this for a year, but I got stuck on the fact that the game just ended up feeling like a really fun improv routine - hence the refocus on Librarians and the nature of writing a good story.<br/><br/>Rob, I was slightly upset when I heard Wave was dropped... but I know that lots of its source code has been released as open source.  Oddly, maybe <b>now</b> is the time to actually attempt to develop for it...<br/><br/>- Frank Hablawi                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292548/#Comment_292548" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T10:06:45+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 10:06AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2010 10:07AM by lachek.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Compare one of my favourite movies of all time, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443536/" rel="nofollow">Hoodwinked</a> (or presumably a lot of the detective noir fiction it's based on, but I'm no expert on that). The narrative repeats four times, as retellings by the four protagonists, but they all have different stories of what happened from different points-of-views.<br/><br/>I've been thinking a bit about "do-overs" in RPGs in general. I've tried the technique a couple of times, in DRYH and Lacuna (both surreal games, of course), and I think there's a lot of mileage in the idea of playing something over again but making different choices.

And I mean that literally, interesting (i.e., not surprising, shocking, upsetting, etc.). I remember talking with you about <i><a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html" rel="nofollow">Primetime Adventures</a></i>, games, stories, and pitch sessions that time I ran it for you, so I know you to be interested in structure.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ParticularlyEvil</cite>Rob, I was slightly upset when I heard Wave was dropped... but I know that lots of its source code has been released as open source.  Oddly, maybe<b>now</b>is the time to actually attempt to develop for it...</blockquote>\nOo! I had forgotten that the Wave code was being released. That's very hopeful. Ideally you'd want to have a pair of lineages, the original events, then the events as changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292556/#Comment_292556" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T10:18:03+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 10:18AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an example!<br/><br/>When we played Trail of Cthulhu at Dragonmeet, someone went mad. When someone goes mad, you send them out of the room, and you all decide their madness, without them knowing. So, for example, you decide they've always been a Hobo. And when they come back in, they behave as if they're a doctor, but everyone else treats them like a hobo. It's fun.<br/><br/>Now, our game was originally set in 1930. When someone went mad, we decided that they only <i>thought</i> it was 1930. In fact, it was 1318. So, for the rest of the game, she talked about guns and cars, where everyone saw crossbows and horses.<br/><br/>It was surreal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ParticularlyEvil" title="ParticularlyEvil"><img alt="ParticularlyEvil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ParticularlyEvil">ParticularlyEvil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292569/#Comment_292569" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T10:29:28+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 10:29AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good idea with the duel lineages, Rob - and your dead on right, I love looking at story structure (plus this was an excellent change to finally start commenting around the site)<br/><br/>And I absolutely love that idea for Trail of Cthulhu.
