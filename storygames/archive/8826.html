We played out chapters 4-6. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Grey Ranks, the story weaves in and out of personal and mission scenes, which are under the place/time umbrella of Radio Lightning announcements that add big picture color to the individual stories of these child soldiers of The Uprising in Warsaw, 1944.<br/><br/>This is the story of a girl. There were other great stories at work in our game, but the other players can flesh those out if they feel so inclined \u2013 I know I won\u2019t be able to do them justice. My character \u201cNina\u201d was so influenced by the other players at the table, she felt like \u201cour character\u201d by the end. <br/><br/>Born Stephania Hoffman, the daughter of a working-class doctor in the Ochota district, \u201cNina\u2019s\u201d story begins when she is 17 \u2013 her last year in the Grey Ranks. She holds up the fa\xe7ade of maturity by her cool attitude and sometimes engaging in adult behaviors. Some of her peers find her boring, but she has nevertheless carved herself an important niche in the Grey Ranks with the medical knowledge she\u2019s gained from helping her father. The thing she holds most dear is her first love: Roman \u201cSlaz.\u201d He\u2019s also 17, and is a standoffish \u201cJames Dean\u201d bad boy, still holding hard to his faith. They\u2019ve not had much chance for a relationship, but she holds as a daily reminder and symbol a scrap of bandage from the time she dressed his wound some months back. <br/><b><br/>Part 1</b><br/>When we start, August 2, 1944, there is desperate street fighting going on in Warsaw, but spirits are high. Our characters, however, are all in dangerous positions on the Exhaustion/Enthusiasm &amp; Love/Hate axis. Nina begins in a field hospital. Slaz is there dealing with a ridiculous priest who is getting in the way of medical attention for the injured. Nina hopes to catch Slaz\u2019s eye and impress him by demonstrating her surgical finesse. But she\u2019s too distracted and ends up further injuring the poor man she\u2019s treating. <br/><br/>When she\u2019s found and given orders to take medical supplies to the front line, she ultimately accepts the suicide mission as a way to redeem herself. The ground is rough, however, and when shots come closer she trips spectacularly, sending the tools and bandages flying into the mud. Much of it is ruined. Her companions have little more success as they maneuver ammunition boxes to the front. Mucha, a sturdy kid out to prove himself, gets them past the German guardsman, but only with a bribe: a dented can of English marmalade \u2013 a special treat that Daisy and Nina were looking forward to, and their only food for the day.<br/><br/>By the end of the chapter, despite many personal failings, our characters have all moved away from the most dangerous locations on the axis grid \u2013 we might actually survive this!<br/><br/><b>Part 2</b><br/>August 4, 1944 \u2013 the fighting intensifies and this little squad of Grey Ranks have been assigned to free one of the refugees being forced to march in front of the German army. He is an important physiology professor (and an acquaintance of Nina\u2019s father). Sheepdog, a country boy, is in his element \u2013 he knows these woods that the army is moving through and he directs his companions to successfully sneak the professor away. A handful of other refugees follow, however, putting the entire mission in jeopardy.<br/><br/>Once free, they need a safe place to keep the professor and company, so Nina convinces the madam of a whorehouse to allow the refugees a bit of rest there. <br/><br/>On more personal levels, Nina is able to speak with the professor \u2013 he remembers her \u2013 and draw out some helpful information on the particulars of the German army.<br/><br/>At some point, there\u2019s a flashback with Nina and Daisy. They are standing outside the lecture hall where Nina\u2019s father is speaking. Daisy, 15, is trying to get Nina\u2019s friendship and respect. Daisy asks about Slaz, but she comes off wrong and then refuses the liquor Nina offers her. In the end, Nina sees Daisy as just another kid (and possibly a threat!) and tries to find a distraction that isn\u2019t there to take her away. <br/><br/>Slaz meets Nina in the park where they first met. It\u2019s now rubble. He\u2019s having a crisis of faith. She\u2019s brought him the Bible he left at the field hospital. They dance around their attraction for each other. They risk so much every day, but this feels so much greater. It is a passionate kiss - that never happens.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195332/#Comment_195332" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T16:24:00+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  4:24PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2009 4:27PM by EarthenForge.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Part 3</b><br/>August 7, 1944. The Home Army has been surprisingly successful, but things are looking grim for our protagonists. The safe house was found and destroyed, including those hiding there, and all of our characters are close to the corners on the grid. In fact, the Grey Ranks as a whole are in jeopardy. One of the highest-ranking officers betrayed the group and the result has been a chaotic power struggle between the Grey Ranks associated with the Communist People\u2019s Army, and those with the Home Army.<br/><br/>Daisy has stepped up in rank, taking on power she\u2019s too inexperienced to handle. Slaz has stepped up to responsibility as well \u2013 by taking up the slack from Anna Ostrowski, the Grey Ranks People\u2019s Army leader, who has become ineffectual in her morphine addiction. Sheepdog and Mucha are heavily involved in the powers struggle as well, and Sheepdog in particular is prepared to force peace by gunpoint, if necessary.<br/><br/>In a quite moment, Nina sits on a camp bed, back to the wall, in something of an exhausted stupor. She keeps replaying all of the failures over the last few days, including the professor\u2019s death and her inability to have a real relationship with Slaz. She draws her scalpel across her arm, making thin red lines. The pain is a welcome distraction. Daisy plops down on the bed, yammering away about her own life; completely oblivious to what Nina was doing. No one notices, in fact.<br/><br/>Later, Slaz and Nina meet up in the rubble park again. They\u2019re both in a pretty low place right now. He puts his arm around her and she just slumps into him. They carry the weight of each other\u2019s worlds for a few sweet moments. (This was my favorite scene!)<br/><br/>Later still, Nina is taken aside with orders for a very special mission. She is to find and assassinate the traitor. She comes upon him, large scalpel in hand, when he\u2019s sleeping, but she\u2019s too clumsy for this job. He wakes, grabs her hand and starts verbally berating her. <br/><br/>Then we have an interrupt flashback. Hours earlier, Sheepdog has gotten word of the intended assassination. He confronts Nina. She talks about duty, but he will have none of it. He knows and owns the Grey Ranks oath of fellowship better than anyone and assassination is NOT a part of it. But he becomes so sickened and outraged by her unwavering intention that he beats her.<br/><br/>Back to the assassination: Nina is still smarting from the bruises and angry at the humiliation that she\u2019s already been through. When her target grabs her, she just snaps. She kicks him to free her arm and stabs him again and again with her scalpel well past his dying breath. <br/> <br/>In the final scene, all the protagonists but Nina are gathered around a table angrily arguing for their side\u2019s control. Sheepdog has placed a gun on the table. Nina walks in, still covered in blood, failing to hide the scared little girl inside. This only escalates the fighting. Slaz can\u2019t convince her to join the People\u2019s Army. Daisy caps Sheepdog, and the hope for a united Grey Ranks crumbles. Slaz and Nina shortly thereafter commit suicide. None of them live to see their beloved Warsaw fall. Geeze, I get a knot in my stomach just from thinking about this story again.<br/><br/>So\u2026Total Party Kill! On a game level, we tried everything and destroyed all we held dear to keep a least one of us alive, but we all rolled so poorly it just didn\u2019t happen. (Dro informed me that this is a very true-to-Polish result!) Heartbreaking, but it was a really great game. I\u2019d love to play the full 10 chapters with even more layers and character development to explore. <br/><br/>If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, Jason recorded us at the end of the game talking about our characters. It starts at 1:30:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHKCb1QZT9E" rel="nofollow">Grey Ranks at Dreamation 2009</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195337/#Comment_195337" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T16:51:43+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  4:51PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2009 5:07PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: EarthenForge</cite>Slaz and Nina shortly thereafter commit suicide.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure how it played out in Nina's mind, but in Slaz's, he finally was able to get past his teenage bad-boy posturing long enough to open up to Nina (with that last scene in the park), only to see that he wasn't able to keep her from becoming hardened, destroying the sweet girl he loved but never said so to.  I don't think he actually turned the gun on himself, but more of a "suicide by cop"-style of ending, where he simply didn't feel he was worth the effort of self-protection.  Still a suicide, because that's what he "wanted."<br/><br/>Man, thinking about that and seeing my own reaction in the vid -- that's going down as one of my most favorite play sessions ever.  That has left a pleasant mark on my life as a gamer.\n<blockquote>Slaz meets Nina in the park where they first met. It\u2019s now rubble. He\u2019s having a crisis of faith. She\u2019s brought him the Bible he left at the field hospital. They dance around their attraction for each other. They risk so much every day, but this feels so much greater. It is a passionate kiss - that never happens.</blockquote>\nThere's a scene that happened in between that -- Slaz's first personal scene, where he's dealing with a crisis of faith, and attempting to maintain composure when Nina comes up to him in the coffee shop-type-place.  He failed, and there was a crack in his cold, bad-boy armor -- he put his book down, kissed Nina, and ran off, leaving his book there.  So there was a kiss!  But, not the sort that was shared, which I think is awesome.  In the way that gut-punching fictional tragedy is awesome, I guess. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Later, Slaz and Nina meet up in the rubble park again.

(This was my favorite scene!)</blockquote>\nAlso my favorite scene!  Though, that's because everyone worked up to that -- I loved how Jason helped with that scene between Daisy &amp; Nina about Slaz.\n<blockquote>My character \u201cNina\u201d was so influenced by the other players at the table, she felt like \u201cour character\u201d by the end.</blockquote>\nI feel similar.  I didn't feel like Slaz had his own story, but was a supporting character to everyone else (especially, of course, Nina).  I felt like Slaz was there to be someone to buck against Sheepdog, to be a target of admiration for Mucha, and later to challenge Daisy's sense of authority.  But, it could be because I felt less playing a character and more playing a web of relationships, at times.  Which I like (and I think where my instincts take me with this style of play).  Of course, playing the relationship between Nina &amp; Slaz was more prominent because of the elements involved.<br/><br/>Though, one subtle bit I put in that was purely internal I don't know how many others got:  he joined up with the Communist version of the Grey Ranks because he previously, as a result of destroying his faith, became a bitter atheist, and he took that next step that so many did to embracing the ideals of Communism.  (Though, the gamer-instinct was more of a "this needs to be owned by a PC and not an NPC, otherwise it's too external."  But that's upon thinking about it later and not in the moment.  Similar with leaving my book with Nina in the scene above, probably.)<br/><br/>But, yeah, I can't thank Jason enough for facilitating &amp; offering the game, and you, David &amp; Arturo for playing.  I want to play with all four of you again.  Seriously.<br/><br/>(If I recall right, Fred was talking about my "gut-punching emo porn afterglow" after that game.  I think I *still* have a bit of one.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195341/#Comment_195341" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T17:10:44+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  5:10PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading "Grey Ranks TPK" makes my heart hurt.<br/><br/>What's next?

She had no hope. Perhaps the worst tragedy at work behind everything were all the failed opportunities at human connection. Certainly between Nina and Slaz, but the two scenes between Nina and Daisy also come to mind. They needed each other but were too caught up in their own little worlds. It's a pretty sobering thought, really. (And I'm pretty sure this was happening to some degree with the other characters.)\n<blockquote><br/>There's a scene that happened in between that -- Slaz's first personal scene, where he's dealing with a crisis of faith, and attempting to maintain composure when Nina comes up to him in the coffee shop-type-place.

I knew I was missing a key scene in there. Nina was delighted to be kissed, but it was such a surreal experience, it seemed all wrong. That's what made the park scene all the more powerful - the timing was right, but the opportunity slipped by. So sad!\n<blockquote>I didn't feel like Slaz had his own story, but was a supporting character to everyone else...</blockquote>\nYeah, I think that's a big part of what this game does. Because you're framing scenes and playing NPCs for each other, as well as showing up together in mission and personal scenes, and even threatening each other's dearly held ideals, everyone really does have a part in your character, which is awesome. My only regret was not involving myself more with the other characters, but I think that would have happened if we'd had all 10 chapters.\n<blockquote><br/>But, yeah, I can't thank Jason enough for facilitating &amp; offering the game, and you, David &amp; Arturo for playing.

Slaz threw it down when Sheepdog said, "Fuck Poland."<br/><br/>What else can I add...<br/><br/>Sheepdog's "stick together" mandate seemed relatively flat at times, as I tried to shoehorn it into some scenes that didn't really call for it in a striking, emotional way (as opposed to the Nina-Slaz thing, which was consistently intense).  However, the highlight of the game for me was the one personal scene where Sheepdog proudly joins the Grey Ranks along with his older brother, only to be ditched at the last minute and told, "you're just a kid."  All the unity talk became suddenly powerful when Jason played my brother callously leaving me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195462/#Comment_195462" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T10:39:43+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 10:39AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2009 10:44AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was an interesting thing that happened at the end with the mass death:<br/><br/>Con game.  Tragic setup.  Flawed characters.  There ain't gonna be a follow-up session.  Single dramatic ending for everyone all at once, dying in a collapsing building?  Gold!<br/><br/>And yet, we still tried like hell to win, and given average luck on our die rolls, we would have healed the divided Grey Ranks and some of the characters would have made it out alive.<br/><br/>I think this speaks to three things:<br/><br/>1) The process of trying to win was itself fun.  This was the biggest thing for me.  "Come up with a way your character changes to earn a re-roll!"  Shit, why would I <i>not</i> max those out?<br/><br/>2) The situation as of the final scene was so fraught and full of interesting interpersonal dynamics, that pretty much <i>any</i> way it turned out would have been striking, possibly just as cool as the TPK.  "Let's roll dice and see what happens!" was fun in that context.<br/><br/>3) We got invested in our characters, and even though it was fun to see them crash and burn from a narrator's perspective, there was also some desire to see them achieve happiness or meaning or something positive.<br/><br/>I know this may read like, "Well, duh, of course, Dave, that's what's supposed to happen."  I just think this is a particularly interesting case of the intent coming to fruition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195465/#Comment_195465" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T10:57:40+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 10:57AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: really superb acting performances from everyone playing.

I don't know whether Grey Ranks inspired that during play, or simply attracted folks who were looking to contribute in that style from the get-go.  <br/><br/>Personally, I expected an intense game, and "vivid" is my favorite flavor of RPG intensity, so I was ready to get my acting on... and then in the very first scene, Rachel did a beatutiful lovesick teenager schtick, and everyone dug it, which I took to say, "Yep, it's on!"<br/><br/>It's funny, I'm used to leading the expressiveness charge in my home game, but here I felt like the bland guy.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195477/#Comment_195477" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T11:32:40+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 11:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple more thoughts, inspired by Dave and Arturo - just as a thought exercise, imagine if you had a couple more really important chapters after the ones we played.

A quiet room would have upped the intensity even more, and might have made it easier to further involve ourselves in all the stories. So...I'm thinking we should probably have a do-over.
