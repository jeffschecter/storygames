The players just take turns "requesting" scenes giving a focus, a location and an agenda.  <br/><br/>Don't over complicate the agenda.  It's just what the characters are "up to" on the surface, not what the whole scene is going to be about.<br/><br/>Not every scene must have a conflict.<br/><br/>Remember to keep Stakes limited to what the *character* wants out of the scene.<br/><br/>In addition to setting the Stakes specify what concrete action your character is taking to achieve them.<br/><br/>Do not include the consequences of success along with the Stakes.  Leave that up to the High Card player.<br/><br/>There are no "counter" Stakes in PtA.  Do not decide what will happen on failure before dealing cards.  Leave the consequences of failure unspecified and up to the High Card player.<br/><br/>Seriously.  These make PtA a so much simpler and easy game to play and deviating from them creates this really stressful and un-fun cold war-esq escalation in "narration grabbing."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194033/#Comment_194033" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T21:24:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  9:24PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, those are some great tips.<br/><br/>Although you're a bit far along for this, don't be afraid to say "NO WE ARE NOT DOING THAT" when pitching a piece of the game.

You will never, ever get out of brainstorming unless everyone lies or unless your group is some kind of magical story-game hive-mind.  "Everyone must be heavily engaged with the show premise" is a much easier target to hit, I think.  If only one or two people are passionate about the premise but everyone else is absolutely on board with it (able to riff off the genre and/or the setting, liking the characters and their issues, or whatever else it takes for them to be able to engage with the game), that's good enough.  Oh, and bonus points if the Producer is one of the "passionate" people.  Highly-engaged Producer = better game, always always always.<br/><br/>I love Jesse's suggestions, by the way.  I sort of wish my group had seen those before our ill-fated PTA experiments, but them's the breaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194061/#Comment_194061" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T04:04:27+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  4:04AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, PTA in chat, hmm.  I think I would throw most of the rules out the window, using mostly the basic scene framing structures, and freeform it for the most part, since that's generally way, way easier for online, text-based play, but it sounds like it's too late for that and maybe not what you're trying to do.<br/><br/>All the advice given above is great stuff, even the contradictory bits.  In my mind, one of the strongest tools in PTA is asking yourself: "If this was a badass TV show that I watched religiously, what would happen next?" and then trying to make that happen.  That's largely the purview of the Producer, but also useful when players are requesting scenes.  Pacing is really, really important, but it's not strictly structured by the mechanics necessarily, so you have to bring some of that on your own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michael.harrel" title="michael.harrel"><img alt="michael.harrel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michael.harrel">michael.harrel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194065/#Comment_194065" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T04:45:23+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  4:45AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group just finished the first season of our online PTA game, and spirits are high; everyone's been demanding that season 2 start as soon as possible.  We play over skype, with the text chat in-character and the voice chat out of character; it's a system that just seems to best work for our group.  When we started last year, I was the only one that had read Prime Time Adventures.  The first episode we tried to stick pretty close to the rules, but as the season progressed we started ignoring the ones that weren't working for us and focused more on the parts that were making it awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my group, that's meant loosening the way scene framing quite a bit.  We end up doing quite a bit of free form, as Jonathan mentioned.  We also had to hack the conflict resolution rules to work with dice, since those are easier to work with online.  We talk about what's happening, and should happen, and would happen on TV a lot in the voice chat, and that gets translated into the text chat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with any chat-based game, making bookkeeping as easy as possible for everyone is really helpful to keep things running smoothly.  This is probably doubly true if your group hasn't played the game beore.  We set up a wiki (cogs.wikidot.com) to keep track of everything we created in-game (it also houses the (slightly edited) in-character transcripts of the sessions).  We use the Skype interface to keep track of the fan mail cycle: The audience pool and the budget go in the title of the chat, along with a link to the dice roller we use.  Everyone's fan mail goes in their status bar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194069/#Comment_194069" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T05:59:54+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  5:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2009 10:01AM by Per_Fischer.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played two (5 episodes each) seasons using a basic text chat (die roller in separate channel) and it worked perfectly.

It ended up awesome, a couple of things we adjusted (that rally seemed to help) was:<br/>\n1) Producer prep - The producer was trying REAL hard. But what happened was, he front loaded the scenes to the point where they were almost hard coded, and then his effort sort of petered out in comparison as the scene progressed. So, we "felt" like we were being railroaded. But in fact, he was just doing strong scene framing. As soon as he came to scene framing with less prep, Producer participation evened out and we all had more fun.<br/>\n2) Time between scenes. Some of the players felt uncomfortable turning the clock forward. And that made scene framing and character participation awkward at times. Like, we wanted to see a scene with Bob and Steve, but Bob was all the way across town from Steve in the last scene.<br/>\n3) Issues - One of the players had a great Issue for our series, but he didn't communicate it to the group very well, so it didn't fire until the very end of the season. He picked Apathy. And on the surface, it seems like a "bad Issue." But what he really meant was, "Apathy is good, here, let me show you." Only know one "got that." So it laid fallow until he could show us...<br/>\n4) Conflict - We had interesting characters, but they were not setup with pre-existing, built-in conflict. So, we had to waste a lot of time building up those conflicts.<br/>\n5) Ensemble - We did not have an An ensemble cast. There were not many contact points between the characters. I was an academic, Sam had a Suit and Nate had a UPS driver. We didn't have an "organic" way to frame scenes together...<br/>\n  Well, I hope you can somehow learn from our mistakes...<br/>\n  Good luck!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194205/#Comment_194205" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T14:54:29+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  2:54PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Man, PTA in chat, hmm.

Germanic war photographer, with the issue:  duty to country vs. needs of self<br/><br/>Producer:  He's generally been pretty player-empowered in his approach.  Suggesting a scene is almost synonymous with becoming co-GM.  Also a goodly amount of co-GM feel came along when it was my spotlight episode.<br/><br/>Some Typical Problems:<br/><br/>* It feels like we have too many "I try to discover..." or "I try to figure out..." scenes, which are pretty lame anyway.<br/><br/>* We have scenes that are two people talking for way too long.<br/><br/>* The fanmail economy is there but only limping along.<br/><br/>* Most of the time I feel like I don't know what the episode is about, which gives me stress when it comes to scene-suggestion time.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks for all the suggestions so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195109/#Comment_195109" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T14:15:45+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  2:15PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Damn, I thought that I was the only one who came up with that step.</blockquote>\nNice try, Bohl <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/geiger/" rel="nofollow">Maybe next time.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195117/#Comment_195117" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T14:42:27+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  2:42PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, I'm looking at your premise and wondering...why would you try something that hard for a first time PTA game?  Especially one that's already going to have the challenge turned up a notch by being over chat.<br/><br/>PTA is about TV shows.  TV shows are not about bizarre niche extreme situations...usually.  TV shows are typically very familiar and very forumulaic.  PTA was designed specifically for TV shows that are very familiar and very formulaic...like Buffy, or Firefly.<br/><br/>When we played our show, "Eat at Joe's" was 2 parts Alice (you know the diner with Alice and Flo and Mel), 1 part Mayberry, and 1 part the Restaurant at the Edge of the Universe.  Sure, Joe's was a Truckstop on the edge of a Wormhole and several of the customers were aliens...but essentially, it was just a slightly more tragic version of standard old school sit com fare.<br/><br/>That made it easy.  We knew what characters were required to make it work, we knew what sort of issues were needed to make it work, and we knew what kind of pacing was needed to make it work.  Cuz the formula was familiar.<br/><br/>Don't use the pitch session to try and outdo each other on never before seen novelty.  PTA plays best when you're got a familiar formula to nudge you along.  Whether that formula is old family sitcoms, or buddy shows, or police procedural dramas, or kids growing up doesn't really matter, they can all work.  And if you put your family sitcom in space, or make your buddies robots, or have the kids fighting evil ninja on the side doesn't really matter either, that's just color.<br/><br/>But spies in 1910 Anarctica?!  I can't even begin to image what sort of formula that might follow.<br/><br/>PTA, IMO is not a "play anything" game.  Its a "play anything that you've already seen before on TV" game.  If you can't say "this show is like Lost crossed with the Prisoner and set on Mars" (or something) then its going to be hard to pull off in PTA.<br/><br/>(yes I know there are exceptions...but for first time play...I recommend sticking to the basics and saving the fringy stuff for later).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195144/#Comment_195144" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T15:31:38+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  3:31PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2009 3:32PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I strongly agree.

Suggesting a scene is almost synonymous with becoming co-GM.  Also a goodly amount of co-GM feel came along when it was my spotlight episode.<br/><br/>Some Typical Problems:<br/><br/>* It feels like we have too many "I try to discover..." or "I try to figure out..." scenes, which are pretty lame anyway.</blockquote>\nI'm wondering if these two things are related:  the worst part of our PTA games was that our Producer (who, I suspect, was both not-entirely-enthusiastic about the premise of the show and also trying to be very player-empowered in his approach) kept dropping the ball when it came to resolving scenes where the characters learned something.  His instinct was to throw it back on the players, letting conflicts like "I get the perp into the box and make him tell me what happened that night!" go through (a bad conflict in the first place, I think) and then trying to stick the high-card narrator with the job of saying what happened that night.  That did not go over well with our group, at all.<br/><br/>So when you say that your "I try to discover" scenes are lame, what's making them lame?  Is it that no one likes investigation to begin with, or is the problem coming from the results of the investigation being lame?  If it's the former, then you should be avoiding any premise relating to investigations; if it's the latter, then you need to figure out where the problem is and address that specifically.  And probably "I try to discover..." should never, ever be the central point of a conflict: like looking for clues in other games, if it's vital to the plot that the characters learn something, they should never have a chance to fail to learn it.  Make the conflict over what the character has to do in order to discover something instead, if you must have a conflict there at all...does he have to beat up a suspect?  Bribe a cop?  Let a guide fall into a crevasse?<br/><br/>A side note on the possible importance of a highly-invested Producer: our group loves investigations, but only if there's someone else (i.e. the GM) who will describe the results of that investigation.  Making up their own results is just no fun...so the less invested and more player-empowering our Producer got, the lamer and lamer our investigation-centered show got, and the less fun everyone had.  Eventually everyone stopped even trying to uncover any mysteries, because we had a strong sense that there was nothing there but an endlessly unsatisfying circle-jerk.  (Then we stopped doing action scenes, because those were unsatisfying, too.  Oh, it was a total disaster, really, hardly anything we liked in our games actually worked in PTA.)  Anyway, if we were going to try and go back and fix that problem and try to have our usual investigation-heavy story, I think we would've kicked the Producer in the ass and said, "The fans watching are the same ones who got burned by <i>Heroes</i> and the opening half of <i>Lost</i>'s third season, and they will not put up with your tired, aimless bullshit: they want to see that you have a PLAN for this show.  Either take the reins or we'll change the channel and never come back."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>* We have scenes that are two people talking for way too long.</blockquote>\nI can see how that would be a problem in a chat-based game.  Not sure how you'd fix it, except to try and sell the "this is a TV show!" aspect of the game to everyone, and remind them that TV conversations tend to be SHORT and TO THE POINT.<br/><br/>Mind you, the talking scenes were the only ones that ever actually worked in our group's PTA games.  Not surprising, since they were basically the same talking scenes we do in any game, regardless of the system, and therefore we weren't really touching any part of PTA when we did them.  Towards the end, we were just staying in those scenes as long as we could, because it was the only time we were having fun. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195258/#Comment_195258" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T07:44:34+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  7:44AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>Whoops; took me a little while to get back to this.

They're boring if there's no tension. Awesome story is the intersection of tension and immediacy. What sources of tension do you have? First the issues, then the outside stuff the Producer brings in. The story can't start out like okay, you're at sea and not a damn thing is happening. You need something to be wrong.<br/><br/>My first scene as a producer, maybe: Your boat has been sabotaged. Yeah. That puppy's going to sink, or you're going to be stranded, or some really similarly bad thing. That's outside influence. Now what about your issue of duty vs. self? You're ordered somehow to spy on your close crewmates. How far will you go to do that, when you have to rely on them to survive in the cold, etc? Now when you have scenes, they should address that tension somehow, and the outcome of each scene will tell you if that tension has gone up or down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195281/#Comment_195281" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T10:12:47+00:00" title="March  3, 2009 10:12AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly.

If there's not  a concrete way to effect the issue in the game, then I tell 'em to throw it out and come up with something more direct. Example: "I want to get my daughter off this doomed planet" gives me lots of little hooks to push the character around with. I can offer to let the character off the doomed planet (but not the daughter), I can imperil the daughter, I can have the price be ridiculously high (you'll have to betray all your friends). These are all things I, as Producer, can do to drive the character into difficult choices. By aggressively framing scenes around this core issue for whichever character is in the spotlight, I essentially have a car that never runs out of gas. (I realize this is significantly different from how PTA frames Issues)<br/><br/>Oh, and loosely define the relationships between all the PCs. Draw a relationship map if it will help (include major NPCs and nemeses). You will be able to very clearly see where a character needs to be hooked in to the others if that character is floating out at the edge of the map with a single connection with a '?' on it. This might counteract some of that feeling of emptiness the character sheet is giving you if you know that Bill is your friend and Sasha is your employer/lover. You can make this r-map right now without damaging anything you've established in the fiction.<br/><br/>(Most of this advice comes from running one-shots, but it'll work no matter what. However, you don't have to constantly press on someone's issue in a longer series, you've gotta let it breathe)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195453/#Comment_195453" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T10:13:28+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 10:13AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>I think there is value in talky scenes, if it is an establishing scene.

This holds double in PTA with its tight scene economy.

So, um...<br/><br/><em>Primetime Adventures</em>' scene economy is not as tight as, say, <em>Burning Empires</em>.  Or at least, it's not <em>made</em> as tight by the action of the game rules.  However, I find that whenever I play <em>PTA</em>, I end up with a pretty tight story.  There is always at least one thing happening in every scene, and often more than one.  There's a willingness to 'jump' forward to the next important scene, rather than spend time on 'traveling from where you were to where you want to be for the next important scene' sorts of scenes.  Cliffhangers, jump cuts, and surprise reveals are the order of the day, and keep the plot popping along quickly, with few "wasted" scenes.<br/><br/>As I've said, it's not the rules of <em>PTA</em> that make this so, but it is, I suspect, the central conceit of the game, "Make your own television show," that makes this happen.  Because players are familiar with 'how teevee works' they are far more amenable to hard scene framing, surprise reveals, cliffhangers, and what-have-you, because that's what happens on television.  The game really gets cracking when the protagonist players get the high card and start doing this themselves, rather than waiting on the producer.<br/><br/>It is amusing to watch television between episodes of a <em>PTA</em> season and start critiquing real shows based on the game's procedures.  Saying, "Oh, the producer totally dropped the ball in that scene, he could have thrown in more adversity" or "Check out that resolution, it was exactly what the character thought she wanted but turned horribly, terribly wrong."  And part of this, at least for me, is identifying the scenes that don't really work, that are essentially info-dumps or bits of required character interaction to set up something else later.  Once you realize (having played <em>PTA</em>) what you can do to make such a scene interesting, you are far less likely to put up with limp exposition scenes even in watching real television.  And then you notice that the shows that you really like don't have those limp scenes at all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195507/#Comment_195507" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T13:17:32+00:00" title="March  4, 2009  1:17PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very useful!

But there are also lots of "just talking" scenes in TV that rock. Some of those that suck have conflict and pressure and some of those that don't may seem to not have them. But if you watch, if you really follow along at a level just deeper than the surface, you'll start to see where all sorts of subtle things come out -- or where they fail. <br/><br/>(Deadwood, btw, was great for this. There'd be these scenes with Al talking to a dead Indian's head that rocked, and it was only if you really paid attention that you'd get what the crux of the scene was and why it worked. Then in the third season they got too distracted and distanced, and had a lot of lame-duck scenes.)<br/><br/>Its especially cool if you can do this, or at least talk about this, with folks you're gonna play PTA with. Using existing examples of scenes that do and don't do what you want -- hard examples that you've all seen and can YouTube for reference -- is a great way to work out a common vocabulary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
