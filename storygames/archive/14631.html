My concept is that the characters will get certain powers at the cost of permanently reducing their normal abilities like walking, talking, seeing, hearing, etc.  So a character's walking might be slowed to a shuffle, but she can now control some important system - or one might have their eyesight crippled to get a view of vital systems.  Obviously the stakes will need to be very high for characters to make trade-offs like this.  The point is that the players have to struggle in-character over how much their bodies and senses are worth.  <br/><br/>I'm not settled on what the setting and characters will be, though.  I think that it will be a science fiction setting, and characters are dealing with vital issues for their different nations.  Ideally, I'd like to setting to be familiar - possibly generic space opera or cyberpunk or possibly a popular TV series if it seems to fit.  <br/><br/>My question for brainstorming is:  What does this sound like to you?  Is there a familiar setting or scenario that is similar to this?  What kind of setting and/or characters might work well?  <br/><br/>The closest thing that comes to mind for me offhand is Geordi on Star Trek, but I'm still pondering it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332978/#Comment_332978" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T12:09:57+00:00" title="July  3, 2011 12:09PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2011 12:12PM by Graham.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like a Deus Ex setting to me.

There needs to be some crisis that leads to people wanting to make these tradeoffs right now, like the ship is in a degrading orbit and needs vital repairs. Then the crew can start sacrificing their cybernetic enhancements in order to repair key systems, or just to investigate what's going on. <br/><br/>Alternatively, nobody starts with cybernetics, but there's some source -- alien artifact, prototype cyberaugmentation lab, etc. -- that lets you trade your normal human capabilities for sub-standard cyberware equivalents. So everyone starts out fully human, but ends up much less so.<br/><br/>If you wanted a fantasy setting, you could have deals with the devil(s) along the same lines. Trade your speaking voice for the power to charm djinni, and there happens to be a fearsome one that's guarding the only exit. That sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332990/#Comment_332990" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T14:45:24+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  2:45PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>You might want to take a look at Joe Macdaldno's <em><a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/perfect/" rel="nofollow">Perfect, Unrevised</a></em>.

(You could have a real person play the captain, have a volunteer player, or simply have a computer logged into a gmail account which you can message from a smartphone at critical plot points.)  <br/><br/>I maintain that having a computer with a 30sec screensaver set up that someone must monitor is a great idea (could be life support, could be an alien ship, could be the reactor temperature, maybe the ship is recharging his pacemaker).  Then you can angle other players at that person and bad, bad things happen if the screensaver ever comes on  (set a password on the screensaver so there's no fibbing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333184/#Comment_333184" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T11:38:54+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 11:38AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story-wise, it sounds more like it would be geared toward a relatively small group going through a series of trials, rather than political nation interactions. Otherwise, I don't see the impetus to maim yourself being strong enough. There could be additional layers on top of that, but mostly I see it as a teamwork trial. Or possibly competing teams.<br/><br/>In fact, your post is giving me some ideas I might want to incorporate into a game I'm planning to run next year at WyrdCon. I want to do a game based on the TriWizard tournament from Harry Potter, with teams competing against each other with a combination of physical activities and puzzles. That sort of sacrifice-for-gain mechanic might be something interesting to add. <br/><br/>Like you could give a person dark red glasses that would help them read the color-hidden secret text (like the red-hidden decoders from McDonalds' prizes used to use a lot), but they have to wear the red glasses for the rest of the event, and some of the later puzzles involve colors (like differentiating between blue and green) and would be hard to solve with the glasses on.<br/><br/>As a suggestion, make it a short game if you are actually going to physically enact the sacrifices (blindfolds and limping and such). The more physical hardship you are asking your players to go through, the less time you want them to undergo that hardship. And keep the pace fast. If people are playing out hardship and the game is moving slow, they have too much time to think about the fact that they are physically uncomfortable for the sake of your game. They need to be heavily entertained so they don't get grumpy. Some, of course, will eat it up. But others will be more resistant.<br/><br/>And a suggestion about simulated limping. The best way I've found to make a rule for that is to make the player "wedding walk". They have to step with their feet together before taking a step forward. Step-together-step-together. It's tricky enough that, even though you can move quickly for a few steps, you can't keep up a fast pace of it for more than that. So it allows for a "panicked limp" when the player really wants to, but any person who isn't normaily impaired in their movement can easily outpace them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333190/#Comment_333190" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T11:55:46+00:00" title="July  5, 2011 11:55AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once played in a game where, as a quirky "special power", I had a walkie talke attached to my belt with an earphone placed in my ear. I was told not to speak in the walkie. It was tuned to the station the GMs were using to coordinate the game. So I was able to get some insight about what was going to happen.<br/><br/>But to add another wrinkle to it, this was a team-based line-course game. So there were other teams going before and after us. So I would hear about the GMs talking about the later team talking about encounters we had already been through, or about encounters near the end that the earlier team was going through.<br/><br/>It made for an interesting simulation of hearing aliens or gods, especially as I tried to interperet what I was hearing as much in character as I could. There were these people talking about things that obviously had to do with what was going on around me, but there was several layers of weirdness about the context that made it hard to interpret.<br/><br/>It was fun. And it's something you could maybe use - let someone wear sound-blocking headphones with a walkie speaker in them. So people have to talk really loud for them to hear. But you can feed them info though the walkie. And, if you want, you could let the listen to the GM channel.<br/><br/>I also played a game, years ago, where a similar thing happened. A GM put a walkie on me with an ear bud. But this time, it was the big bad guy of the game, talking in my head and trying to feed me bad thoughts. That was also fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
