The following are unedited text messages sent to Zac (also on these forums, though I can't recall the name) immediately following the game. I've excised Zac's responses, just in case he's not OK with me sharing them.\n<blockquote>Me: Monsterhearts is awesome. We're going to do more in 2 weeks. <br/>...<br/>Me: Interested in any skins? Buddha played a Ghoul and I was a Hollow. Think you can make it next time?<br/>...<br/>Me: Nice!<br/>...<br/>Me: Buddha turned on the leader of his cult in order to have a better chance of killing him.<br/>...<br/>Me: No, Buddha's ghoul was some kind of chosen one. Context: Buddha was clawing at his face and the leader was trying to strangle him.<br/>...<br/>Me: Buddha figured this would work because this was the first time the cultist had touched his creation, and he thought the leader liked strangling boys.<br/>Me: He was correct.<br/>...<br/>Me: Hollows are created beings, alive but not real.<br/>...<br/>Me: I was a blank slate, taking on the characteristics people projected on me and misunderstanding lots of human ques.<br/>...<br/>Me: *cues. I didn't explain how kissing my boyfriend felt empty very well and my friend thought I was date raped. She (through the gm offering me an xp) said I'd feel better if told a teacher "I was date raped" and I asked "just say the words?<br/>Me: Which I then did, though incredulously.<br/>...<br/>Me: Veruca said I should say Aaron date raped me, but I don't think that's true.<br/>...<br/>Me: It is the best AW hack! </blockquote>\nPlaying with Buddha and Joe is the highest-trust gaming environment I've ever had, and we let that trust and Joe Mcdaldno's rules take us crazy, crazy places and we loved it. Hope Mardock, my Hollow, was all over the map. I reflected back how other's behaved or projected on me: lovey-dovey with my boyfriend, violent and manipulative to turn the tables on cultist posing as a police to try to kill me, and playing the part of the victim afterward. My default state, though, was cheerful and disarmingly honest (which through the police Psychologist for a hell of a loop. "Dissociative" was definitely written in his notebook on me), though lacking the full context of what I said. Switching between that and "I want you to hurt me"/attempted suicide by cop darkest self mode was intense!<br/><br/>Hopefully this will lure my collaborators out so they can post some more substantive actual-play writing.<br/><br/>EDIT: Post 5 has the full transcript of our conversation!

We went to some straaange places.  Places I certainly was not expecting go, so I guess that's keeping the story feral for you.<br/><br/>(Apocalypse-Powered games practically run themselves, I think; it's definitely some of the easiest GMing I've ever done).<br/><br/>Our setup brought some unexpected things out of the players-- George, who I usually think of as the most sweet-natured member of our group, left a smoking trail of physical and social chaos in his character's wake, and Buddha, who was almost literally begging to play a dark vicious game for a change, did his utmost to resist the demands of his character's Darker Self and give everyone the endings they deserved.<br/><br/>I got one foot out the door, but I'll update with some personal highlights later.  Coming attractions: Hope and Leatherface under a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G; and why stabbing yourself in the brain is never a good idea even if you're POSITIVE you can survive it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370340/#Comment_370340" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-31T20:49:40+00:00" title="March 31, 2012  8:49PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tonight's session was a great continuation!<br/>And George, feel free to share my responses if you like ^___^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370773/#Comment_370773" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-02T17:30:50+00:00" title="April  2, 2012  5:30PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>Tonight's session was a great continuation!<br/>And George, feel free to share my responses if you like ^___^</blockquote>Here it goes!<br/><br/>Me: Monsterhearts is awesome.

Joe played Carla, Mortal who took some Infernal moves ASAP</blockquote>\nOh my god, never do this.  The Mortal is the killer app of Monsterhearts for me, a hilarious laying bare of the tremendous emotional unhealthiness that lurks at the center of oh so many trashy teen romance stories, and adding Infernal on top of that puts your character into a codependent relationship with both your Lover and Satan. Coupling the Mortal's masochistic neediness with the Infernal's blindness to long-term consequence is <i>explosive</i>.<br/><br/>(you should totally do this)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
