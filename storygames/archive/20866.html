I see that a remake exists as well, but I'm not familiar with that. I only discovered Rondo's existence last year, as the console it's on is practically non-existent here in Finland. It was a bit of a shock to discover that the best and most mature arcade-style Castlevania, that practically hones the form of the game to perfection, is one that I'd never even seen before.

That is, objectively <i>of course</i> there is a vast variety of games of all sorts out there, and it's an obscenely rich cultural field, because humans have been at it for decades, but that's not what it's about - the point in complaining about the monoculture of video games is that video games are <i>perceived</i> as repetitive schlock, because that's what the popular high profile games are. The games that get the most players, the most money, the most media attention. The point is that video games remain less than approachable because the mainstream of video gaming is what it is, even if there exist a lot of variety in the undergrowth that a casual gamer never sees.<br/><br/>Whatever one thinks of the idea of critiquing the medium for its mainstream, that same argument applies just as well to music ("the problem with modern music is that it's all superficial autotune trash for teenagers") or tabletop rpgs ("the problem with rpgs is that they're all D&amp;D") or anything else - or just as badly, were one to point out that nobody's forcing you to listen/watch/play that 70% of the field that exemplifies the current mainstream tastes, and that the real problem is not the medium or the scene, but rather the inherently mediocre cultural skills that limit humans to the mainstream in a world full of wonder and variety.<br/><br/>For the record, I think both viewpoints have merit; it's simply a legitimate complaint that a given media culture (consumers included) ends up elevating a mainstream that is less than perfectly virtuous - say by marginalizing women as hobbyists or by being so stupid I want to perform a self-lobotomy. It is always possible to do better, and the fact that somebody under a rock somewhere is doing better doesn't justify World of Warcraft - WoW needs to justify WoW, if it's going to, and if somebody cares to complain when it doesn't, I think that's just fine. It's not really my thing to complain about mainstream tastes, but I can see how it'd be important for a different sort of culture advocate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458815/#Comment_458815" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-23T23:22:57+00:00" title="December 23, 2016 11:22PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sorry, I disagree.

That is, objectively <i>of course</i> there is a vast variety of games of all sorts out there, and it's an obscenely rich cultural field, because humans have been at it for decades, but that's not what it's about - the point in complaining about the monoculture of video games is that video games are <i>perceived</i> as repetitive schlock, because that's what the popular high profile games are. The games that get the most players, the most money, the most media attention. The point is that video games remain less than approachable because the mainstream of video gaming is what it is, even if there exist a lot of variety in the undergrowth that a casual gamer never sees.<br/><br/>Whatever one thinks of the idea of critiquing the medium for its mainstream, that same argument applies just as well to music ("the problem with modern music is that it's all superficial autotune trash for teenagers") or tabletop rpgs ("the problem with rpgs is that they're all D&amp;D") or anything else - or just as badly, were one to point out that nobody's forcing you to listen/watch/play that 70% of the field that exemplifies the current mainstream tastes, and that the real problem is not the medium or the scene, but rather the inherently mediocre cultural skills that limit humans to the mainstream in a world full of wonder and variety.</blockquote>\nYou are right, the games I cited are far from representing the mainstream. Perhaps a better way to pu it is that, since Braid, there is a vigorous growing indie videogames industry, but its still that, indie and underground. When your average pal talks about videogames they cite Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, not Journey, Gone Home or Flowers. I stand corrected.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is a preconception among most non-gamer post-30 year old people I know that videogames are child things. Most of these people didn't have the opportunity (or interest) to sit down and experience a game that's not mainstream and no childish. So I think there is also a generational barrier involved too, which will break down eventually. (in fact, given my son and daughter and his pals interest in electronic media and games, I wouldn't be surprised the industry will reach cinema and literature respect and popularity in one or two decades from now).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458945/#Comment_458945" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-01T12:42:39+00:00" title="January  1, 2017 12:42PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2017 12:44PM by vini_lessa.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops.

We seem to have examples in this very thread.<br/><br/>True story: My wife always hated videogames. last month she saw me playing Dishonored 2 (a stealth-puzzle mainstream game) for just a moment and suddenly got invested in it, to the point of sitting down night in and out to watch me play through the end of it. Now she has already begun playing The Last Guardian with me, and even got emotional in a couple of scenes. So in a 13 years long relationship, just now she decided to sit down and enjoy some games with me. All due to a moment of sheer, unbiased curiosity. (let's see if I can do the same with RPGs <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>I agree with Eero that videogames on a mainstream level tend to be monolithically repetitive and formulaic/commercial, but there is also the factor of established preconceptions from non-gamers, who tend to keep turtled n these preconceptions and hardly give a chance to the media. Perhaps if the non-gamer or NUgamer crowd (in the case of my wife) entered the hobby in a significant way, we could see a healthy shift in the mainstream.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458950/#Comment_458950" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-01T19:15:53+00:00" title="January  1, 2017  7:15PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>And how many people who don't like videogames have actually sit down and gave an truthful chance to a game lately ?

It's also clear that the gaming mainstream does not do the hobby any favours by being, well, the mainstream - pretty man-childish, catering to a narrow band of tastes, commercially exploitative, and so on. Maybe I'm not far off the mark if I say that 50% of the bias against video games is out of entrenched ignorance (really, the muggle culture <i>loves</i> to perpetuate stupid stereotypes about gaming, it helps the middle-aged people feel relevant in a changing world), while the other half is because the gaming culture celebrates and focuses upon values that are, well, sort of dumb. In other words, gaming makes it <i>easy</i> to play it off as being beneath adult attention.<br/><br/>I mean, nobody could mistake me for a muggle (I'm using this term because talking about "the non-gamer mainstream" would just get confusing while also talking about the "gaming mainstream"), but <i><b>I</b></i> still think that modern mainstream video games are often pretty dumb - just think how easy it is to hold this opinion for someone who isn't intimately familiar with the form.<br/><br/>I think that it's been figured out pretty well what the casual gamer demographic (or "non-gamers", if you will) wants out of video games, though, so at this point it's just about building up the library - exactly as Vini says, the games are out there, and more are being made. But, just as has been observed, availability and noticeability is still pretty shitty. You basically have to be in the scene to find the gems (by whatever measure), and you're presumably only going to be in the scene out of habit (like say myself - if I didn't play videogames from a child, I probably would not have started in the 20s anymore), or because you already like the mainstream fare.<br/><br/>What I've been doing myself lately in the video gaming field sort of connects with this: I have my own tastes and opinions about interesting video games, so what I do is, I maintain my own private game console for my friends. A curated selection of games, perhaps with some commentary from me for cultural context, and just loan that thing out to them - you hold onto a copy of my console for  six months or a year, and odds are that you'll have some inkling of what I'm talking about the next time we talk video games. I especially like sharing my hobby in this form with people who don't play video games a lot, because it's a personal, low-commitment way to get to know my hobby - plus of course if you ask me, my game picks are the best, and therefore a reasonable person will obviously enjoy them more than some mainstream schlock <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>But that's just a grassroots approach to pulling attention towards interesting games. To get the scene to move in a wider way, video games need to go the same way e.g. Nordic rpg scene has: more women at all levels, genuine platforms for focusing on the facets of the hobby that interest you, and more variety in general. Anticommercialization (reversing the commercial focus of the artform, I mean) helps in a fundamental way on this, I think, because it helps more genuine artistic and human interests to surface - it becomes easier to perceive why one would engage with the hobby when more of its high-profile spokesmen are speaking for the art and from the heart, instead of for the latest bestseller,  from their wallets.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458993/#Comment_458993" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-04T18:59:32+00:00" title="January  4, 2017  6:59PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going back to the original link something that struck me as false was the claim that video games were more relevant to our current experience as a medium than say, the novel. <br/><br/>[quote]Meanwhile, our lives have changed radically compared to our parents' lives.

Some people will always prefer The Novel, for example, to any other medium. <br/><br/>Now that I really think about it, her blog post seems like the videogame version of asking why RPGs aren't more popular.

What might be going on with that, assumption-wise, is that many of us who engage with the form sort of see its possibilities in a deep way, often in a way that is yet to be entirely substantiated by practical products. Just like D&amp;D is merely a specific and often frivolous expression of the more general idea of [talk to each other to construct an imaginary space, then use this space to do stuff], historical video games may be viewed as developing towards the more general idea of [computer maintains an interactive space for you]. So when we just sort of assume that <i>of course</i> video games are for everybody, it's not "everybody should like Super Mario" - rather, it's "in the short-to-midterm future, practically everybody will come to use and appreciate tools and entertainment that are medium-wise essentially just video games - video games are for everybody, the medium is simply too powerful and basic in the information age for society to react in any other way".<br/><br/>From this perspective it is perhaps not unreasonable to simply believe that while rpgs clearly aren't for everybody, video games probably are, given time. I think I do believe so, for instance; rpgs inherently require skills and concentration much in excess of what can be reasonably expected from the average man (barring a really good motivation - it's not out of his reach, it's just not something he feels the need to do), while the barriers to using video games for entertainment and learning and whatever else are mainly cultural, requiring much less skill to engage with. Already, as our parents' generation gets sidelined culturally, basic proficiency in computer use is becoming a new norm, and with it comes a basic proficiency with game-like interactive systems. When it comes to video games as a medium, we are just starting to transition into an age of full literacy, so to speak; just like one could not have concluded that reading will only ever remain a rare hobby for the intelligentsia before the advent of universal literacy, one can't conclude that video games will remain a niche hobby before we see what it looks like when everybody gets used to engaging interactive virtual spaces. Build up the skills, and using the medium for mainstream art becomes much more feasible.<br/><br/>(Calling them "games" at that point - eh, likely not. The video game "Louvre Museum Experience 2019" won't have much of a game in it, it'd likely be described as "virtual tourism" - it actually is already. That still counts as a video game if we're talking about the inherent appeal of the medium - we can't just argue that video games are inherently unappealing, and then define everything that might appeal the mainstream to be "not a video game".)<br/><br/>Of course, all this might easily be a prophetic illusion brought about by nerd tunnel vision; people have the tendency to project their own experiences as universal, and the trends of their own life and immediate environs as applying to everybody over time. Even acknowledging that, though, I do have genuine difficulty to believe that using computers in ever-more complex ways is not a dominant trend for jobs and entertainment in the developed world, and to me that implies an era of video games, even if not under that name. For the cultural history to develop otherwise would be like if a civilization invented writing and taught everybody to write, yet writing fictional stories for art would remain a marginal subculture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459000/#Comment_459000" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-05T02:37:27+00:00" title="January  5, 2017  2:37AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe we can't reclassify anything that "might appeal to the mainstream" as "not a video game" but I think there's still a difference between "Simulated virtual environments" and "Video games" in the same way there's a difference between roleplaying as part of, say, a work training excercise, and an RPG.   While our definition of "game" is historically pretty messy, I don't think many people will argue that games are generally engaged with for enjoyment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
