But now, we're getting close to the point where I am capable of designing and finding an audience (however small) for any game I am capable of imagining, which is just flat-out insane.  That's not so much about developing our abilities as expanding our minds as far as what games can be, but I have faith that the techniques aren't that far behind.<br/><br/>Sounds like it could be a new thread though, like:<br/><br/>1. What game/concept are you not yet capable of designing, but might be in 10 years? What's beyond the current edge of the possible?<br/>2.

It takes a lot of work on implementation to bring theory into reality, however, especially when the components you have to prototype from are flawed human beings. That's why Vincent can draw clouds and boxes all day long but actually have to spend measurable time refining the techniques that will eventually create a game which profits off his theories. Once that game is released it takes people playing it for a while to figure out how that technique really works, how to really make it shine in play, and how to use it in other designs.<br/><br/>So while it's nice that we can all evolve our brains very quickly by hanging out on design forums and chat all day long (ha!), we still have to recognize that in order for the final products to evolve we have to put in a lot of blood, sweat and tears, and even <i>still</i> we have to wait for the <i>players</i> to catch on to the ideas. Not altogether dissimilar from user interface design - we might have good ideas, backed up by the academics, but it still takes endless focus groups to bring a product to market and then frequently years for the general public to warm up to it.<br/><br/>I think Matthijs' estimate of 100 years is not far off the mark.<br/><br/>(sometimes I cynically wonder how much of the "awesome story-game effect" is actually caused by following procedures of play and how much is reliant on being privy to the highfalutin' theory discussions surrounding them, resulting in a kind of small-scale faith healing / mass hysteria effect where people <i>think</i> they've experienced something profound when they really just sat around a table and rolled some dice. compare post-modernist academia, if you will.)<br/><br/>Matthijs, I'd be interested in hearing how much of the end-result in that game-100-years-hence you think will result from subtle "emergent" gameplay properties (and therefore, in a sense, trick the participants into creating something incredible rather than something mediocre) and how much will be due to the actual hard work and effort of the players, perhaps in accordance with the rules of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247139/#Comment_247139" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T13:11:55+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  1:11PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You want me to predict the future, with my little brain?

How about the opposite: I want games with greater complexity and greater player awareness of the procedures, choices and consequences that go into playing the game. Subtlety is indistinguishable from non-awareness, and therefore I want games that are taken more seriously, which is reflected by more elaborate ritualization of the game space, which in turn heightens the experience and allows the players to focus more fully on the structural web that is the game they play. In a 100 years we'll be playing games that are more complex than anything we're playing now, with more awareness of our roles as players, and the responsibilities this causes us towards one another. There will most definitely be game designers, and they will be considered artists of the highest caliber for their works that sketch out models that communicate truths about every facet of life.<br/><br/>I guess that'd be "structuralist game design" or something.

Again, there's a key concept here (\u53e4) the past before anything was structured.<br/><br/>You'll have to go outside of Le Guin for this, but conflate Taoism and Zen is like conflating, I dunno.

What does "greatness" even mean? How would imposing such an ulterior agenda change the experience? The implication is that you can accuse somone of "failing the game" if they don't touch their inner-being over the course of play.

I can see the reasoning behind the reading, but the "empty mind / full belly" statement is more generally taken to be an admonishment for leaders to keep their thoughts on the basics rather can getting preoccupied with institutional dogma.
