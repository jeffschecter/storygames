At the time this wasn't the central point of the arguments, but given a bit of time I'm still very happy with the text and my experiences with it have been very positive.  Here's my take:<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age is not written like a textbook; it's written as a conversation.  The text takes more than one read.  At 32 half-legal pages, practically a pamphlet - if it's all done in one pass then that's one damned expensive pamphlet.<br/><br/>As a reader, if you approach it like it's a procedural document, or a textbook, or like other games you've got on your shelf, you're going to miss the beauty of the text.  If you leaf through it, pick it over, and re-read it, then you'll see the conversation - and it's very tightly packed.  The first read gets you into play; after that, the text (i.e. continued conversation) improves that play.<br/><br/>The major criticism I've seen leveled is that you only can go halfway to the full game experience with a straight, single read through of the nook.  If you do that, play just one session, and don't come back to the text, you'll end up disappointed.  I don't think this is because the text is flawed, but because the ideal play for the game is very specific.  Getting from any given starting point (indie, trad, neophyte) to that fine-tuned play isn't something you can really expect to do in a single session.  But over multiple sessions, you go back to the conversation in the text and bam - there's dozens of things that help you refine your play.  The mechanical procedures are only part of what the game is.  As you return to it, the game tells you how to tighten up your conflicts, improve your scene framing, establish and vary your rhythm, and know how to spot resolution.  Doing that right with In A Wicked Age's mechanics isn't something that's going to happen instantly - it will happen if you play, return to the text, and really absorb how it relates to what you did at the table.  The text is an extended conversation with Vincent about both how to play In A Wicked Age, and how to play it extremely well.<br/><br/>If that means that instead of returning to the text, you went to the internet, that's OK, but you're missing out.  For me, the text has supported that conversation better than the internet browsing did.  If enough people play the game and post about it, that might reverse, but again, the text gets you into play, and then helps you improve that play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139437/#Comment_139437" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T17:34:37+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  5:34PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2008 5:35PM by DainXB.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, I completely agree.  Unlike a lot of people, I didn't have much trouble figuring out how the game was supposed to be played from reading the text -- and I like the way the text is presented, as well.  The 'author voice' that Vincent used for <i>IaWA</i> lends focus to the flavor of the game.  It's very different from the 'chatty' style he used for <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, and I think that may have thrown off some of his fans.  The writing in <i>IaWA</i> is very spare, very lean.  In <i>Dogs</i>, Vincent tells you how to do something, then tells you why you should.  In <i>IaWA</i>, he just tells you how.  The 'designers notes' aren't there in the running text -- they aren't there at all.  It may or may not be intentional on his part, but I think that style lends the text some of the atmosphere of the less-introspective, more visceral-action 'wicked age':  Characters in a wicked age don't examine their motivations, they <i>act</i> on their drives and desires!  That style of writing also cuts down on the word count, page count, and production costs, which I believe were conscious considerations by Vincent for this project.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>That having been said, I did have some misunderstandings about the mechanics, where things were not explained clearly enough.  In order to create that spare, focused textual style, Vincent leaves some things unsaid, and sometimes I jumped to different conclusions than the ones I was supposed to jump to.  That's where the Internet helped out a lot:  Here in various threads, and on the Lumpley forum at the Forge, Vincent answered my questions and got my though processes lined up with his intentions.<br/><br/>Some examples:  <br/>I initially thought that returning NPCs carried over their damage the way PCs do.  They don't:  the GM alwasys assigns their full dice at the start of any chapter when they appear.<br/>I initially thought that a character could use more than one Particular Strength for a roll.  They cannot -- and there's a good design reason for that, once Vincent explained it.<br/>I initially though that it was possible to strike off more than one appearance on the Owe List for advantage dice for one conflict.  It isn't -- for much the same reason.  <br/>I didn't have any trouble with advantage dice in multi-person conflict, but many people did, all based on one phrase in the rules, where it says 'pass the advantage die'.  That implied to many people that in multi-person conflicts, there is still only one advantage die to be gained from successes.  Nope; everyone who gained advantage gets a die, and no one ever has a different total against one opponent than against another.<br/>There was also some confusion about what constituted 'having bigger dice' when there were three dice on one side and two on the other.  Vincent provided the 'persnickety rule for bigger dice':  When the biggest die of the two die set is bigger than the biggest die of the three die set, if the two die set 'surrounds' the three die set, (meaning that the biggest is bigger and the smallest is smaller), then the three die set is bigger.  If the sizes 'overlap', then the two die set is bigger.<br/><br/>In most of these cases, jumping to the wrong conclusion about what the rules meant won't break the game (at least not for a while), but it's always nice for me to know that I'm playing the game the way the author plays it himself.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I've compiled a set of Vincent's quotes from the various Q &amp; A threads, and keep a printout in the back of my rulebook.  It's a quick-and-dirty FAQ for the game until an official one becomes available.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139438/#Comment_139438" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T17:51:58+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  5:51PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you have a copy of the FAQ?

I don't like humiliated for the Wicked Age, so didn't include it, but it's an official option in the larger ruleset.<br/><i>-- Vincent</i><br/><br/><b>NPCs</b><br/>NPCs can recur if the Oracle brings them in again.  In the rules, "The unwitting husband of a serpent-demoness" comes up and is grabbed by Mekha's player as describing Mekha in that chapter. If no player picks a particular suggested character role, the GM could do the same thing to an NPC in order to bring that NPC back.  "The unwitting husband of a serpent-demoness is your former mentor from Chapter One, Tullius!"  <br/><br/>No NPC can ever have a particular strength of greater significance than 2, because NPCs do not go through the advancement process.

For purposes of who goes on the owe list, d12 d10 +advantage counts as d18 d10.<br/><i>-- Vincent</i><br/><br/><b>Particular Strengths Significance</b><br/>An increase in a particular strength's significance is specific to the character who increases it, and new characters starting with Chapter 3 can have either existing or newly-made particular strengths of significance 2.  But occasionally you'll have a particular strength where, because of how it's defined and described, if it gets bumped up for one person it OBVIOUSLY gets bumped up for everyone who has it. In those cases, go with what's obvious. If my character has a PStr of "the dog-spirit guards my life", and someone else has the same PStr and it's noted as the same dog-spirit, then it should be upgraded for both (the dogspirit leveled), but otherwise no.<br/><i>-- Vincent (&amp; others)</i><br/><br/><b>Particular Strengths</b><br/>Q: Far Reaching, p.20:  The example uses exorcism and spirits, so the core aspect of this Strength being something you could "not normally inflict" is about not normally "in the fiction" (e.g., in this fiction spirits are not normally affected by mundane actions) as opposed to not normally "in the rules"?  It doesn't let you do something the rules say you can't do otherwise (e.g., come into a conflict the rules say you are out of).<br/>A: Yes. A nice, easy example is a network of spies and agents - it's far-reaching because you can act through it in places that you aren't. Notice that if a demon goes to possess someone, they both totally roll dice over it, but someone standing nearby doesn't. With exorcism, someone standing nearby does get to roll dice - just like with a network of spies and agents you get to roll dice in a fight on a city street even though your character is up in her palace.<br/><br/>Q: Does defining a Far Reaching strength effectively mean also indirectly defining an aspect of the game reality.  Without Exorcism defined as ability to counter possession, which you otherwise can't, it's not clear that anyone couldn't try to drive out a spirit.  Defining something as Far Reaching is a way of saying, "in this game, you can only do that thing with a Strength that says so".<br/>A: I wouldn't recommend that you draw any attention to this in play. It just happens, no need to attend to it.<br/><br/>Q: Possession itself as a form of attack by a spirit seems a candidate for a Strength, with the Far Reaching benefit since "taking control of another" in that way would usually be "beyond what you can normally inflict".<br/>A: The corresponding subtlety here is that, by not making it a particular strength, we've established that it's something that spirits can normally do. Again, I wouldn't pay any explicit attention to this in play, just go with it.<br/><i>-- Vincent</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139480/#Comment_139480" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T06:12:55+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  6:12AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Rolling Dice In Conflicts</b><br/>Q: As I understand it once you've chosen forms for a conflict you are locked in.  Does the same go for Particular Strengths? If I think of a way to bring in my P.Str halfway through a conflict can I roll it for the latter rounds?<br/>A: By default, you roll the same dice forward, with the winner of the last round adding an advantage die in this next round. If you want to do something else, you have to both agree to it - and either of you can end negotiation simply by demanding the default.<br/>If you're like, "hey, instead of rolling this advantage die, how about I bring in my exorcism?" I'll be like "sure," every time. Easy - no particular strength is as good as an advantage die. But if you're like, "hey, in addition to rolling this advantage die, how about I also bring in my exorcism?" I'll be like, "pff. No."<br/>Or maybe I'll be like, "okay, but I'm switching to directly with violence," and you'll be like, "sure," and so that's what we'll do.<br/><i>-- Vincent</i><br/><br/><b>Advantage Dice </b><br/>Q: Is it correct that after the first exchange in an action sequence (when awarding of owe list is made), you can strike your name from owe list in that same action sequence to use in the 2rd and 3rd exchanges (if it goes that far)? <br/>A:  Yes.<br/><br/>Q: Suppose A is challenged in round 1 by B. A wins and and gains an advantage. Now C challenges A in the same round. Does A get his recently won advantage die to add to the roll, and if not, why?<br/>A: No. Roll the advantage die you won this round at the beginning of next round, not before. (I waffled a lot about this rule, but there it is.)<br/><br/>Q: Suppose A wins the challenge from C and gains an advantage. In round 2, does A get two advantage dice, since he won the the advantage twice in the previous round?<br/>A: No. You can have only one advantage die from winning.<br/><br/>Q: Can you strike multiple entries of your character's name from the We Owe list to give yourself multiple advantage dice for a roll?<br/>A: No, just one.<br/><br/>Q: Advantage dice gained by using the We Owe list last until the end of the conflict, but what about those gained from winning the advantage?<br/>A: One round only. But, like, if you won the advantage again, you don't have to throw the die back in the bowl and fish it out again, you can just hang onto it.<br/><br/>Q: Imagine a sword fight. In round 1, A gets an advantage over B, B gets no advantage, C gets an advantage over A.  In round 2, does A count her advantage die against B, but not against C? <br/>A: When you roll an advantage die, add it to your highest die. It doesn't matter who you're comparing it with - A never has a different roll vs B than she does vs C.  (In the sword fight, A and C both roll advantage dice in round 2.  Imagine for instance that A is using her advantage over B to keep B between her and C. She doesn't have the advantage over C, but she can use her advantage over B to neutralize C's advantage over her.)<br/><i>-- Vincent (&amp; others)</i><br/><br/><b>Consequential Damage to NPC Forms</b><br/>Q: When a particular strength is consequential vs an NPC form, Do we lower the highest dice? Do we lower both dice? Does the victor chose which dice to lower? <br/>A: A consequential particular strength will reduce one die in that form. The book doesn't specify, but it'd be most consistent with the rest of the rules for the winner to choose which die.<br/><i>-- Vincent</i><br/><br/><b>Persnickety Rule for Determining Bigger Dice</b><br/>For 3-dice vs 3-dice, compare high dice, 2nd dice break ties, 3rd dice break ties.<br/>Want persnickety 3-dice vs 2-dice rules for who's rolling bigger dice?<br/>This rule is only for when the biggest of the three is smaller than the biggest of the two. d12 d6 d4 is obviously bigger than d10 d8.<br/>If the two dice *surround* the three dice, the three dice are bigger. Examples: d12 d4 -vs- d10 d10 d6; d10 d6 -vs- d8 d8 d8. The three dice are bigger than the two dice.<br/>If the two dice and the three dice *overlap*, the two dice are bigger. Examples: d12 d10 -vs- d10 d10 d10; d10 d8 -vs- d10 d6 d4. Believe it or not, the two dice are bigger than the three dice.<br/>(Also, I'm not 100% that this rule is correct for every single possible case. However, when it's wrong, the two sets of dice will be for all practical purposes equal. Example: is d10 d8 really bigger dice than d10 d6 d6? Maybe it's not, I didn't check. However, either way, it's within a point or two of 50-50, so who cares.)<br/><i>-- Vincent</i><br/><br/><b>Terminology</b><br/>I wish I'd called them action sequences, formally and explicitly.

But from my POV, they serve as a means to clarify what a rule means, if/when the rule is not clear in the text. Where the writer uses them as the sole means of clarifying what a rule does, requiring that the examples be read, it annoys the living crap out of me. Reading that text literally made my brain hurt. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's really bad about using examples to eludidate the rules is that often they say "Not X" which is to say that they do not clarify "Y is true." It could be, but we're not sure. Or the opposite problem. As an example it can only clarify the portion of the rule use that works for the situation in question. So, again, good as clarification if there's a question from the main rule. But doesn't tell you anything about the general case. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that for a relatively simple game, the number of clarifications that have been neccessary come about precisely because of the use of examples as the primary way of trying to describe how the rules work. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have another question about how the rules work, but I'm going to go see if it's been posted on elsewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139628/#Comment_139628" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T13:12:37+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  1:12PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too disagree with the opening post. the game is great, the rules as rules are terrible.

I thought that Dogs was one of the best straightforward rule sets I had read and played. but IAWA was confusing due to the "example problem" discussed just-above by Mike H. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would not be so frustrated if the game was more complex, but as simple as IAWA is, it could have been much better written, conversational style or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe game itself is beautiful, but there was consistently so much confusion and even now after three or four games i am not satisfied that I have a few things worked out. I am no editor, I do allot of technical writing, and am still struggling with creating good text for explaining complex issues (I am an engineer). and it was not just play that created problems (as in where during play you discover issues not covered in the text that you thought were clear), but reading it alone, I new there were lots of holes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love Vincent's games, but I wince when I sugest IAWA to my friends because I know that I canont defend the text choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike many others, I have tried to write my own games, and text rules are hard to write. but Vincent is a past-master, and should have been willing to give us poor readers more guidance than he did. The examples are not good explainers since they never go into detaisl about the many and various permutations that you might have. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want more rules, I just what to understand the rules I have. <br/>\n_____<br/>\nJason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139675/#Comment_139675" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T21:23:14+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  9:23PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

I'm saying that characterizing it that way, as if that's the default mode of play, is non-sensical. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we played at ForgeCon, people were like, "is he going to cross his name off the list? Oh... one-shot... of course he will..." And this statement was made indicating that the people felt it was problematic. That (or any of the other small problems we had playing) didn't stop it from being enjoyable. But it's obviously not what the game is designed for. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I think that what Bret was really indicating was more that it can be played on the spur of the moment, which is absolutely true.

Sorry if my writing wasn't as precise as neccessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecap:<br/>\nBret: It's my fave one-shot.<br/>\nSubtext: this is it's best use. (Note that we may have misread the meaning, this is just the subtext that occurs to us). <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid: Don't let Vincent hear that!<br/>\nSubtext: Vincent has heard this claimed, and disagrees strongly. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike: I can't see how it's a one-shot at all. <br/>\nSubtext: I agree with Vincent that it's being categorized this way wrongly, given what it does support. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fear is that, in fact, nobody will play it long-term, not realizing it's potential for that sort of play. We don't need anyone to confirm that it plays well as a one-shot, that's become a well-known fact. We have to convince people that this is not it's sole use, or even it's best use, even if it's a good use. <br/>\n<br/>\nInSpectres suffers from this problem in spades, for instance. I think that it has been almost 100% relegated to one-shot play, when, in fact, some of it's best properties are distinctly and neccessarily missed by such play. So, again, forgive me if I'm a tad touchy on this subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nJD, cool, I could see that happening.

But I also think that, as in the play that I encountered, it's quite natural to quit between chapters.

I remember a checklist (still a bit touchy-feely but not too bad) for when a chapter is over, is there such a thing for stories?

Thing is that I'm pretty sure that's not the only issue. Again, knowing Vincent and his designs, I'm assuming that there's a lot of emergent stuff that goes on. And you'd still be missing that. I used the example I did because it's the one thing that I could see clearly from the precisely one session of play that I've experienced. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could be wrong... that could be the only issue. I'll leave it to those who have played more sessions to comment further. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if the game is a demo, that's a neccessary part of play, that it be only one session, and your fix will help for that one session. But I doubt that replacing the reward will completely make up for any missed parts of play after one session. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJD, yeah, we do "Complete" stories for Universalis in only three scenes, sometimes. Short stories, to be sure, but there's no definitive length. And I'm not saying that there's no neccessity to play more than one session... heck, if you play for 12 hours, you'd better damn well finish it... my point is that for people who play shorter sessions, and who might see (as we did) a natural cut-off at the end of chapters, they're the ones who might be missing out if they only play one. I think one is definitely too short, and I think three is pushing it. Five I could see for sure, thought. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, that's all highly speculative. And I'm making assumptions about what Vincent thinks, too. And perhaps even projecting some about InSpectres. But just hoping that the game gets the love it should for the sort of play it best supports (in addition to whatever other things we do with it). Whatever that happens to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140370/#Comment_140370" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T12:30:59+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 12:30PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Mark... that's a good fix for that one problem.</blockquote>\nI agree.

I even thought specifically about what type of story I'd want to pursue next with the character, even though I knew it wouldn't happen.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how the others at the table felt because, frankly, I was the only one who made the We Owe List.  Perhaps it wasn't a driving motivation for them because they were just learning the game, or perhaps they didn't feel it was important because this was obviously going to be a one-shot.  It's impossible for me to say.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Daniel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140653/#Comment_140653" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T08:44:32+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  8:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2008 8:54AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha, a typo created a pretty hilarious discussion/disagreement.<br/><br/>I mean't PICK-UP game, not one-shot game. Whoops. It's definitely a game for multi-session play. My brain was just in a different location.
