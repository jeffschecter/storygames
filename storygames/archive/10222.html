I wanted to get some thoughts on these games from folks that are interested in these kinds of games (in other words, no dismissive side-talking if you haven't read the thing; just the facts), and had a chance to glance at them.<br/><br/>To my knowledge, the following games came out:<br/><br/><b>Rogue Trader</b> - Merchant princes in the Warhammer 40k setting.<br/><br/><b>Eclipse Phase</b> - Transhumanist fighty action-RPG. <br/><br/><b>Earthdawn 3rd Edition</b> - The third edition of this classic game.<br/><br/><b>Septimus</b> - Bill Coffin's Everything-SF RPG<br/><br/><b>Geist </b>- The latest from White Wolf, sort of a nWoD retake of Wraith, from what I hear.<br/><br/><b>Pathfinder</b> - Also described as "Dungeons and Dragons 3.75". Huge release at GC.<br/><br/><b>FantasyCraft</b> - Apparently another competitor with the D&amp;D 3.X crowd/Pathfinder.<br/><br/>(I might be forgetting 1-2 other major releases. And Eoris doesn't count until it's actually OUT).<br/><br/>If you've seen one or more of the above, or have any thoughts, hit up the thread. Especially if anything really caught you as cool re the setting, rules.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227069/#Comment_227069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T06:08:25+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  6:08AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's all of what I know based on listening and in some cases flipping through books:<br/><br/><b>Eclipse Phase</b> - Adam Jury did the layout for this thing, so it's literally only a matter of time before I get my hands on this book. The setting seems to be an action-y Greg Egan-verse Lite game. Lots of percentile crunch, skill lists, etc.<br/><br/><b>Earthdawn 3rd Edition</b> - I'm interested in hearing what direction they took for the internal art. However, all I know about 3e is that they fixed some of the step ranks so that higher skill/step ranks have less randomness (that is, took out the d4/d20s from the chart). Otherwise, sounds like little has changed rule-wise.<br/><br/><b>Pathfinder</b> - Seems a pretty solid release. I flipped through it at the store, it's pretty much 3e back to front, no surprises. Packs a lot of punch, which is why it seems a solid release for the folks who want to stay with the 3e release strain and feel that their game is not "dead". Great art, too, though mostly taken from previous Pathfinder supplements.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227070/#Comment_227070" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T06:08:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  6:08AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I didn't know Rogue Trader was actually released.<br/>Who released Earthdawn 3ed?

It has some interesting differences to 3.x. And probably some things that I <i>think</i> are interesting differences which may, in fact, be exactly the same. I find it mildly interesting how much, with games this complex, a group's actual play experience will drift from the actual rules as written.<br/><br/>At any rate, I'm quite happy with "PFRPG" and also quite happy with their adventure path series; I will be most certainly playing this game for years to come because of the really good quality canned adventure/campaign material--a lot of the people I play this game with really appreciate the more traditional, simulationy, gamey approach to rolegames, and the narrative approach not so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227085/#Comment_227085" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T06:57:01+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  6:57AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Geist </b>- I played the demo at Origins with Matt Mcfarland. As usual, while it seems to have a lot of good ideas, the White Wolf system doesn't allow the use of any of your cool powerz to any cool consequences. <br/><br/>The basic idea (and I've never played Wraith) is that you play a person who was about to die, but whom a dead spirit decides to revive just before you do (re: Louis in interview with the vampire "I'm going to give you the choice I never had). The catch is that the spirit then inhabits your body, and is always in your thoughts, making you a composite of two personalities. It seems like that's just Roleplaying fluff though, because it has no mechanical affect other than the color of having that spirit there, and it giving you your powers. It may or may not speak to you.<br/><br/>You have Keys that are the power associated with your chosen Geist splat. You also have Rituals that are associated with your splat as well (as i recall, there's lots of powers that you get) that lets you do different things with the dead. My character could release souls that wandered around in purgatory, but only if I knew who I was finding in purgatory, had a personal affect of theirs, traveled to the proper plane of reality (through these special doors that are everywhere) and THEN did the ritual. Most of the powers seemed to work in this roundabout way.<br/><br/>It was a neat concept overall, but not really too innovative. I don't think I'll buy it. I still think the new Changeling is the best NWOD game, to give you a sense of my taste, of course if you remove the fact that the Keepers are basically child abusers. I pretty much ignore that when I play, and if I would run it.<br/><br/>Now you all know my secret: yes, I kinda like the WOD.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227091/#Comment_227091" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T07:16:00+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  7:16AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick aside!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Now you all know my secret: yes, I kinda like the WOD.</blockquote>\nThere is no shame in this!

Mostly, I can't sometimes help returning to my roots, back when I was 16 with purple hair and black lipstick and reading all about neo-paganism and thinking vampires were the shit. I get nostalgic. *sigh* <br/><br/>Back on topic, though, has anyone played <b>Eclipse Phase</b> yet? My husband read a review of it online (rpgnet maybe?) and the person reviewing it pretty much said its ubercrunch. Has something like 100 skills, and focuses heavily on them as a mechanic. They arise from your characters planet of origin. So, if you come from "Mining Planet X" you know how to mine things and drive mining vehicles. Yick. We were mostly disappointed by the fact that the most interesting part of this setting - the Transhumanist ability to change "shells" and port your mind wherever - was merely color, and in fact didn't seem to have much if any impact on the game whatsoever. Anyone heard different? I was kinda excited about this before I heard about those two facts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tork" title="tork"><img alt="tork" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tork">tork</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227117/#Comment_227117" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T07:49:26+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  7:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>If anyone has picked up Rogue Trader, I would love to hear about it.</blockquote>\nOne of the members of my regular group picked it up, and we will probably be playing it on the opposite weeks from my Earthdawn campaign.  I haven't really had an opportunity to look it over, but from talking to my friend about it a bit, it doesn't sound like it's too significantly changed mechanically from DH, though the power level is much higher.  One thing I thought was interesting is that profit motive has been hardcoded into the rules.  It's also interesting that the default play style entails one player being the Rogue Trader, master of the ship, with some degree of authority over the other characters.  (They moderate this by making each character master of their area of expertise, limiting the trader's authority to dictate how a particular task falling under that area of expertise will be accomplished.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227119/#Comment_227119" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T07:55:40+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  7:55AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got a chance to flip through PFRPG when I was buying Pandemic.<br/><br/>It's large, packed full of text, has a decent, but not exciting layout, quality art, the writing is clear, and it looks well organized.

I've not played Spycraft, so the innovations I recognized are probably in there. There's a cool modular NPC creation system to make the fantasy monster you've dreamed up by picking off some tables. There's interesting social classes, and a neat feat system to make your species a subspecies, like you're not just a dwarf, you're a <b>mountain</b> dwarf.<br/><br/>It looks (from the preview) and sounds (from reports) like D&amp;D 3 all clean and shiny and with fresh ideas. I really liked D&amp;D 3 (not sure why, but I didn't like D&amp;D 3.5 as much) and so it's intriguing me.

It has Endeavors, which are kinda macro-scale level skill checks (form colony, etc) that allows for a framework of having a massive crew, but that's about it.  <br/><br/>The combat rules are for party-level play.  The GM advice clearly notes that the PCs will be the ones doing stuff since they're the capable people.<br/><br/>The game makes much more sense if your ship has a much, much, smaller crew- a hundred or so, perhaps.

The ships could be crewed effectively enough to sail (though not fight) with 75% losses or more.  The origins of the naval tradition of Spit and Polish came about because the navy needed SOMETHING for all these blokes to do before they died off.  So where the army could be continually occupied by marching and setting up camps, the sailors were kept occupied by holy stoning the deck and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect the 40K universe just took Age of Sail-esque crew numbers and grossed them up 10-100 fold for ships that are 10-100x bigger.  So to bring some rationalization to things you can probably assume that at any given moment any such ship is substantially under that ideal level of crew especially if they've been in space for an extended period of time.  Plus, IIRC, 40K ship weapons take large crews to man (like Age of Sail guns) so most of the manpower can't really be assigned to other duties without leaving the ship unable to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill pretty silly, but then the 40K universe was always 2 parts awesome 1 part overthe top silly anyway...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227218/#Comment_227218" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T11:49:33+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 11:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Hey man, I've heard very little about this other than it's a competitor product to Pathfinder.

My husband read a review of it online (rpgnet maybe?) and the person reviewing it pretty much said its ubercrunch. Has something like 100 skills, and focuses heavily on them as a mechanic. They arise from your characters planet of origin. So, if you come from "Mining Planet X" you know how to mine things and drive mining vehicles. Yick. We were mostly disappointed by the fact that the most interesting part of this setting - the Transhumanist ability to change "shells" and port your mind wherever - was merely color, and in fact didn't seem to have much if any impact on the game whatsoever. Anyone heard different? I was kinda excited about this before I heard about those two facts.</blockquote>\nHey, I'm Rob Boyle, one of the co-creators of EP. I wouldn't describe it as ubercrunch, more like moderate crunch. It's not really much more complicated than say, CoC/BRP. Character creation is probably the crunchiest part, but we have 16 ready-to-play sample characters provided, and I've had no problem explaining the rules to people and getting them started in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>Characters are skill-based, and there are in fact 49 skills on the skill list, though some of these are field skills that are used more than once for different focuses (Academics: Archeology and Academics: Biology, for example). Skills are chosen mostly free-form at character creation, though your background and faction give you specific skill bonuses.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why you you heard that resleeving (changing shells) is just color, because it's a major component of the game. Your morph (body) is customizable and affects your skills and ablities, and resleeving can be mentally traumatic though it provides functional immortality. <br/><br/>From a storytelling perspective, Eclipse Phase has a lot to offer in terms of setting, background material, character options, and campaign opportunities. How does your uplifted raven character get along wearing the shell of a flightless clanky robot? How does your character cope with the fact that they were resleeved from a backup but lost 6 months of their life? How would a party composed entirely of forks (copies) of the same character in different morphs get along? How does your character justify airlocking a kid who was infected with an alien virus, in order to save the millions he might have spread it to? <br/><br/>Another core component of EP is a reputation mechanic. Each character participates in various social networks, and your Rep score in these networks affects your ability to get information, acquire favors, etc. Rep can be gained and lost in game based on your PCs actions. In a major part of the setting, reputation has replaced money as the basis for the economy, since nanofabrication allows everyone to make anything they need. In these areas, wealth is meaningless, but being creative, helpful, and cool count.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's just a start. The PDF of the game is now out, released under a Creative Commons license. The hardcopy won't be in stores for a lil while yet, as it's still being shipped from overseas.

The Rogue Trader concept appeals to me more than anything else in that universe for role-playing. I'm definitely in the target market. <br/><br/>What's interesting about Rogue Trader? The Age of Sail comparison that Ralph made is very apt. Also, in Rogue Trader, you really are playing a titan of the universe. You have a relative degree of freedom in an oppressive universe that's on the scale of one person in tens of billions. You can meet and interact with aliens. You can talk to a High Inquisitor as a sort of equal. You're able to explore and plumb the mysteries of the universe.<br/> In the 40k universe, the real stuff is done by individuals. The horrific evil is defeated because someone went in and chopped its head off with a chainsword. The mystery is solved because someone grabbed it by the throat and commanded it to cough up its secrets. That's why, even though you have a crew of 100,000 (yeah, that number is excessive), you're still the guy (or girl) that does the important stuff. Your entourage (the other PCs) are similarly unique and empowered individuals. There's also an incredibly rich field for interplay between these characters. The potential for exploration of character relationships and the color of the 40k universe is huge. Between your characters and the people (and Things) you can interact with, you can really go practically anywhere in the milieu (and it's a huge milieu).<br/><br/>Isn't that awesome? The real question is: does the game deliver? Unfortunately, it was sold out before I got to the booth at Gen Con. I did pick up their promo pack, complete with introductory adventure. It's a pretty cool, moody encounter on a derelict battleship in a sort of space Sargasso. Unfortunately, at every point in the adventure where you might interact with an interesting NPC, the adventure specifically instructs the GM exactly how to avoid that interaction and keep the players on the railroad. It's a very discouraging glimpse of what the designers see as the kind of play Rogue Trader will support. The sample characters don\u2019t click with me. They feel like very generic sci-fi goons picked straight out of central casting. Well, the Rogue Trader guy himself is pretty cool, but I\u2019m not convinced.<br/><br/>This matches my assessment of Dark Heresy. Sure, it has long lists of weapons and skills, but I don't see that it's really a vehicle to explore the setting the way I want to explore it. I still hold out hopes of being surprised by Rogue Trader when the book shows up at my local game store, but I'm not expecting it. I bought Starblazer Adventures instead. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll happily eat my words right here on SG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227821/#Comment_227821" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T08:04:28+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  8:04AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main reason Geist is not like Wraith is because the biggest obstacle in Wraith was that you couldn't affect the material world.

"incoherant" is a poor word to use, probably. I always have a process of selecting the stuff that I think is cool, then sometimes having to fill in little gaps to bridge over the stuff that I'm never gonna use in play.

Like, say, from here: <a href="http://www.cargo-culture.net/Eclipse%20Phase/CAT21000_EclipsePhase.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.cargo-culture.net/Eclipse Phase/CAT21000_EclipsePhase.pdf</a><br/><br/>Which seems to me to be a way to go. I rarely run games that are big (say, bigger than 30 pages or so) off a .pdf. So if I know for sure I'm going to play and enjoy a game, I'll buy the hardcopy. <br/><br/>Even if the hardcopy is pretty damn expensive. So for all those companies charging $70 for their big hard cover shiny works of art -- no problem. Not so long as I can get a free .pdf first to see if I like it or not. If I do, if you're really sure about it, then I'll buy your massive book for your large price.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228010/#Comment_228010" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T16:35:32+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  4:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eclipse Phase, Diaspora, and Septimus are really scratching that Sci-Fi itch I have had of late - an itch that tuned out to be...itchier...than I has first assumed.<br/><br/>Eclipse Phase is lovely.  I bought the PDF and it is so. very. pretty.<br/><br/>Diaspora is also an attractive package, but in a different way.  Lulu did a good printing job with it, it is the right size to tote, and the content is groovy as hell.  This is a toolkit for awesomeness - IN SPAAAACE!!!!  It's layout, font, and introduction pulls you aside and whispers conspiratorially, "we both know that a new-fangled, hard sci-fi version of Traveller would rock ass, but how about we also let you have some creative input as well?"  Well, the only answer for that is "Yes, sir!"<br/><br/>Septimus is, as of now, mostly promise - it looks good (seems like a theme here), but with EP seducing my eyes and Diaposra tickling my brain, it will have to wait.<br/><br/>The good news for Sci-Fi fans is that you can throw the ideas from all three in a blender and pour the result into the rules of the one you most prefer.  These are sources that seem to be able to play very well with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228096/#Comment_228096" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T07:32:06+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  7:32AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the link Brand!<br/><br/>Those are indeed some pretty digital illustrations, as Judd has pointed out, in Eclipse Phase. Space Octopus? Creepy doll girl? Hand feet? This looks like a nice catchall setting for all those sci-fi settings I wish I could play simultaneously (Aeon Flux, Ghost in the Shell, Event Horizon, Mass Effect, Battlestar Galactica, just to name a few). Art gets a thumbs up. <br/><br/>Still wary about 402 pages!

Not a huge amount of crunch or anything....less than Gurps 4th, certainly... but it's pretty standard fare.  The fluff, though, is awesome and there's a ton of great ideas in there.  Basically... you're transhumanists who fight crime.  The idea in this game was to give some kind of actual play framework that Gurps Transhuman Space didn't elucidate all that well.  Overall, there's a bit more sci-fi flash and chrome (aliens, 'stargates', psi powers) to remind you that you're playing a cool-ass game setting and not a bunch of dry cultural essays (and THS felt like that all too often).<br/><br/>Pathfinder is gorgeous...but to be sure it's D&amp;D 3.75.  If you never liked 3x, this won't remedy anything.  As I've tired of the 4e experience (from last year already), Pathfinder calls to me in sinful, sandbox-play ways.<br/><br/>Fantasycraft is scary as fuck.  It's D&amp;D retuned to Spycraft mix 'n match flavor which is a good thing but it's a book of crunch with a lot of eccentricities (which is the maybe-bad thing for me).  Not as complex as Spycraft 2.0 which means mastery of the game requires years and not decades of play.<br/><br/>Septimus -- a whole ton of decent fluff that misses the mark.  Not nearly as 'exploration friendly' as Ringworld was back in the day.  Basically, they carve out some bad guys that are the common enemy for PCs which makes it all that much more mundane and familiar.  I read Septimus with interest.  I read Chaosium's Ringworld with awe. (Comparing the two because both are massive space constructs in space opera-ish universes)<br/><br/>Diaspora -- huge thumbs up and excellent form factor.  I love Starblazer Adventures but the size is retarded.  Diaspora is something you can carry without losing the use of both knees.<br/><br/>Rogue Trader -- haven't seen and not looking forward to it.  The WH40k universe feels like a satire rather than cool the way I want it to be.  Hopefully it'll be much cooler in person.<br/><br/>Geist = eh.  Werewolf and Changeling remain the only nWoD game lines that really felt reinvented and awesome to play.  Wraith which was crazy dark in that emo way and I never cared for it looked thematically richer than Geist does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228321/#Comment_228321" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T00:35:08+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 12:35AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2009 2:47AM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My problem with EP is that they took a whole lot of different SF (Macleod, Stross, Sterling, Doctorow, Morgan, Brin and Simmons seem to be the main influences) and smashed it all together like some sort of laser-shark mash-up; one of the pregens is an octopus with an arc-welder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main 'techs' (Drexlerian nano-tech, memetics and Computational Theory of Mind) have all been proved to be untrue/impossible/if-we-can-do-that-then-we-can-do-more-awesome-things.

We haven't really played it enough to say if I like it better than just the base game, but it definitely adds, IMO.  The New Caprica stuff gives a major shift to gameplay at the end, but I kinda like that.  One of the weak points of the base game is the end mechanic; you can often tell who is going to win before it happens.  It may turn out to be the same when we're familiar with it after more play, but for now, it's a good shift.<br/><br/>It's also relatively easy to play without the expansion elements without having to remake the decks, because all the new cards have a Pegasus icon.<br/><br/>One thing for sure, the Cylon Leader cards with their secret (but always mixed) win conditions are a distinct improvement over the Sympathiser.<br/><br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10222/2009-gencon-big-releases-rogue-trader-eclipse-phase-etc-thoughts" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10222/2009-gencon-big-releases-rogue-trader-eclipse-phase-etc-thoughts" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10222/2009-gencon-big-releases-rogue-trader-eclipse-phase-etc-thoughts/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10222%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10222%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
