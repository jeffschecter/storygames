As a jumping-off point, however, we're creating a world-building, story-telling game, Barsoomian Chronicles. It uses as its basis Microscope combined with Dawn of Worlds and Diaspora.<br/><br/>The aim is for the group to collaborate on a history of Barsoom (or a region thereof) in order to have a better handle on the world and genre before adventuring in it. But for you story-gaming aficianados, is there anything you'd like to see or not see in something like that? Or is that too broad a question...?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448788/#Comment_448788" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-28T14:20:12+00:00" title="September 28, 2015  2:20PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2015 2:20PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd start by looking at the Burroughs estate's history of aggressively defending IP it no longer owns through legal chicanery.

The gods reside <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on </span>Mars [or 'off' Mars, e.g. the 'heavens'; cosmos; etc]<br/>\t2. The gods came down from the stars to Barsoom [or the gods originated on Mars].<br/>\t3. 'Spirit Races' were on Mars before the gods [or were created by the gods - 'Spirit Races' are lesser entities - think elemental spirits, etc]<br/>\t4. Mars begins its existence as an ocean planet. [or as a dry rock]<br/>\t5. The gods of Mars are strictly hierarchical. [or anarchic]<br/><br/>Thus you can end up with Mars beginning as a rock in space, with the gods descending to it from beyond. Note, in this iteration, there would be no equivalent 'planet and colony codes of three letters'.<br/><br/>I need a sixth category, but haven't come up with anything yet...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448952/#Comment_448952" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-09T01:43:21+00:00" title="October  9, 2015  1:43AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             What I'm about to say may not always be true.

I think it's a great exercise in trying to clarify things.<br/><br/>What we mean by a game about Australia would be a game about co-operatively creating Australia's geography and history.<br/><br/>It is about Australia in that (the Australia of the straw man) is an Australia who's geography is limited to:<br/>1. only about a dozen major known cities;<br/>2. the Burraga Swamp and the Herveys Mountain Range;<br/>3. at the time of the Great Fire of Brisbane.<br/><br/>And this straw-man's Australia has no history before the Great Fire, save for a few hints at what came before the fire, amounting to a few paragraphs of text.<br/><br/>The assumption is that players who would want to play characters in this Australia (especially if they've never heard of a place called 'Australia') would have some questions about what it's like, and what came before the fire (especially if they are going to play native Australians).<br/><br/>The common approach, it seems, is to include a chapter on the history of Australia in the RPG rulebook. This is fine. Another approach (the one I'm exploring) is to replace that chapter with a game in itself, which would aim to make 'sure that players are familiar with the history of the gameworld without having to bore them to tears with endless exposition or giving them a novella to read'.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448980/#Comment_448980" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-11T16:41:07+00:00" title="October 11, 2015  4:41PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's important to you about Barsoom?

Drawing on <i>Microscope</i>, it would be that portion of the game when the group is listing what they want 'in' the 'Palette'.<br/><br/>For B.C, one way is for the group to look over a list of suggested 'Ingredients', and choosing things they particularly want to see. Below is a short sample from this list:<br/><br/>\u2022\tcold-blooded control of the common people by authoritarian <i>jeddaks</i><br/>\u2022\tthreats to the corrupt establishment<br/>\u2022\treason <i>versus </i>superstition<br/>\u2022\tfanatical religious authoritarianism and devotion<br/><br/>Each player chooses two of these, and then the group explores Barsoom's (pre-J.C) past to see how those themes developed through history until arriving at the stage they are upon the advent of J.C. on Mars. <br/><br/>Don't know if that's too abstract an explanation, but thought I'd keep things short for this thread.

I'd mention it in the intro though.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage" title="CreativeMage"><img alt="CreativeMage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/212/nJRPAL1YGL0U7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage">CreativeMage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449026/#Comment_449026" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-14T14:04:23+00:00" title="October 14, 2015  2:04PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for this!<br/><br/>As it involves a fundamental change in what I've been looking at, maybe I'll start a new thread to pursue what you're suggesting.

As soon as you start saying things like \u2018We\u2019re using such-and-such mechanic from game so-and-so you immediately lay yourself open to possible negative comparisons of your game with the game you\u2019ve taken that bit of the system from. You\u2019ll probably still get comments like \u2018Oh, but Game Blah does it this way\u2019, but you can simply say to that \u2018Yes, but this game isn\u2019t Game Blah\u2019.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage" title="CreativeMage"><img alt="CreativeMage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/212/nJRPAL1YGL0U7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage">CreativeMage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449050/#Comment_449050" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-15T23:31:32+00:00" title="October 15, 2015 11:31PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's wisdom there :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
