We decided on this oracle which has been used to fun effect in three systems thus far:<br/><br/>1. Choose a Traditional Fantasy Element (TM). Examples: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Dark, Spirit, Light, Wind, Ice, Lightning, etc.<br/><br/>2. Choose a Non-Traditional Element. Examples: Masks, Staircases, Bats, Desiccants, Rogues.<br/><br/>3. Choose an Element from the Periodic Table. Examples: Neon, Helium, Iron (booooo), Mercury, Arsenic, Oxygen.<br/><br/>Now create the demon's stats/powers/moves/tags/whatever in your system of choice. It is "A Demon of Fire and Masks and Neon".<br/><br/>This procedure has resulted in some very eclectic monsters, much stranger than we would otherwise have come up with. The Demon of Earth and Staircases and Mercury, for example, was pretty weak in direct combat but excelled in weird ways at traps and ambushes, while the Demon of Fire and Masks and Neon was a pretty standard elemental-type-thing but with very memorable color.<br/><br/>Anyone have other nonstandard oracles they like for demon/monster/etc generation?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467588/#Comment_467588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-09T22:41:57+00:00" title="November  9, 2017 10:41PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try adding random emotions <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467592/#Comment_467592" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-10T14:54:07+00:00" title="November 10, 2017  2:54PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using demonic iconography from middle age Europe as inspiration couldn't hurt (or Hieronymus Bosch, for example).<br/><br/>The paintings will have enough detail to inspire your portrayal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467593/#Comment_467593" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-10T15:16:12+00:00" title="November 10, 2017  3:16PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2017 3:19PM by Vivificient.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game once where we used random tables to generate Bosch-style demons.

This is actually what I'm talkin' 'bout. I want to know what part of the generation had bonus greatness. So, for the original 3-element demons:<br/><br/>The "Element from the Periodic Table" part led to some fun unanticipated gamism, where, for instance, a demon in mercury form was deemed obviously very vulnerable to (sufficient!) cold.

You roll or choose abilities from the appropriate sets.<br/><br/>For example, a demon of Flesh and Glass or Bone and Wind is a fairly evocative combination, whether you think of what those two things might be doing together (is Bone and Fire a flaming skeleton?) or whether they might suggests a hybrid (in his own examples, Water and Gas is a series of noxious, fetid pools of mud which seek to drown anyone who steps into them).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467987/#Comment_467987" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-25T14:25:54+00:00" title="November 25, 2017  2:25PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love all these!<br/><br/>Here\u2019s the demon system I created for a Victoriana Fate Core game once:\n<blockquote>Demons can be evoked (caused to appear in their own form) and invoked (caused to possess a person or object). The only unnatural power that their masters have over them, apart from the ability to summon and banish them in the first place, is that of restraint: a demon summoned inside a magic circle cannot leave it until it the circle is rubbed out.<br/><br/>Most demons long to walk the Earth (life in Hell is not pleasant) and so will readily enter into contracts with magicians, agreeing to perform myriad services in exchange for keeping them around. Demons will usually negotiate contracts as much towards their favour as possible \u2013 e.g. the right to drink a vial of their master\u2019s blood on the full moon \u2013 and will always, always try to find a way to get out of their side of the bargain through legalistic loopholes. A single misplaced comma could bring about the death of a summoner. Sometimes demons are outright insolent or destructive; and sometimes they only pretend to be bound, working against their master in a pernicious, subtle fashion, or just biding their time for the right moment to make a big power play\u2026 In D&amp;D terms, demons are all Lawful Evil.<br/><br/>In theory, any elemental or occult being is summonable. In practice, demon conjuration is restricted to demons.<br/><br/>All demons are arranged in accordance with the Hierarchy of Hell. In mechanical terms, the categories are governed by a rating on the skill ladder, that value determining:<br/><br/>* the value of the peak skill of the demon's skill column,<br/>* the passive difficulty of invoking or envoking the demon,<br/>* the active difficulty of striking an advantageous bargain with the demon,<br/>* the passive difficulty of banishing a demon if it is bound,<br/>* and the active difficulty of banishing a demon if it is free.<br/><br/>MINOR DEMONS<br/><br/>These demons are not important enough to have individual names. Rather, they do have names which are used to summon them, but nobody cares much what they are. <br/><br/>- WISPS (Average +1)<br/>0 stress, 0 consequences<br/>fist sized, usually taking the form of pure energy<br/><br/>- DRUDGES (Fair +2)<br/>1 stress, 0 consequences<br/>variable in size, usually taking the form of flora and fauna<br/><br/>- FAMILIARS (Good +3)<br/>1 stress, -2 consequence<br/>animal sized, usually taking the form of natural beasts like cats<br/><br/>- SERVITORS &amp; ATTENDANTS (Great +4)<br/>2 stress, -2 consequence<br/>dwarf sized, usually taking the form of humans, but sometimes of larger beasts like horses<br/><br/>MAJOR DEMONS<br/><br/>These demons have individual names and personalities. It is the player's responsibility to track and roleplay bound demons, and the GM's to track and roleplay free demons. Each active major demon costs the master a point of refresh.<br/><br/>- ASMODEUS AND FURIES (Superb +5)<br/>2 stress, -2/-2 consequences<br/>human sized, usually taking the form of human/beast hybrids<br/>1 master contract aspect<br/>1 character aspect in addition to high concept<br/><br/>- INCUBI AND SUCCUBI (Fantastic +6)<br/>3 stress, -2/-4 consequences<br/>human sized, usually taking the guise of supernaturally attractive humans<br/>1 master contract aspects<br/>2 character aspects in addition to high concept<br/><br/>- MALIGENII AND CALUMNIATORS (Epic +7)<br/>3 stress, -2/-2/-4 consequences<br/>giant sized, usually taking the form of unnatural monsters<br/>2 master contract aspects<br/>2 character aspects in addition to high concept<br/><br/>SERAPHIM AND CHERUBIM (Legendary +8)<br/>4 stress, -2/-4/-6 consequences<br/>giant sized, usually taking the forms of winged humans<br/>2 master contract aspects<br/>3 character aspects in addition to high concept<br/><br/>The skill LORE is used for the construction of magic circles and the incantations to bring a demon in the world, be it an invocation or an envocation. Once bound to the world, a demon can be summoned to attend its master at will. <br/><br/>The writing of DEMONIC CONTRACTS is necessary in order to allow the demon out of its binding circle safely. The master makes a LORE roll against a secret GM roll at the level of the demon in question:<br/><br/>* If the master Succeeds, the demon is bound totally and must obey the will of the master (unless the contract is broken). Fully-bound demons cannot disobey orders or break their contract.<br/>* If the master Ties, the demon is bound but retains the ability to find wiggle room in its binding to act against its master. It is automatically banished as soon as it disobeys an order to breaks its contract.<br/>* If the master Fails, the demon is free, and may act as it wishes (under the control of the GM). Sometimes, demons pretend to be bound in order to wreak havoc. Sometimes, they simply go on the rampage.<br/><br/>Once rolled, a contract cannot be changed unless the demon is banished and re-summoned. Aspects can optionally be invoked to gain advantages on contract formation, but the players will not know if they were effective. <br/><br/>Each party to the contract will take an appropriate CONTRACT ASPECT. "Bound to Master", "Master of Demon", "Possessed by Demon", or "Possessing Subject".<br/><br/>Demons of Asmodeus level and above can negotiate rewrites of these aspects incorporate whatever the demon would like or thinks would be entertaining. For example, a contract aspect on George might be "Must kiss at least one virgin a month due to demonic contract with Ashmotep".  If the contract is broken, then the demon is FREED and may act as it wishes.<br/><br/>Once a master has finished with a demon, they may choose to BANISH it back to Hell. Masters will also wish to banish demons who they have discovered to be weakly bound, or who have gone rogue in one way or another. A banish roll is a LORE skill from the master, opposed by the level of the demon - passive if bound and active if free. Demons are also banished if they run out of stress and consequences, and must be summoned again if the master wants them - the contract may be rerolled or left as it was before at the master's discretion.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467995/#Comment_467995" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-25T22:18:01+00:00" title="November 25, 2017 10:18PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have this "Dragon Radieux" issue on Demons. A memorable piece to be found in it is a random resolution table for demon summoning where you can have the janitor entering the room to tell you have to leave the building, and all kind of harping on the almighty janitor trope : in the morning you find the janitor with a broom in hand pestering about all the chalk drawings he had to erase (gasp - my demon is free), or another result where the janitor gets into the room and HE is the demon you summoned (maybe he wears a rock T-shirt with a pentagram or something), you just have no way of knowing it, but the GM will pay extreme caution to the words you say to the janitor.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
