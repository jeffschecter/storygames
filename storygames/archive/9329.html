Some people (myself among them) find theory to be exciting and suggestive of new possibilities; other people find it to be constrictive and counter-productive.

What's terrible, especially for new designers, is to have somebody point you towards a pile of theory discussions, posts, and articles and say "Read that and then design a game."  Theory should be something you <i>participate in</i>, not something you consume.  So the best way to get started in theory is to contribute something, starting a conversation or joining one in progress.<br/><br/>Like: "So this other day I was playing this game and the GM did something and it really made me feel shitty and, now that I think about it, that kind of thing always makes me feel shitty, so I was wondering what other people thought about it?  In my mind, I think it's because of XYZ and maybe, next time we play, I should recommend that the GM maybe try to do more EFG instead, because that really works for me.

When you want to push your game designs (I recommend at least 2, so that you can come to recognize commonalities between them) in new directions or refine them and are unsure how to do it. It starts, not with a need for the knowledge, but with a desire for the knowledge.<br/><br/>Theory does more than just pass on the lessons others have learned while designing their own games, it inspires people to explore new possibilities, even beyond those in the theories.

I've argued elsethread that game design postmodernism is frequently displayed in the games of the Forge diaspora, and I think that the existence of this thread must count as evidence.  There are plenty of games that explicitly critique other games, and even more that do so obliquely.  More: Over and over again, we see that the language of design criticism <i>is</i> the language of design <i>is</i> the language of play, or at least that the distinction among those modes of talking is very blurry.  I can talk about our pursuit of a modal creative agenda at the table (Josh, if you ever come play with my group, I promise we'll tone it down :-D ), or I can fuss over emphasizing certain kinds of stance-taking in my rules text, or I can grapple with some game text's use of fortune, and all of those things use the same syntax and vocabulary.<br/><br/>Hell, I'm playing around with a game where the <i>characters</i> talk about that stuff, <i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i> style.  Circle complete.<br/><br/>To me, the big insight from Magic: The Gathering is that design doesn't have to stop because play started.

For their to be a theory , someone would have to say someone else is wrong.  The closest thing that gaming has to theory is the RPG Pundit and even he, for all his verbosity, won't call someone wrong, (however useless he finds the people themsleves or their final observations).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206819/#Comment_206819" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T20:49:01+00:00" title="May 11, 2009  8:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>well the real problem is that their is NO gaming theory.</blockquote>\nOh, please, we already know that you are SOOO independent and that you hate the Forge.

Most people here have a memory, thanks.<br/><br/>Returning (I hope...) in topic: most people, after reading the forge articles, will map them over their own experiences, and this usually mean that they will mistake their technical preferences for a creative agenda (having always experienced only a single CA in all their life), misunderstand most of the examples and in general they will only continue to spread some silly view of "what these articles really say". Without some actual play experience of games that are REALLY different from each others, they will be unable to even understand Forge theory.  Let alone to use it for something useful.<br/><br/>So, always start playing some game. (post at the forge talking about your actual play experiences and people will be able to give good advice about which ones). Theory reading MUST come later. Not only when you want to create games, but even when you only want to understand Forge Theory.

Even Logos7 knows what we're referring to, so the word "theory" works just fine for the purposes of this thread.<br/><br/>I would like to amend my previous statement, thanks to Moreno's good comments, that theory can also be useful when trying to understand games that have been played, not just designed (much like crit lit can useful to readers as well as writers). I still maintain that it's best to have experience with a couple or more games, and the more the better. I don't think it's absolutely necessary to experience a game which relates to a theory in order to learn from the theory, but it does help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206829/#Comment_206829" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T21:53:18+00:00" title="May 11, 2009  9:53PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theory is integral to my way of doing art, any art.

And even then - who's to say that a given theoretical framework is meaningful for you? The only part of theory that even is a noun as opposed to a verb is the part where you argue about it with idiots in the Internet. Theory does not exist as a thing or institution, but only as a practice. Some use the practice, some don't.<br/><br/>So my answer to Graham is that for me theory is undisputably useful, but the useful part is not studying at the feet of the masters or something like that, but rather the practical benefits my thinking gains from taking part in theoretical thought. If somebody else is not gaining these benefits, that's because they approach game design and gameplay differently. The value of theory is subjective, just as with any communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206830/#Comment_206830" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T22:01:19+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 10:01PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2009 10:05PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>I guess that would depend on what "theory" is. Which I'm not trying to say as a one-line rebuttal, but to offer why, I'll share an anecdote:<br/><br/>After Dreamation, Ralph Mazza &amp; I were talking about Master Plan, and I said "I don't do a theory show." He called bullshit on that, and after a long discussion we came to the idea (paraphrased &amp; possible twisted thanks to memory) that one person talking about practical application &amp; experience is theory to another. When I talk about, say, the tangible nature of mechanics in role-playing games (as people who know me &amp; talk with me often know I'm prone to discussing, as it's a favorite subject of mine), I'll talk about this experience or that experience and how it's lead me to think about mechanics in a different way.<br/><br/>To me, that's practice. To others, that's theory -- the moment I move away from a story of experience to what I extrapolated from them it turns into theory. Theory comes from practice distilled into discussion, at least in this sort of touchy-feely realm.<br/><br/>Now, that might not pass a bullshit test to some. I don't know, and I suppose ultimately I don't care -- I'm all for the thought of the individual. I don't really like thinking of myself as a "theory guy," because I used to take the stance that there was no such thing as actual RPG theory. However, <em>at this point in time</em> that notion scans as lazy thinking <em>for me</em>.  But I digress. (And for a momentary further digression, I only buy theory that's backed by evidence of practice, and then only enough to try it for myself. Touchy-feely indeed.)<br/><br/>That said, I think this can be applied to Actual Play -- at least when AP goes from glorifying &amp; bitching about a game to sharing with others what can be learned or extrapolated from a given session. That's also theory. More importantly, it might be "play theory" rather than "design theory."  The former only seems to get love when we form it in the latter, or as "practice" rather than "theory."  I don't know if that's a useful distinction or not, but I suppose that's for the individual to consider.  (In fact, Graham, I would say that Play Unsafe is play theory.)<br/><br/>...All of which is a long-winded way of saying: "The point of theory in the RPG realm is possibly to communicate core ideas without the baggage of <em>constantly</em> explaining how you arrived to them or the practice behind them <em>every single time</em>."  Theory certainly isn't a substitute at all (not even a poor one in my mind) for practice. In fact, I would even go as far as saying that theory requires context to full appreciate (not "understand," but "appreciate") and that until one has built up enough practice to provide that context, theory scans pretty much as bullshit.  It can help us become better designers or players, but <em>not right out of the gate.</em>  Theory is the upper-division of gaming, and it has nebulous, undefinable prerequisites, and sometimes it makes sense to skip ahead without all the prereqs.<br/><br/><strong>That said, knowing theory doesn't make you a cooler, better, smarter, or whatever person. It just means you've obsessed over this subject to a point far beyond what most people would consider casual, for good and ill.</strong> (Bolded for emphasis, and yet I still think this is understated.)<br/><br/>(And yes, I'm probably talking a bit of half-assed communication theory here.)<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206842/#Comment_206842" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T23:34:32+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 11:34PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say; start with reading everything, both of theory and real games.

There are theories that seek to account for some small parts of gaming but the majority of gaming happens merrily ignorant of and unexamined by theory. Although I might concede that there are hypotheses.<br/><br/>I seem to remember that the remit of theory was to find out why some people weren't having fun the games they were playing and to discover what they needed to have fun. As such, "theory" is fairly biased towards what these people want from their games.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not against theory. I think it's useful for people to consider their gaming and I published a fair amount of theory in Places to Go, People to Be. So I'd encourage people to read what Ron and others have said because it will give you an insight into a different way of looking at your games and to some of the considerations that concern players of these games.<br/><br/>If it does nothing else, theory says, 'Consider the needs of your audience'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206862/#Comment_206862" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T07:27:38+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  7:27AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>With that in mind, what's the point of theory?

The Big Model---if taken by itself---*IS* remarkably impractical. But a lot of the surrounding theory, that either assumes the Big Model or has grown out of it, is very practical, and can actually help us design and play better.<br/><br/>A quickie example would be, like, Flags. The idea of a player Flag is very down to earth, and has obvious and immediate implications for design and play.

I think this is the most useful kind of gaming theory. It's partial and internally contradictory and fascinating.  <br/><br/>If you look at the Big Model and all the stuff that goes along with it, it's interesting, but it's not validated and never will be.  (Imagine it -- bored grad students running hundreds of people through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tomb of Horrors</span> and doing testing before and after...)  I found the <i>discourse </i> about theory interesting, but the ongoing attempts to systematize and fit the whole thing into one Unified Field Theory not so much.  <br/><br/>Where should people look for theoretical inspiration?  For my part, I'd love to see ideas coming from the fields of psychology and economics, where theories about how people form groups, negotiate among each other, respond to incentives, etc. have been developed and tested rigorously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206881/#Comment_206881" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T08:49:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  8:49AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My design process is something like this:<br/><br/>1. Some weird inspiration hits me, unformed.<br/>2. I start playing with ideas. I design game stuff.<br/>3. I mentally touch back to some theory. More on this later.<br/>4. I write a game.<br/>5. I playtest the game. It inevitably breaks.<br/>6. I analyze why the game broke using theory.<br/>7. I redesign the game and repeat the playtest, analyze, redesign cycle until it's good enough.<br/><br/>Design is not divorced from play. Game design requires playtesting or else it's just game writing. The Big Model (or the body of it that I have adopted and changed in my own mind) is a theory of play and is well-suited for improving game designs during the playtest phase. <br/><br/>Now, in step 3, before I've played the thing, I am still touching on theory. I am imagining how people will play my game and making predictions using the theory of play to determine what might happen. <br/><br/>There's also a part of the theory that is more descriptive than predictive. For example, TBM has the five parts of Exploration. When I design, I consciously think about character, setting, situation, color, and system and how they interact. I think about points of contact. I think a lot about IIEE. I think about stuff from other models, too, like sockets.<br/><br/>Just having names for parts of a game help me design, because it's a mental checklist of stuff to think about. I have a mental vocabulary to slice up the cow into different cuts rather than simply calling it all "meat" (or "murder," if you prefer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206882/#Comment_206882" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T08:50:40+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  8:50AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read all the theory stuff, and then I designed a game, and I think it turned out pretty okay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206902/#Comment_206902" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T11:00:03+00:00" title="May 12, 2009 11:00AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading and participating in theory = thinking hard about games and play.

That play is the same thing as theory is nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who play games and who want to think hard about them, generally do not discuss their hard thinking at the table while they're playing.  They do so after they've played.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharing the experiences of your play and what worked and what didn't and what could make it better next time with people who were not at the table with you = theorizing.  More accurately it = hypothesising which then turns into theory when those ideas are tried in future games and found to work / not work / sort of work.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay -- leads to talking about play -- leads to thinking about ways to make play better -- leads to trying those ways out in play -- leads to evaluating the effectiveness of those ways -- leads to codifying the ways that reliably worked -- leads to sharing the resultant codification -- leads to better play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the cycle of theory.  A cycle in which play is featured prominently...but is not, in and of itself, sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne category of ways to make play better is "play with better rules" -- which requires someone writing better rules -- which requires someone to have thought about those ways to play better so they can be included in their rules.  This is why theory is important to design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206958/#Comment_206958" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T14:48:53+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  2:48PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think some people totally like to have some intellectual activity served up along with their game.  Maybe it's the gaming equivalent of Brecht's alienated theater, where the stage is bare and the actors come out after the curtain to talk about their roles with the audience and discuss how it could have turned out differently.  I love that stuff, but it's never been as popular as Shakespeare or Tennesee Williams.  (Graham, back me up here.)<br><br>Similarly, some people enjoy some "meta" and some theory with their kung fu, and this fuels the interest in indie games.  You can be a happy, functional gamer or even game designer and not get into this stuff.  At least, that's how I see it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206979/#Comment_206979" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T17:07:25+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  5:07PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a data point, Vincent's recent conversations on Clouds, Arrows, and Boxes just totally destroyed my thinking on Silent Sound.

In the end I think it pays off, but I think the payoff (at least at the community scale, individuals may progress faster) occurs years further down the line than most people expect. For example, the theory developed at the Forge resulted in a lot of repeated explanations of what they meant. This went on for several years and only a few games got made. Now, at Story Games, we see a lot more games made. It's not the switch from the Forge to Story Games that did it, though I suspect it was a nice symbolic trigger, it's the time everyone invested in doing (3) now producing a payoff in our ability to do (1). Even our ability to do (3) has improved, thanks to practice, bringing new people up to speed faster.<br/><br/>So, regarding the original post's question of when to read theory, the counter-position to my suggestion of "after making 2 or more games" is more-or-less, "after trying something (even once) and wanting it to be better." There also seems to be a few that dislike theory altogether, which might count as a "never" votes. Are there other positions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
