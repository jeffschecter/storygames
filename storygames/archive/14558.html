In short, I like the idea of an "RPG Coach" for kids, but I'm fundamentally opposed to the notion of charging people for GMing services, because of the implications of the relationship and the effect on the game. But I do recognize that there is a possibility for creating a market where people go to events to be entertained, at potentially much less than the cost of a movie ticket, and that providing such services could be a potentially viable way to support oneself.<br/>Also, being a convention owner &amp; organizer, I'm pretty interested in hearing people's views on the notion of charging for gameplay, charging for event logistics, or charging for event-associated product (e.g. snacks, beer). <a href="http://www.hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">HammerCon</a>, for example, doesn't charge per game - even though doing that would be beneficial for space accounting purposes - because it's contrary to our beliefs: we charge for providing a venue where you can access great games and great gamers, not for the play experience itself; that's provided by the organizer and the other players.<br/>Any comment on providing gaming as a service for pay is fair game for this thread - GMing services, access to a game library, access to a venue, custom scenario design, weekly games to mini-cons to full-sized cons, gaming cafes/bars - whatever you can think of. What do you think of it philosophically and pragmatically, and how can it work or miserably fail financially?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331567/#Comment_331567" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T08:51:10+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  8:51AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2011 9:32AM by Tavis.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are problems with all aspects of the commercialization of RPGs. IMO, one of the OSR's more important contributions has been bringing attention to the ways that becoming an industry has had detrimental effects on the kinds of products that are produced. We worry about the detrimental effects of commercial RPG services because they're unfamiliar, whereas we're generally used to people wanting to make a buck from writing and design. We know of creators who make good products in a commercial environment. We don't know, and those who told me about this asked me not to reveal, which of those creators are hired by fans to run games for them for $100 an hour. How do those games compare to ones run by the same GM for friends instead of customers? I dunno; the stigma associated with pay-for-play makes public discussion of the problems more difficult.<br/><br/>See <a href="http://cyclopeatron.blogspot.com/2011/04/need-your-opinion-new-model-for.html" rel="nofollow">a recent blog post by Cyclopeatron</a> about special guest GMs at North Texas RPG Con for a discussion of the problems involved in having the con pay for the attendance of a few GMs and passing those costs to all con-goers, even though few of them will be able to play in those games. I got into Erol Otus and Paul Jaquays' games at NTRPG by setting my alarm to wake up in the middle of the night and hitting refresh on my web browser a bazillion times, but this metric of desire or deservingness is not invulnerable to commercial corruption - I could have demonstrated how much I wanted to be there by hiring someone to hit refresh for me.<br/><br/>I wrote to Cyclopeatron about this:\n<blockquote>The celebrity GM thing is something I've thought a lot about in regards to my RPG-service businesses Adventuring Parties and its predecessor Otherworld Excursions. I think your commenters have focused on the ethical aspect of having some people pay reg fees to support celeb GMs whose games they won't get to play in, which is great; you have a thoughtful group of blog-readers. However, in the larger universe there are going to be people who feel that it's like prostitution to have people pay to play RPGs at all; that it's unethical for people to charge for a service others do for love.<br/><br/>I don't agree with that one bit; I've never worked as a prostitute so I can't take the analogy that far, but I still love gaming I do for money, and I think it's bad for the state of gaming that the only way to make money at it is by writing not playing. RPGs are a performing art, but our greatest performers can only get paid by writing sheet music for others. I see no real reason to assume that people good at one will be good at the other, and having been a freelancer I believe the opposite is true; actually playing cuts into the time you need to spend writing if you want to make a living at it. <br/><br/>One thing you can do to assuage this criticism is to make the proceeds of the auction go to a charity. A lot of what I know about how much people are willing to pay for celebrity GM experiences ($20 per hour or more) comes from games Dave Arneson would run for con charity auctions. The other data come from celebrity GMs who've been approached by fans who'll pay them to run games for them; said GMs asked me to keep this private because there's controversy/shame attached to it. The charity aspect defuses that for everyone involved - you can still use the proceeds to cover costs, the DMs can still have their expenses paid for &amp; even get an honorarium, but the idea that it's happening for a good cause makes it accepted.<br/><br/>The golden ticket idea is also a good one: some seats go to the highest bidder, while some go to the winner of a lottery. Charging a little bit for a lottery ticket is a good idea IMO: like having sign-up go only to those people willing to wait in line/wake up at 1 am and hit refresh/otherwise invest unusual effort in getting into the game, a nominal fee ensures that all players really want to be there &amp; doesn't create a gap between those who paid to be there and those who didn't, only a difference in how much they paid.<br/><br/>You might also reserve some seats for a friend or friends of the GM. I think it'd be super cool to play not just with Erol but with some guys from his regular group, and this might increase the celebrity appeal.<br/><br/>Finally, I think that doing a video or audio recording is a good idea - maybe not in every case but if some of the proceeds from other celebrity events go to documenting the performance art of gaming's founders who do feel comfortable on camera, I think that's a good cause many people can get behind. Personally I can think of several old-schoolers who I wish would stop thinking that what they need to do is write yet more modules, and would love to pay to run games and share their experiences directly instead.</blockquote>\nSome notes:<br/>- In the original thread you raise a philosophical issue - the delusion that the GM is the provider of all awesomeness - which I think is often a pragmatic one. You see a lot of unrealistic pro-GM business plans because the plan is predicated on this unreal assumption about the GM's role; when I try to talk to some of these would-bes about the difficulty they'll face, I can see them thinking "yeah that was a problem for you because neither you nor anyone else is as awesome as I am, the world will beat a path to my door to get some of <i>my</i> mojo."<br/><br/>- In the particular old-school scene Cyclopeatron is talking about, I've already seen some of the pragmatics of this play out. There are founding fathers that I did indeed invest quite a bit (travel, hotel, etc) to play in a game run by them; they weren't wrong that I was eager to see their mojo in action. Those who didn't let it go to their heads - who took our devoted buy-in as an opportunity to show us their particular flavor of good time and set us loose on it, not to grandstand or be a diva - are folks I'd gladly pay to play with again, even after the historical value/bucket list factor is over. (Erol Otus's game was fan-effin'-tastic, and I think not coincidentally paired with not taking himself very seriously. He had a great DM screen of his artwork, and when people stopped by to say how amazing it was he'd say "Yeah, isn't it cool? I got these off the Internet!")<br/><br/>- Once you get over the idea of the GM as the center of all greatness, some of the problems with the fact that 90% of all fun will come from the paying customers can be resolved more easily. You can have not just a professional GM but also some professional players - maybe acknowledged "special guests" to add to the cool factor people like me will pay for, maybe ringers who seem like one of the players but can be counted on to raise the bar for everyone else and support the GM in steering clear of bad situations. And you can be quick to say "sorry, you're ruining the fun of everyone else, here's your refund" if you don't imagine your GM-fu is so great that it will make everyone have an awesome time (and when that doesn't happen it's your fault, you just have to try harder.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331574/#Comment_331574" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T10:33:03+00:00" title="June 25, 2011 10:33AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would seem worth considering also why anyone ever uses any sort of paid service when DIY is an option.<br/><br/>Convenience is one, especially where time is a factor. Expert skill is another. Access to necessary tools and the cost of them and time needed to use them properly is another still. I'd imagine work space can factor in there as well.<br/><br/>Exploratory plunges into something new probably fits here, as well as things done on an irregular basis.<br/><br/>Along with all of that is also a money factor. Sometimes it simply makes more economic sense, with all of the above factors considered to simplyu pay someone else a premium for a service, since it would be vastly cheaper than gaining the expertise involved yourself.<br/><br/>All of that is fine and good of course, but around these parts, folks like real world examples, right? I can't give real world examples of For Pay GMing, but I can give a couple of examples from related stuff.<br/><br/>Caesar_X and I, through a buddy of his, Nick, briefly became interested in Old West skirmish gaming. I'm a minis head, as is Nick ( although NIck's commitment to forms of that hobby makes my own look embarassingly modest). Anyway, both Caesar_X and myself decided to buy some minis for these bashes. I already have a bunch of DIY stuff, so I went out and scrounged and bought appropriately and DIY'd.<br/><br/>Caesar_X found a site selling prepainted Old West minis and bought some. I think his cost was around $7-10 each ( pretty modest for figure painting services in the US, but they were also off-the-rack rather than custom jobs.). I think he spent around $60-70 total. When he was deciding on whether to buy pre-paints or get unpainted minis and DIY them, we did some calculations. I think I ended up figuring out that it would have cost him something like $30-50  for supplies to paint them, and close to that for the minis themselves.<br/><br/>It would have left him with supplies to do many more minis of course. But it would have also cost him time ( he didn't have a lot with other real-life commitments), space ( also a premium for him at the time-setting up a workspace would have been tricky), and of course, as anyone who hase painted up gaming minis knows, he would have been learning all of the painting stuff for the first time, likely leading to less-than-impressive results (almost everyone's first time painting forays are heartbreaking for them and vastly more time-consuming than they imagine).<br/><br/>He only needed a half dozen or so minis. Ever. For a game he enjoyed but only intended to play occasionally.<br/><br/>To me, that's a classic game related case of where use of a service makes great sense on a number of levels.<br/><br/>Murder Mystery Party in a Box vs Murder Mystery and Dinner<br/>How much do those Murder Mystery Boxed Thingies sell for these days? I'm guessing around $45 but I haven't checked recently. Anyone know how much a Murder Mystery Dinner goes for per person? I'll guess  in the $60-100 range.<br/><br/>So why choose one over the other? I mean, why not always choose the Murder Box and DIY? The money savings must be vast, right?<br/><br/>The hassle of organizing the party and the necessary space. Plus, you get to participate and not just host if you do the Mystery Dinner or Weekend or whatever. And, perhaps your pals just aren't all that dead-keen on the thing. Organizing just yourself and a date or a pal to go hit a Murder Dinner thing is just plain easier than rounding up 8 or so working adults for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>Non-Game Examples that might apply: Thrill Experiences<br/>There are tons of people who sky-dive, or horseback ride, or jet ski, or scuba dive, whatever. Usually, there are also services that are geared to people exploring that hobby and want to try it one time, or only occasionally. Again, you end up paying a premium but you get to try the thing out, and the folks offering the service/rentals also pretty much go out of their way to make sure you have a good time, regardless of whether they expect to see you back and buying goodies to become a hobbyist yourself.<br/><br/>All of those seem like factors that could potentially go into/influence Paid Service Gaming businesses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331662/#Comment_331662" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T06:59:19+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  6:59AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2011 7:03AM by elkin.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the past three years, I've been teaching D&amp;D in one of these Israeli after-school activities contractors that were mentioned in the "Make a Living" thread. I've also had a chance to undergo some training at another such company, and I have a friend who has been starting a new company in the past few months, so I assume I have a relatively broad perspective on the subject.<br/><br/>Our job title isn't 'teacher' (because we're not certified) or 'DM' (because that's not a real job). Rather, we are described by a word that translates roughly as "guide". Running these groups, to my experience, requires more educator-fu than GM-fu. A great deal of challenge comes from teaching the kids to hold a conversation without lashing at each other, to agree on what's fair and what's right, to know when to submit to the will of the group and when to insist on something that's important to you. Knowing how tell apart real-life problems from game problems, understanding and sharing authority, and keeping quiet and listening when somebody else speaks out. Learning how to brainstorm and debate.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this, and not GMing, is the service I'm getting paid for. I usually GM only until the 10th session or so, after which I give the role to one of the children, and I get to focus on the social facet of the activity. I contribute content occasionally when the GM stumbles, but I'm more inclined to guide the children to seek out their own inspiration for their own scenarios.<br/><br/>That's only my take on it, though, and my way of rationalizing my charging money for a hobby that I always claimed "requires no more than imagination, a pencil and a sheet of paper". I try to use my paid GMing time as a springboard to inspire DIY GMing among the kids I teach.<br/><br/>I know at least one of my colleagues who doesn't have these qualms, and who considers his GMing and campaign-writing skills a primary part of the service he provides, and holds himself to be an entertainer first and educator second.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331664/#Comment_331664" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T07:30:31+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  7:30AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2011 7:31AM by Tavis.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            elkin, that's awesome!

My apologies in advance if they're a little disjointed, there's a lot of ground to cover here and I like the discussion.<br/><br/>Cons: After many, many years of involvement at Cons on the local and national level, Is become pretty clear to me that the main purpose of charging per event is to act as a barrier to entry rather than as any sort of remuneration for GMs. The days of GMs getting compensation for running games is long past at GenCon, for example, and most local Cons don't pay GMs anything. Some shows may comp a badge or something if you run a set number of events, but in the vast majority of cases, those per-event fees that people are paying are there for the reason Paul cites in his excellent discussion about that Otus game he sat in on: they're a way to assure commitment. If all events are free to enter, then everyone is going to sign up for every slot and drop as they fill their schedule with other stuff. This Is obviously less of a problem a much smaller Con, like a JiffyCon or the gaming track at a small SF Con, but it gets increasingly important as the venue grows. Most of the time, we're taking just a couple of bucks (at Origins, it's a dollar an hour!). But the payment assures that there is value attached to the transaction.<br/><br/>Also, I just don't really see how charging people for entry to a Con with scheduled events isn't 'charging them to game'. They're paying for access to the games and the GMs and perhaps industry professionals if they're present. Whether they pay a per-event fee or not, they've stepped forward to say they attach a value to someone else organizing their gaming experience(s) for them. The second you charge even a dollar for entry to your Con, you are by definition 'charging people for gaming'. Which, of course, there is NOTHING WRONG WITH. The beauty of the setup is that people who find value in the transaction will take advantage, and those who don't, won't.<br/><br/>Gaming/GMing as a 'job': I maintain a pretty broad definition of what it means to 'get paid to GM'. I have a customer who is a HS Latin teacher who runs the DnD club at his school. During the hours he is running those games, he's a paid DM. When I run Encounters at the store, I'm getting paid to DM, and when we have an Indie Game Night, I'm getting paid to facilitate Fiasco. Running GoD as GAMAs liaison was close enough to being a professional GM that I'm comfortable including that in the conversation, even though I didn't get paid as such. One of the truisms of any hobby industry (I see a lot of this in comics) is that so much compensation comes in the form of barter, prestige, and quid pro quo that it gets easy to start thinking of all those transactions as somehow being 'uncompensated', that those people are working for 'free'. To draw the line when that compensation occurs in the form of payment in cash at a rate that approaches a wage (God forbid, a LIVING wage) seems awfully arbitrary. Regardless, I am here to tell anyone reading that that getting paid to DM/GM/MC/Storytell/Keep/facilitate RPGs for pay is the best job in the world, and I would love nothing more than to see as many people make a living, or even just a few bucks, at it as possible. <br/><br/>More as it occurs and responses generate new Qs and As.

The owner's love was RPGs, but comics paid the bills (y'know, sort of, for a while).  He ran nice railroady games of the day and his games were very popular.  He always had a list of people who wanted in and he'd "fire" players who didn't meet his needs.  One of those needs was that they bought enough stuff at the store.  His D&amp;D game was running through Mayfair's remake of <i>City State of the Invincible Overlord</i> and the players were expected to buy and read the supplements as they came out and the campaign followed them. So the relationship wasn't as straight-forward as running for cash, but it was reasonably close.  It seemed to me that all the participants were happy with the situation (except the players who were fired).<br/><br/>I wouldn't want to make a job of my hobby -- at least not <i>this</i> hobby, because I wouldn't want it to become "work" but I don't see anything wrong with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331890/#Comment_331890" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T10:46:17+00:00" title="June 27, 2011 10:46AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pay to play in a game once a month for around 10 hours of gaming and I personally find it perfect for me.

Most of them are larps, like <a href="http://www.heroquest-larp.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Heroquest</a> and <a href="http://www.wizardquest.net/htm/whatIs.html" rel="nofollow">Wizard Quest</a>.  These are sickeningly commercial, but necessarily so.<br/><br/>I find the notion of earning a living as a GM only conceivable outside of the strictures of capitalism, which otherwise force a minute few professional cultural producers to endlessly clamor for attention, status and steady gigs.  This is compounded by the role-playing convention's complicity (as an institution) with corporate hotel complexes, the oil industry (regarding travel) and scandalously low-paying food vendors. If housing, travel and food were subsidized within arm's reach, I'll bet you'd find dozens of people going off to become "professional GMs."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
