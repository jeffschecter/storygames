I've played a lot in seasons where stories progress from the pilot through the final episode, but now I want to try a show where each episode is generally self-contained.  Things can change a little, but each episode is a complete, self-contained package. Think "The A-Team".<br/><br/>If you've played this way, how do you handle "next week on..."?  How do you build toward addressing Issues?  Are there other stumbling blocks?  <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196251/#Comment_196251" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T08:09:49+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  8:09AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if you could do "client stories" -- each episode, someone plays a new character, and it's that character's issue that is the center of everything.  You know, the A-Team shows up to build a battlewagon and fire a watermelon cannon at evil land developers in order to bring an estranged daughter closer to her lovable curmudgeon of a father, that sort of thing.  Then in the next episode, the A-Team shows up to pretend to be roadies for a rock group and protect them from evil recording industry executives in order to remind the lead singer that he needs the rest of the band to keep him grounded.<br/><br/>I bet someone, somewhere could make that work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196268/#Comment_196268" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T09:52:07+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  9:52AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take a look at 'Burn Notice' for an excellent structure for this sort of thing:  Each episode, there is the 'A' plot, which is the client story, and the 'B' plot, which is Michael working toward solving his own problem.  In almost every episode, the 'A' plot sheds a little light on the 'B' plot.  They aren't connected, but they harmonize, emotionally or symbolically.  The "next week on..." bits show an action scene from the 'A' plot, but finish with an emotion- or stress-laden scene from the 'B' plot.  <br/><br/>Pulling out of 'Burn Notice' for a moment, here's an example of what I mean, made up out of whole cloth:<br/><br/>It's a hospital show, about the doctors and nurses who work there:  Each episode there will be a 'patient of the week' who has a problem (the 'A' plot).  The 'B' plot for Season One is Dr. Welles slow descent into alcoholism, and how that wrecks the lives of those around him.  <br/>In Episode One, there is a little girl with a mystery disease.  She'll die unless Welles and his team figure out what the problem is.  Either way it plays out, a little light is shed on the 'B' plot, introduced here:  The girl is saved, and we see the staff celebrating after work with champagne -- and Welles is obviously more-than-tipsy.  The girl dies, and we see Welles in his study at home, with a bottle of whiskey, blotting out the darkness.<br/>Next week on... The 'patient of the week' is someone with an addiction of some sort.  We get an action scene of an emergency room, and staff trying to keep the ODed patient alive.  We get a dramatic scene of the patient's family members, breaking under the stress.  Next we get a drama scene, of staff members talking.  Every line of dialogue can be taken two ways -- referring to the patient, and referring to Dr. Welles.  During the episode, the big 'B' plot scene comes when when Welles gives the patient Hell about the damage he's doing to his family, the audience realizes that Welles has no idea that what he is saying could be applied to himself as well...<br/><br/>Stuff like that.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196269/#Comment_196269" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T10:02:13+00:00" title="March  9, 2009 10:02AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, that's excellent advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196271/#Comment_196271" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T10:05:35+00:00" title="March  9, 2009 10:05AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The issue that I would be watching out for is to make sure everyone really believes and accepts that at the end of every episode, we all push the big RESET button and things are back to the way they were before.<br/><br/>Sure, maybe in this episode, the Skipper learned a valuable lesson about how he should cherish Gilligan, and the Professor built an aircraft carrier out of coconuts, and the Howells lost all their money and jewels in a freakish monkey incident.  When the episode ends, everything resets.  No continuity.  Next time we start, the Skipper is still beating on Gilligan as much as ever, there's still no way off the island, and everyone is wearing the same clothes.<br/><br/>Of course, I could be entirely wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196338/#Comment_196338" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T17:35:38+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  5:35PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2009 5:38PM by jessecoombs.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. Some ideas.<br/><br/>-At least one player must play a brand new character.<br/>-Characters have two issues; a regular one, and a smaller one that is rewarded each episode with budget/card/etc. (Not fanmail. That still comes from other players.)<br/>-There's a mini pitch session at the beginning of each episode that outlines the basics setting of the plot: MacGuyver is in Vietnam, a genie visits Baywatch Nights!<br/>-Ditch "Next on's..."<br/>-The series itself has an arc. 1 is problem of the week, 2 is problem of the week with character change or foreshadowing, 3 is series meta-plot stuff: the other "leaper" in Quantum Leap, various X-Files, etc<br/>-The main character, if there is one, is played by each player at least once before the season is over, reflecting different writers<br/>-In addition or instead of edges, characters have "Cliches"<br/>-Everyone has to take a connection to the main focus of the story, if they aren't themselves. So, unless you are playing AS Dr. House, you have to take a connection to him, or to Airwolf, or KIT.<br/>-Once per season, an episode has to be "a very special episode of..." focusing on something important, sad, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88U3VLva-u4" rel="nofollow">real-lifey.</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brenton" title="Brenton"><img alt="Brenton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brenton">Brenton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196408/#Comment_196408" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T10:46:14+00:00" title="March 10, 2009 10:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look at (the New) Doctor Who for an even better example of a compelling show with almost no "B" plot.  Each episode, the Doctor and his companion visit a new world and help them solve some kind of problem there.  There are occasionally hints of an ongoing plot or foreshadowing, but they are much more in the "Why does that word keep showing up?" vein than any sort of ongoing plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also some character development-type plots--Martha loves the Doctor but can't express it, for example--but even those are very minor and don't really go anywhere until the last episode of the season, where they're resolved.  For example, Martha loves the Doctor and talks about here suppressed love to everyone but him, but nothing about that changes until she has to decide to leave him or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe suggestion to treat Edges as Cliches is a good idea.  Alternatively, replace the Screen Presence mechanic with a Cliche one.  In this way, everyone gets two cards.  If they bring in their issue (i.e. Martha incorporates her frustrated love for the Doctor) into the conflict, they get an extra card.  There could be a limit on how often this could be done.  This way, the mechanical weight of issues is maintained, but it operates in a similar manner to that seen in shows like Giligan's Island and Doctor Who.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
