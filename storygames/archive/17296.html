The demerits build up during the game and in the Epilogue get converted into demerit dice, which the GM rolls to decide the ultimate fate of the frat house the characters are members of.<br/><br/>At a skill check the players roll a d6 pool based on their character\u2019s skill point total, with demerits at 1s and 2s. During the last few months of playtesting one or two people have suggested using a different dice or demerit trigger to reduce the demerits a bit. The game is currently regulated by House Points (akin to plot points, style points, bennies or whatever) such that the demerit total can be brought down either by re-rolls and/or reducing the dice pool (which is inversely proportional to the skill point total). I\u2019ve experimented with having demerits at 1s on d6s and 1s and 2s on d8s, instead of 1s and 2s on d6s. The results were interesting. They showed that with only 1s on d6s there were nowhere near enough demerits being produced, but the system worked fairly well with d8s, which is to say that the HPs have less work to do. I\u2019m perfectly happy to go with d8s, but I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s been a bit of a movement away from using hedralities other than d6 unless absolutely necessary.  <br/><br/>So, my question is this: would folks prefer a system that uses d8s, where the mechanics work an absolute treat, but you need upwards of 14 dice, or d6s- which obviously most gamers have in abundance, but where the demerit totals are relatively high (but can be brought down using the House Points)? Not everybody will be interested in playing this particular game, obviously, in which case the question is hypothetical, not to say academic, but I\u2019d still like to hear folks\u2019 thoughts.<br/><br/>Can't find a 'create poll' function on this site, so the question would be:<br/>How do you feel about having to (buy and) roll loads of d8s (with an average of around 10-14)?<br/><br/>And the answers:<br/>A: I don't mind rolling lots of d8s if d8s are perfect for the system.<br/>B: I'd rather be rolling d6s, and let the House Points regulate the demerits.<br/><br/><br/>Thanking y\u2019all in advance.<br/>Cheers Leo<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392146/#Comment_392146" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T15:53:18+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  3:53PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that option B is a potential opportunity for you as a designer, not a fault in the system. At least I find similar situations a boon in my own design work, as they justify and connect to further mechanical layers, like the House Points in your case.<br/><br/>That being said, I personally have no problem with d8s, as I've long since committed to owning a sizable dice collection. I play many games that require exotic mixes of dice, a d8 pool system isn't nearly the worst. This is the case with many hardcore hobbyists. You probably should figure out where your market lies - maybe it's here on this site, in which case a popularity poll like this might be helpful. Maybe it is among casual gamers, in which case <i>any</i> pool system is problematic. I would expect that most people who have plenty of d6s are also not above buying some d8s if they don't have them already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392147/#Comment_392147" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T15:55:30+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  3:55PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sight unseen, it's hard to say.

It's fairly easy to tinker with sidedness and target numbers once you have that ratio in hand.

Because 1+1=2 :-)<br/><br/>[Intuitively you might think it makes more sense for a 1 to be "worse" than a 2, but I think the 1+1=2 makes a nice mnenomic.)<br/><br/>And it turns out this is quite closely related, as a mathematical idea, to what 1of3 was thinking too.<br/><br/>Personally I wouldn't rely on die-rolling apps / websites. Sure, for the 16-24 age bracket they might have a similar appeal to dice (variable across the population that age though), but for people our age and up, I think it's a small minority who'd ever use die-roller apps in their games {except for remote-gaming purposes obviously}. I could be wrong. Certainly it doesn't hold the same appeal to me. Personal electronics are just an annoying distraction at the gaming table as far as I'm concerned. I've seen people GM from laptops before and I didn't feel it did anything to assist them - quite the contrary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392177/#Comment_392177" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T01:47:29+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  1:47AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            d6                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392189/#Comment_392189" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T06:14:26+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  6:14AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            d6's are getting kind of boring to me.

Before I get into the subject of the OP, I'd just like to say that it's great that so many of you have given the question serious thought. This shows me two things: one, that the roleplaying community is fantastically helpful and supportive and one that I'm really glad to be a part of, and two, that every bit of the mechanics of a game is important and a good designer should consider all the ramifications of an idea before putting the game out. <br/><br/>So, my reaction so far: it looks like there's plenty of love for d8s ( a lot more than I'd predicted in fact), which, as I said, seem to work best for the system so I'm going to use them for the next round of playtests and see what happens. All along I had a nagging feeling that something wasn't right, because the way I had it before the House Points had to do a lot of work to regulate the system. Also, I\u2019ve tweaked the Hoint Points a bit themselves, so that fewer of them now come to the GM for use in the Epilogue, <br/><br/>Secondly, folks don't seem to mind <i>buying</i> a lot of dice, although there is some disquiet about <i>rolling </i>lots of. Let me try to allay this worry. Yes, you <i>could</i> be rolling up to 17 dice (if penalty dice are added for various difficulty factors- location, time of day etc.), but this is at very low skill levels; in practice players typically roll 10-12. Also, during playtesting it hasn't been an issue, at least no-one's mentioned it on the feedback forms, and I think this is because there is a lot of excitement at how the result of their characters\u2019 actions will be narrated by the GM- i.e. what's the fall out going to be- and as soon as the dice hit the table players are going uh-oh, four demerits, that must mean blah is going to happen. <br/><br/>As for the cost, well, I got in touch a while back with a UK-based company about doing some branded dice, and the cost actually turns out to be not that high. Plus, even if after playing SFBK you never want to play another catty_big game as long as you live, you've still got those dice, which you can then use for other games. Somebody mentioned that White Wolf uses a lot of d10s and the use of them is increasing; well, if my game comes out with d8s I think it highly likely that other designers will consider using them too. What I'll probably do regarding publication is to sell the book and say 20 branded d8s (well, some are going to get lost, aren't they?) as a bundle. I think somebody either here or on another forum actually made this suggestion. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/1o3">@1o3</a> &amp; omnifray: yeah, thanks, these are interesting sugestions, but I think because SFBK has an exttremely simple system which facilitates a high degree of roleplaying, I\u2019m reluctant to build in more complexity. There  a fair amonut of book-keeping, but only on the GM\u2019s part, and that can be done while the players are having fun wrecking college property, stealing stuff and getti ng off their f-, er, getting every so slightly intoxicated on weird alien pharmceuticals. <a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a>: Yes, I agree, tinkering with one part of the system can be an opportunity to revisit other parts of it and improve the game as a result.<br/><br/>Finally, as we\u2019re now going for  25% chance of demerits, as creases points out, d4s, d8s and d12s are all usable, although if d4s I\u2019d go for the dodec ones as d4 tets are horrible monstrosities which should never have been allowed to come into existence. Ever trod on one in socked feet by mistake? [Shudder].<br/><br/>Cheers y\u2019all<br/>Leo<br/><br/>P.S. I haven't so far spoken to discussions on this forum as much as I'd have liked, mainly because I haven't been roleplaying all that long (two years in November!) so I'm not really qualified to comment as yet except on a theoretical basis.<br/>P.P.S. Although I\u2019ll carry on jumping into discussions on this and other forums, I\u2019m going to shift a lot of my everyday commentary (and most of my design announcements) to my blog, indiehippo.wordpress (which might eventually become simply indiehippo.com if I can afford Wordpress\u2019s fee to make that so).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392448/#Comment_392448" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T09:43:57+00:00" title="October  5, 2012  9:43AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2012 9:45AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must have missed your question about rolling 10-14 and up to 17 dice at a time.

If the range is too narrow, it penalises higher skill use because players with fewer skill points would not then suffer any more hardship than those with more.<br/> <br/><b>But 8-10 dice seems OK, I guess</b>. Well, if we have a dice pool at all- which we're pretty much committed to now- 8-10 is about the lowest average pool we can get away with without resorting to making a greater proportion of the roll having meaning. And that's not acceptable because a number of our playtesters have expressed concern at the high average levels of demerits per roll, which was what prompted me to suggest a change to d8s in the first place. <br/><br/>With smaller dice pools I'd have to go back to demerits at 1s and 2s on d6s, if not 1s, 2s and 3s, or 1s, 2s and 3s on d8s even, which would catch even more people in the 'demerits are too high' net.<br/><br/>\ufffc<a href="/forums/profile/Zachary">@Zachary</a>: <br/><b>So, from what I can tell, characters always succeed and the more skillful you are, the less dice you'll be rolling to potentially produce negative effects.

With the system as it is, at a given skill check, four things happen, in very short order:<br/>1. The player adds quality to attribute, 2. They refer to the conversion table  (which after a few times they've internalised) for a fraction of a second. <br/>3. They grab a handful of dice.<br/>4. They roll the dice. <br/>What's complicated about that? Also, any other system, whether it be a chart or a table, 2s being 1/2 a demerit, 6s cancelling out 1s etc. etc. would be way more complicated.<br/><b>what about demerits is fun and interesting? Let's say I roll and get six demerits - how are those interpreted by the fiction and how is it rewarding for the players?</b><br/>Oh, that's an easy one. I'll give you some examples from a recent scenario called A Very Merry Terran Xmas. The party had gone to a nursery to get an Xmas tree. Kraag, the super strength guy, rolled x4 dem, so although he was able to pull up the biggest tree very easily, unfortunately he managed to pull up most of the other trees with it. <br/><br/>Then Harok (enhanced senses) who was keeping watch, also rolled x4, so, although he didn't see or hear any cars coming from miles around, because he was only asked to check for approaching vehicles, and because he doesn't have eyes in the back of his head, failed to spot the sign saying 'This Section Reserved For Weber College Staff'. <br/><br/>Given the premise of the game, the players didn't even have to ask me who the big tree that Kraag had pulled up was reserved for. (Clue: the Dean!).<br/>In a previous session, a player had 'botaniported' (a quality the player had come up with himself) into a rose bush, at about the same time that the Dean's dog was being walked by a college servant. And what did the dog do? Well, suffice to say the PC was a bit wet afterwards. <br/><br/>So, if you like that kind of anarchic fun, trust me, the last thing you'll be thinking about while playing the game is whether or not all the dice will fit into your hand <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392824/#Comment_392824" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T07:21:19+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  7:21AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2012 3:50PM by catty_big.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted twice, <i>again</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392834/#Comment_392834" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T08:35:44+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  8:35AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2012 8:50AM by catty_big.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Zachary">@Zachary</a>:<br/>I hope my last post didn't sound as if I'm being intransigent.

To me, anything more than six dice in my hand is a large amount of dice. 17, though rare as you say, is a huge handful to me.</blockquote>\nYeah, I hear you. In order to answer that I think I should explain how the House Points work. As I said earlier, at a skill check, players convert their skill points to dice pool totals. If they\u2019re using their core qualities, they\u2019re rolling about 8-10 dice. If they can\u2019t use a core quality they\u2019ll be rolling more. However, they will be given House Points throughout the game (for awesome plot ideas and roleplaying) to spend on re-rolls and dice pool reduction, with 1HP reducing the pool by two and 2HP reducing it by three. After the roll, 1HP will allow them to re-roll only the demerits and 2HP the entire pool. <br/><br/>Now this means two things: first, they need to co-operate as a player party so that during the various tasks that go to make up their overall mission- if it\u2019s planning a party this will involve getting hold of supplies, both legal and illegal, ****ing over the Dean in some way and cooking up other cool shizz- they have to carefully work out where to go and what to do, and who should go on each errand such that core skills will be used most of the time. Secondly, they need to make optimum use of the HPS, of which they each have individual ones that they can burn, and a player party pile, which when used go to the GM to enhance his/her dice roll at the Epilogue. The system is thus very finely balanced so that a certain range of demerit totals is generated,  cool roleplaying is rewarded and no one needs to roll more than about ten dice during the entire game (if they don\u2019t <i>want</i> to; in a playtest on Tuesday one of the players was so enthused with the idea of the demerit narration that he was actually <i>trying</i> to roll high).<br/><br/>The only other factor is the three difficulty levels: time, location, and being spotted by a named NPC, which is what can potentially turn 14 dice into 17, but tbh I rarely apply them. I do penalise overuse of powers, but I tend do that by pre-adding demerits to the eventual total rather than adding dice to the pool. In fact, pre-loading demerits is something that we could use for the difficulty levels instead of adding dice, although the players seem to like the concept of dice being added, perhaps because it's something they can physically see happening.\n<blockquote>On the topic of demerits, I understand that they are interpreted into negative side-effects. But how? How does 4x turn into "so although he was able to pull up the biggest tree very easily, unfortunately he managed to pull up most of the other trees with it."<br/><br/>More importantly, how does the number of demerits affect the side-effect? How would that scenario be different if he rolled 3x or 5x demerits? That's what I mean by how are they interesting - what's the significance of each additional demerit?</blockquote>\nAh, now this is a very interesting question. Simply put, the demerit narration is fairly subjective. The demerit totals are mainly important for calculating the demerit dice that the GM rolls at the end of the game to determine the ultimate fate of Alien House, so there\u2019s no official table of how to narrate them. However, the average roll is 3.8, so if this is related to the five Final Outcome levels, a roll of 4 would be FO3, where AH is saved but only by a whisker. Five is a bit worse, and six is worst of all. Seven plus doesn\u2019t make the overall outcome much worse but will lead to an individual penalty for that PC even if AH is saved and gets to be in the parade etc. (In fact, I\u2019m considering making 7s automatic re-rolls).<br/><br/>Thus, the demerit narration is one of the challenges for the GM: they need to be able to come up with side effects that are both cool and sound reasonable for the level of the demerits rolled. A lot of the narration comes from the players themselves; when the first player asked me \u2018Can I narrate the complication?\u2019 I said \u2018Sure, go ahead\u2019 as it meant he was getting into the game and grokked the principle of it. Speaking to the example of the Xmas tree: in fact, that was perhaps a bit too much for 4 dem, but the player liked the idea so that was ok. With 3 dem he would probably only have pulled up one or two of the other trees, and with 1-2 dem he would have just left a few oversized footprints that would eventually be partially covered with snow so that although he would be strongly <i>suspected</i> of having been there it wouldn\u2019t have amounted to firm proof.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393126/#Comment_393126" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T12:04:42+00:00" title="October 11, 2012 12:04PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2012 12:11PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you'd like an objective opinion for constructive criticism, I don't believe that the current level of complexity is necessary to produce the results that you and your play-testers are finding enjoyable, but hey, if you like it that way, more power to you. If your goal is to create a system for you and your friends, cool beans. If your goal is to get players outside of your circle interested in your game, I would suggest finding a way to produce the same (or similar) enjoyable results without the large dice pools, point tracking and spending, and subjective nature of how demerits effect the fiction. The simpler the mechanics are, the easier it will be to facilitate the game and get to (what I understand is) the actual fun part - authoring the fiction influenced by the results of the mechanics.<br/><br/>Consider this - are the play-testers having fun because they like rolling a bunch of dice and spending points to re-roll or buy away extra dice?

There are plenty of dice systems that I actually do enjoy engaging with. A lot of people have championed the "System Matters" perspective. I would definitely advise against creating a dice system that people simply don't dislike.
