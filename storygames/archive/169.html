                    I mentioned elsewhere that I had that I had thought about playing Morrow Projest with Dogs rules. <br/>
For those of you who have forgotton the point of Morrw Project is that a crazy rich dude thinking the end was coming spent his millions to make hardened bunkers with which to house teams of soldiers to rebuild the country after the war. Sadly he fucked up and the teams over sleep fopr about 150 years and there is no central command. All of the teams must operate on their own.<br/>
The style should be about the same the team goes to a town which has gone all lord of the flies and the team must put things to right as they see it. Everyone wants something from the team and those things aren't allways compatible.<br/>
<br/>
My really big  first question is, if I don't change anything except the setting will the game work without the dogs being infallable? <br/>
<br/>
The little questions are <br/>
<br/>
would it work if the Blood relationship was the Team? they have lost everyone else. <br/>
<br/>
I was also considering some sort of occasional challenge faced by any member of the team to roll all of their relationship dice against "the Omega Man Syndrome", but I was wondering what could trigger this conflict?<br/>
<br/>
If I make radiation into a cool sort of challenge using the demonology rules would it be too one dimentional? <br/>
<br/>
Can Mutants be covered by the rules as is and still be interesting?<br/>
<br/>
Can there be a Heiarchy to explain bad communities like the sin development in Dogs?<br/>
<br/>
Anything you want to add?<br/>

                            Translating the "Hierarchy of Sin" is the big problem i see for any Dogs conversion. <br/>
<br/>
It might just be my personal philosophy, but the Sins really seem to need a "base of goodness" that has become corrupted - and can be uncorrupted with enough effort, enough sacrifice. I cannot quite see how that would work with a post-apocalyptic setting in which you're visiting *alien* communities. <br/>
<br/>
Have you thought about trying to build the "Sin tree" the other way around? Like, there is some big bad wrong in this place, and that leads to the place being in need of "saving" - and capable of being saved. I doubt that would look much like Dogs, however.                        </div>

<p><code>Falling away from good old american values - Then why do we need an apocolypse?</code></p>
<p>What about some kind of over the top twisted <em>ideal</em> of american values?  For instance;</p>
<p>The right to bear arms becomes:  <strong>Everyone must have a gun</strong></p>
<p>Free speech becomes:   <strong>Anyone who doesn't express themselves must be hiding something terrible.</strong></p>
<p>Consumerism becomes:  <strong>If you don't desire the things that other people have, then you must be a damned commie.</strong> (Or dirty ape, not sure)</p>
<p>I could even see the first stage of the sin tree as Pride still.  Only, this time, it's a <em>lack</em> of Pride that causes the probem.</p>

                            That's all cool but it isn't Morrow Project.  I only have counter examples, not constructive ideas, but I remember it as a potentially fascinating petri dish of disparate groups who, for one reason or another, SURVIVED.  The PCs make value judgments between groups of survivors, and the side they back wins, always.  "American values" is off track if this is what you are after.  But don't get too hung up on the Morrow thing, because a post-holocaust Dogs variant could go lots of ways.                        </div>

                            Jason, are communities defined by the things that they had to do to survive?  And the PCs show up to offer them an option that doesn't require the terrible, soul-scarring sacrifices that they've been making so far?  Sort of a "don't sacrifice the virgins to the dragon anymore, I'm here to kill the dragon"?                        </div>

                            No, there's absolutely none of that.  IIRC there's <em>nothing</em> in the game to address that, just canonical large groups that survived and thrived.  <br/><br/>I actually <em>playtested</em> the Morrow Project and own one of the 100 original, typed manuscripts.  We played the hell out of it, and it never made sense.                        </div>

                            Okay, what do you think about starting the "What's Wrong" tree with "How They Survived," then?<br/><br/><b>How They Survived:</b> They avoided the radiation by living underground, behind giant tanks of water.<br/><b>The Flaw:</b> There was only so much space underground.<br/><b>Injustice:</b> The elite of the community lived in the safest levels underground; the proles lived nearer or on the surface.<br/><b>Exploitation and Suffering:</b> As they were genetically damaged, the proles nearest the surface were sterilized.

                            What I was thinking is that the communities are disfunctional and the players are there to return them to the american way.<br/>
<br/>
I was fantasizing about  a game that instilled the values of good govenance in people but that might be too much to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Still the communities will want things from the team and be fucked up like the townies in Dogs.<br/>
<br/>
My initial thought was to take the government types list from traveller and use that as the first step in defining how wrong they were; but on second thought I like the idea of taking the bill of rights and looking at how a perversion of one of those rights would screw up a community.<br/>
<br/>
There are just so many ways you can screw up a community even without Mutants and Giant Ants.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is that the disaster wasn't Nuclear but something more biological and collapsy Like in Oryx and Crake.                        </div>
