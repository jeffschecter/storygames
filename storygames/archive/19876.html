Last time I posted a general, "<a href="http://schirduans.com/david/my-creations/mythic-mortals" rel="nofollow">Here's my game</a>!" Nonsense, when what I really wanted was the answer to this question, mostly because I've never seen or played anything like it.<br/><br/>In my new game, characters have constantly shifting powers and abilities. One minute you could have an awesome set of ranged attacks and powers, but in the next moment, you've been granted some powerful melee attacks.<br/><br/>Here are <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Frt380gw6h8woqvt%2FArchetype%2520Sheets.pdf%3Fdl%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAKf497t-8HGTmN3eA3jB4bqHdNg" rel="nofollow">some of the Classes</a> I've worked out so far.<br/><br/>You can see a table of 4x4 abilities. Your character's stats are made up of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Ff6jenfthjibmxms%2FPlayer%2520Mat.pdf%3Fdl%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjWrPc9pKa7D3sEgXUdBb3B3h5GQ" rel="nofollow">4 cards placed in 4 slots</a>, a la Castle Falkenstein.<br/><br/>As your stats change (every turn) your abilities shift as well. So if you have the 3 of hearts, 5 of diamonds, 8 of diamonds, and 2 of clubs on your mat, you count up the number of suits, and get that number of abilities for each suit. In this case, you have the top two Diamonds powers, the top Hearts, and the top Clubs. There are ALWAYS 4 powers active at any given time.<br/><br/>I guess my question is: How should powers be designed? I'm currently using the model:<br/>Top two columns are useful, 3rd column is very powerful, and 4th is over-powered nonsense (since players can rarely get those active for more than one turn per combat). Should powers be the result of different combinations instead? Should they be less game-breaking at the end? Or should I try and give players a little more stability with the powers that they have available?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440155/#Comment_440155" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T14:40:31+00:00" title="November 16, 2014  2:40PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtesting will answer all these questions, and more besides.

I would actually prefer that some powers just gave bonuses (which is normally boring game design because it doesn't open up for any interaction between the powers).<br/><br/>Your game text is all over the place and needs to be rewritten. You describe it in a sequential pattern when you could describe the whole process instead.

It went very well, everyone had a fun time. I think I've got the core rules and methodology complete. The biggest problems were with a few of the special abilities, which all need tweaking and re-working.\n<blockquote>Just want to throw in a short comment that the whole system feels really cool.

I've been revising and changing the rules without updating and re-writing the google doc. Over the next two weeks I will focus solely on re-writing the rules, showing examples, creating a GM, monster, and intro adventures section.<br/><br/>I'm really excited to get the ball rolling, and start fleshing out the content. Thank you so much for your encouragement! I am really excited about this game, and so far I haven't had a bad run.<br/><br/>A few things to note: The game does slow down sometimes, because there are so many choices, and players are meticulous about how they place their cards. It has the kind of strategy and puzzle solving that I wanted it to have. And, a recent discovery that I'l include: It works very well is players are placing cards in between their turns! that way, they stay engaged in the game while the other players take their own turns. I hope this keeps everyone playing and thinking, whether their character is acting, or the player is drawing and placing.<br/><br/>Thank you again! And let me know if you have any more suggestions or feedback. Soon I'll have a more polished version for you to try out for yourself!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
