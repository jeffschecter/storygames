Enter Chronica Feudalis, which can do the job nicely with only a few small tweaks.<br/> <br/>Q: Upon seeing Great Cthulhu waken from his slumber beneath R'yleh, my sanity shattered like an eggshell.  How does Chronica Cthudalis do that?<br/> <br/>A: By importing the Madness Meters from Unknown Armies/NEMESIS.  There are four kinds of madness-inducing stimuli: The Unnatural, Helplessness, Violence, and Self.  When confronted with a madness stimulus, you roll the appropriate skill against the strength of the stimulus: Will vs. Unnatural, Empathy vs. Helplessness, Sense vs. Violence, Command vs. Self.  If you fail, you get a failed notch in that meter, and must choose to fight, flee, or run.  If you succeed, you get a hardened notch in that meter.  If the rating of the stimulus is less than or equal to the number of hardened notches you have in the appropriate meter, you don't have to roll.  At character creation, characters must place one hardened notch and one failed notch in gauges of their choice; characters may get up to two extra hardened notches by taking up to two extra faileds.  Every time a character gets five failed notches, they gain a mental illness, which is an aspect like an injury that starts at d8.<br/> <br/>Not sure yet what the appropriate number of notches per madness meter is.  The obvious number is 6, which means each level will have its own die size.  That seems a little small, though.  Currently I'm leaning towards nine notches, distributed like so:<br/> <br/>The Unnatural (Will)<br/>\u2022 Hearing disembodied voices: Intensity 1 (d4)<br/>\u2022 Seeing an unattended object move: Intensity 2 (d6)<br/>\u2022 Being struck by an invisible attacker: Intensity 3 (d6)<br/>\u2022 Watching a vampire rise from the grave: Intensity 4 (d8)<br/>\u2022 Seeing a Deep One: Intensity 5 (d8)<br/>\u2022 Seeing a Serpent Man: Intensity 6 (d10)<br/>\u2022 Seeing an Elder Thing: Intensity 7 (d10)<br/>\u2022 Seeing a Shoggoth: Intensity 8 (d12)<br/>\u2022 Seeing a Great Old One: Intensity 9 (d20)<br/> <br/>Note that one could also simply have all madness rolls be against the default TN of 4, which might be a little closer to regular Call of Cthulhu and Unknown Armies, where the intensity of the check affects only the consequences, not the difficulty.  However, there aren't really any tools that can help with sanity rolls, and probably only a few appropriate aspects ("burning faith" vs. unnatural; "vicious killer" vs. violence, etc"; no aspect should be able to help with more than one madness meter); TN 4 might prove to be really difficult for a lot of characters if they're only rolling 1 die in a skill they don't use much.<br/> <br/>Q: I am an experienced Cthulhu: Dark Ages investigator who has survived several encounters with the horrors of the mythos.  How will you model my monstrous insight into the true nature of the universe, gleaned from blasphemous tomes and the counsel of unwholesome spirits?<br/> <br/>A: "Cthulhu Mythos" is a new skill.  You cannot put points into it at character creation; it starts at zero.  The first time a character reads a Mythos tome (or gets some other tutelage in the Mythos), they receive the skill at 1d4, provided that they have at least one failed notch in Unnatural.  After that, Cthulhu Mythos may be advanced as normal, subject to the following caveats: 1) you may not train yourself in Cthulhu Mythos, 2) each time you go up a level in Cthulhu Mythos, you must find a NEW tome or tutor to continue advancement, and 3) In order to advance Cthulhu Mythos to a given die type, you must have a number of failed notches in Unnatural equal to the rating of a stimulus with that die type.  That last was kind of confusing, so for example, to get d10 Cthulhu mythos, you must have at least 6 failed notches in the above scheme, because a d10 unnatural is intensity 6.<br/> <br/>Q: I am an evil wizard.  How will you model my dark sorceries?<br/> <br/>A: "Magic" is a new skill.  It is opened and advanced like Cthulhu Mythos, except that the max rank of magic is dependent on hardened, rather than failed notches in unnatural.  A spell is like a tool.  To learn a spell, you must first find a means of learning it (book, tutor, cthulhu, etc), then make a successful magic roll vs. the spell's die.  When you cast the spell, you roll your magic, and use the spell's rating as a tool.  Casting a spell is an unnatural stimulus with the same die type as the spell itself.  Spells like Shrivelling are simply resolved like normal attacks.  Magic is the attack skill; the spell is the weapon, and if you have an aspect "I am an evil wizard d8" then that's just gravy.  Other spells are effectively maneuvers, and put aspects on characters, objects, or scenes that help/hinder them, and affect the fiction (e.g. an aspect "I am flying" could let you Dash up out of sword range).<br/> <br/>Q: I am an abomination from beyond space and time.  How will you model my exalted strength and mysterious powers.<br/> <br/>Well, first we can give you a d20 to roll in a variety of stats.  Beyond that, Chronica Feudalis draws heavily on Agon and Spirit of the Century, so those are the go-to places to find cool powers.  I mostly looked at at Agon.  Monster powers involve breaking the rules available to PCs.  You can do this in the following ways: letting them attack or use or place aspects at unusual times, or by letting them replenish resources that can't usually be replenished, or deplete PC resources that can't usually be depleted.<br/> <br/>Here are my CF takes on a number of the Agon powers.<br/>Armor-piercing - armor can't be rolled against this attack<br/>Extra Damage - Treat a successful hit as a double success, and a double as a triple (and a triple as a quadruple, I suppose).<br/>Fear - Roll monster's Command vs. will; hits everyone WITHOUT the need to divvy up dice.  Losers take d6 "afraid" aspect on a success, d8 on a double, d12 on a triple.  Usable once per battle.<br/>Fiery form/spikes/whatever - This is an aspect. When hit, the monster immediately takes a free attack using this aspect to strike.<br/>First strike - this monster always wins initiative<br/>Gaze - gaze is a multiattack that hits all characters WITHOUT the need to divvy up dice.  Characters may look away to avoid, but they take a d6 "looking away" aspect.<br/>Reflect attack - when the monster deflects an attack with [choose active or passive] defense, the attack can be shunted onto another character; leave the attack roll as is.<br/>Life drain - when the monster damages a target, it regenerates that much vigor or reduces injuries that many steps.<br/>Multistrike - this monster can multistrike without handing out ardor points<br/>Poison - when this monster hits, it decrements an attack ability of its victim by one step for the duration of the battle<br/>Resurrection - The monster comes back when defeated unless its weakness is exploited.<br/>Transform - the NPC may set "transform opponent into (stone/animal/whatever") as stakes in a combat conflict.<br/>Rage - beast has a "rage" aspect that goes up a die size with each point of vigor it loses<br/>Ignore wounds - the beast's die pool does not reduce with vigor loss.<br/>Regeneration - the monster regenerates 1 vigor or reduces an injury by a die size every round(or every other round).  Injuries MUST be reduced to zero before it can heal vigor.<br/>Corrosive blood - a successful hit against the monster decrements your weapon by a die size.<br/><br/>I hope to play this in the next couple of weeks.  Any obvious pitfalls I'm missing here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254272/#Comment_254272" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T10:50:04+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 10:50AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't seen this yet, you might want to check out <a href="http://platonicsolid.blogspot.com/search/label/CF%20Fantasy%20Hack" rel="nofollow">Nathan Frund's blog</a> where he worked out some fantasy rules for CF.

I was somewhat leery of using existing skills for magic just to avoid simultaneously powering up an existing skill above its companions, and making it so that all wizards are really good at something random.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton" title="LaughingJackWilton"><img alt="LaughingJackWilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton">LaughingJackWilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254376/#Comment_254376" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T18:52:19+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  6:52PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your nine notch scale does not look out of place in CF *yoink* that is an awesome idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
