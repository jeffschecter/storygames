I'd like to hear what you all think.<br/><br/>It's about task resolution and "realism". Yeah, that's right! Run away! Ha.<br/><br/>If you're brave enough to keep reading, here we go:<br/><br/>First of all, what do I mean by "task resolution"? I mean resolution that considers the means of an action (Initiation, Execution) but does not factor in Intent, leaving Effect entirely in the hands of another player (typically the GM). It's not Intent Relevant.<br/><br/>What do I mean by "realism"? I mean that, when you're playing the game, the response the characters receives from the game world behave in a way that makes them feel kind of like real life.<br/><br/>So, here's the "question": Imagine you're playing an RPG, and you're playing this character, and he or she is engaged in one of those classic sort of task/conflict resolution scenes. You know what I mean, I'm sure--we've all had that nightmare.<br/><br/>There's a crowd of people. And you want to start a riot, so you decide to throw a rock at someone in the crowd. What happens now? If you're playing with Intent Relevant resolution/conflict resolution, the GM will be informed of your intent and then we will find out whether you get your way or not. That's a nice, functional model for gaming.<br/><br/>But, if the GM doesn't know what your Intent is, she's just going to have to make up something that happens in response. You may get what you wanted, you might not. But you might also get something completely different. Or you might get something different, and much better than what you might have tried to go for, in your limited purview.<br/><br/>My question is: is that second version kind of more, uh, "realistic"? I mean, it sounds more like my experience of real life, to me. That's how stuff _feels_ in the real world--you try something, but you're never even sure whether what you're doing will help you achieve your intent. You hope you're taking an action that will help you reach your goals, but sometimes you're wrong. Realism--real life--is just so darn unpredictable. Know what I mean?<br/><br/>So, does that make sense? Is it plain wrong? Does this thought stem from misconception? What do the S-G masses think? Is there something there that comes down to a gulf between real life and fiction/stories?<br/><br/>If there's some truth to that thought, are there other, more functional ways of getting the same effect? Tell us about some you've tried or experienced with some people you played with. <br/><br/>I'd love to hear about relevant actual play experiences--mechanics and techniques that give you that feeling or take it away from you, or (better yet), how some techniques can be twisted to work one way instead of the other...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136211/#Comment_136211" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T20:14:22+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  8:14PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure, but you might like to read <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.treasuretables.org/forum/index.php?topic=884.0" rel="nofollow">This Thread</a> i started awhile back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136213/#Comment_136213" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T20:25:23+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  8:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136216/#Comment_136216" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T20:53:16+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  8:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul!<br/><br/>First: You are assuming perfect communication of action to the GM (but in task resolution you have to be sure to describe exactly what you are doing, because, as you said, the GM has to guess), while the GM doesn't even ask you "why are you throwing that rock"? So it seems a rather "perfect" and hypothetical case, very difficult to get during a game. In my experience, usually the GM ask you what you want to do, THEN he tell you what task and what roll to use, to avoid this confusion.<br/><br/>Second: if you are using task resolution, it's probable (not 100% certain, but probable) that you are playing a game where the GM has already a plot in mind. Usually they are very predictable. So what you get throwing the rock is usually "nothing at all" or "what the GM wanted to happen happen now!" or "someone make you stop throwing rocks so that the story can go on".<br/><br/>So, no, I don't think it more "realistic". You are exchanging your decision (intent) to the GM's decision, and calling the confusion and miscommunication that will happen as "more realistic" is akin to consider a result from a rolled die "more realistic" that a decision by a GM because instead of considering the more realistic outcome, the die could give wild implausible results, considered "more realistic" because they can happen 0.0001% of  times.<br/><br/>If you want a "realistic" outcome, I think that you will get better results by (1) reaching an agreement between you and the other players (GM included) about what exactly is "realism" for you, and (2) sticking to it when someone has to choose an effect. If you don't want to choose, the GM can do it, but to choose what is more "realistic" he still has to get all of the information about what you are doing, without relying on confusing task statements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136217/#Comment_136217" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T20:54:15+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  8:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2008 7:01AM by Dave Younce.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>But, if the GM doesn't know what your Intent is, she's just going to have to make up something that happens in response.

More often, you get GM intent, or GM guess of player intent, or intentional GM thwarting of guess of player intent, and so forth.  So it doesn't usually bend towards realism. There may be groups out there where the GM will completely objectively interpret each stated player action, I've just never seen such a thing.<br/><br/>edit: Crossposted with Moreno                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136219/#Comment_136219" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T21:01:57+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  9:01PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2008 9:02PM by Andy.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cross-posted with EVERYONE!

Is there something there that comes down to a gulf between real life and fiction/stories?</blockquote>\nIt might be misconception or whatever, but I definitely feel this is the gulf between real life and fiction.<br/><br/>Frex, in a Conan game I ran, Alan, one of the players, kept doing "strange things" (actually he does this all the time). What I mean by that is this.<br/>*characters are in a desert*<br/>Alan: "I begin looking for rocks, like fist sized or bigger."<br/>Me: "Huh?"<br/>Alan: "Yeah, I figure we're in a desert and all, but I want to look for rocks."<br/>Me: "Uhhh, nope. No rocks." (I visualized the desert in my minds eye, and there were no rocks in my mind, thus no rocks to be found. I could have just made a high Senses roll or something).<br/>Alan: "Oh... ok, nevermind then".<br/><br/>And this kind of thing will go on for a bit, usually with different activities. So what I realized he was doing was trying to, in character, describe a task that was actually the beginning of a lead-up to a kind of either extended task or conflict even. In the scene above (which really happened, BTW), I ended up continuing the conversation, at that point finally clicking that "Alan's trying to Do Something, he's not just fucking around. So let's get to the bottom of this."<br/><br/>Me: "So what are you trying to do?"<br/>Alan: "I'm just seeing if there are rocks around, that I could examine..."<br/>Me: "No, I mean, why are you looking for rocks? What do you want to do with them, <b>what's the goal here</b>?"<br/>Alan: "Oh, I just wanted to check for moisture trappings to see if they would, like, point us to moisture."<br/>Me: "No shit! OK, maybe mention that next time. Sure, make a Survival roll then."<br/>(rolls, succeeds)<br/>Me: "Yeah, you actually go to the bottom of a dune with an odd shape, and surmise that there are rocks underneath."<br/>(over the next few minutes, he in-character digs up and examines the rocks, telling the other PCs in-character what he's doing, and I respond to that, filling out the scene).<br/><br/>So for me, you Gotta Know the Intent. You just Gotta. Else you'll be talking past each other, as a GM thinking that this player keeps fucking around with side-shit that doesn't matter, and a Player thinking that none of his ideas are cool enough to the GM to be played out or realized. Once you know what the final telos/goal is, you can decide from there how to get from A to B: Incite a riot with a charismatic speech? Incite a riot with a Disguised Rock-Throw? Incite a riot with your Connections, nodding to the guards under your payroll, who nod back and begin hitting the civillians? You can chose a million ways to get to that goal, and more reasons to succeed or fail at it (and what happens in success and failure), but the character has to tell us, the audience, what she's trying to do.<br/><br/>If you're all Jeepform, maybe you can mumble out the side of your mouth in character, "Maybe if I throw a few rocks from the shadows, I could start a riot. Hmmmm."\n<blockquote>That's how stuff _feels_ in the real world--you try something, but you're never even sure whether what you're doing will help you achieve your intent. You hope you're taking an action that will help you reach your goals, but sometimes you're wrong.</blockquote>\nThat is exactly what the dice are for. If you make the goal clear, and decide what you're going to do to get there (be it one task, 3 tasks, 5 tasks), roll them dice. If you succeed, it will help you reach your goals, and if it didn't you were wrong! <br/><br/>In the "rocks in a riot" example, you (GM) could narrate the ourcome in so many ways it's not even funny.<br/>If you make that goal clear, and agree on a single Throwing Roll to make it happen:<br/>Success: "You hit a person in the head, who goes down like a ton of bricks. The person next to him starts screaming, and with his friends surge forward."<br/>Success: "You narrowly miss the person you were aiming for, but your rock hits the wall, shattering with a loud bang! The people you were aiming at stand mouths agape at the narrow miss "from the policeman's bullet" and surge forward."<br/>Failure: "You miss, and hit the guy in the shoe. He stumbles, and continues his conversation in angry tones with the policeman."<br/>Failure: "You hit the guy, who screeches and backs up. A couple of his friends help carry him limping off, shouting epithets at the police. Looks like they were just too weak-willed to fight".<br/><br/>So yeah, state the goals is step one. Step two is someone (the GM, primarily) learning to describe the events of task resolution as something other than simple Hit or Whiff.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136238/#Comment_136238" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T04:09:24+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  4:09AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>My question is: is that second version kind of more, uh, "realistic"?

Know what I mean?</blockquote>\nIt feels more realistic from the characters point of view. It has little to do with "realism" itself on grander scale, but if your goal is to get the gut-feeling of "this is how  this fictional person might feel in this fictional environment" (Id' call that character immersion, but I'm not sure if you're looking for that same thing), that's the best solution I've seen so far.<br/><br/>I don't think it's about reaching or assuming perfect communication between player and GM - pretty much the opposite. The illusion (there, that's a loaded term) of realism from the players part comes from not going to conflict-resolution (I want to start a riot), because you're not really able to determine the outcome of the action you're trying to do. Your character cannot do that, and nor could you, in real life. All you can do is throw the rock, tell what you want to achieve with that action, and act on the results. Obviously, there some movement space on stating the intention of that action.<br/><br/>Now, as stated, you're pretty much giving away all the control of that action. First, the communication is far from perfect (you're stating an action, not the desired outcome), and secondly, as far as you know, the GM could have decided the result beforehand. But since you are limiting your point-of-view to the character, it does not really matter. You only perceive your own actions and their consequences, as described by someone.<br/><br/>Now, if it DOES matter, problems arise, and you end up in situtation that Moreno, Dave, and Andy are proposing. If you want to affect the outcome of an action, or go straight to the conflicts and determine wheter what you (the player) want to happen, you are already stepping out from the point-of-view of the character and dabbling with things that you, as yourself, throwing a rock into crowd, can not control. I don't think it has anything to with the "feeling of realism", observed chaos and unpredictability and all that, but it gives you better tools on how to simulate the actions. But that's different kind of realism.<br/><br/>As a further thought, in an envinroment with no GM and where every fictional person is represented by a physical one, it suddenly works realistically on both levels.<br/><br/>(Haven't fully read Rust's thread when posting this)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136240/#Comment_136240" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T05:11:15+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  5:11AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem is that the GM doesn't know what realistic is. In real life total insane things can happen wich noone would believe. That could of course be simulated by randomizers, so if you roll a d100 (or d1000 or anything) you still can have 1% chance that the stone bounces back and hits you in your face. That's realistic literally.<br/><br/>If you want solutions that sound like they would be realistic, that's totally up to the common sense of the GM. The problem with this that this isn't realism, this is just plain boring fiction. Because it isn't random and patterns arise even unintentionally. You can only evade these patterns by using randomizers.<br/><br/>But if you are making up fiction with patterns and so on, that means that you still can have realistically sounding things, but it has no sense. The writers don't bother being 'realistic', the writers bother to make up good stories. So you shouldn't bother about realism yourself in this case, but should think about what type of fiction do you need - wich is a totally different topic.<br/><br/>BUT some level of realism does exist in fiction, too. For example you know that your heroes won't die on the shuttle when they are nearing the Endor moon. But when the battle breaks out, that makes it realistic, that even heroes could die. Of course this isn't real realism, that's just another pattern wich plays with the sense of realism, the common sense of the audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh" title="Gorsh"><img alt="Gorsh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh">Gorsh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136247/#Comment_136247" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T06:01:18+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  6:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2008 6:06AM by Gorsh.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ( This is <i>my</i> thread... )<br/><br/>I usually GM in that way ( task resolution, aiming for realism, judging task\xb4s achievement of intent in terms of plausibility - hi Dave, i <i>do</i> exist <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ), or i used to, when i GMed trad games. The mechanics being as they are, i usually hate the fact that i command a power i don\xb4t want to have, the power to mess with Intents without much guidance from the system to apply any rule but my "common sense". In many "important rolls" ( dangerous things to characters, final roll to get the "thing" chars wanted ) this objectivity ( which of course, doesn\xb4t really exist, and it\xb4s only a guideline to my/our choices ) is very hard to apply, because the plausibility factor gets trumped by the weight of the stakes involved in the conflict. <br/>I think most trad games rules don\xb4t deal with this problem because they assume you\xb4ll be using this power to "run the story" or other euphemisms of Illusionist GMing; to their mindset, why would someone cede that steering wheel?<br/><br/>So, to the questions:<br/><br/>Yes, i do believe it sustains the feeling of realism by being less predictable. In real life, one usually goes to a certain extent to minimize this unpredictability: researching, planning, etc.; either that or one knows that is just gambling with luck, and only takes that route when a little desperate or when the task cannot be adequately foreseen.<br/><br/>Mechanics - techniques: Following from above, i always ask Intent in those cases, and then i usually ask or at least give the option for knowledge and perception rolls before attempting it, as long the task\xb4s chances of success could be foreseen somehow. That Know/Per roll, if succesful on it\xb4s own terms, allow you to peek into the GMs "common sense" plausibility answer beforehand, without the consequences of actually trying.<br/><br/>In the classic "dirt in the vault" example, i\xb4d judge if the dirt would be there objectively ( ideally, i\xb4d create this fact before they say they go to open it, independently ), but my characters would either have researched if the dirt would be there or be ready to find it empty, as they knew they were just trying a long shot. In your "incite a riot" example, however, i wouldn\xb4t have found any relevant roll ( except the character was a "riot control specialist" or had some way of knowing a pertinent skill... unlikely ) and would just allow you to try, while i attempt to abstract away the likeliness of the desired outcome. But you, in that specific contract, would know that trying this sort of things may or may not give the outcomes wanted, and would abide that. <br/><br/>Now, if my common sense weren\xb4t enough to judge and/or the roll would be too important to impose pressure on me, i might use some sort of "luck" roll ( Call of Cthulhu has it, Cyberpunk sort of does too ). So if i couldn\xb4t judge if the vault contains something important based on common sense alone, it would be a matter of good luck on the character\xb4s part for something to be there. This doesn\xb4t completely convinces me, because it creates an unrealistic variable ( fortune, destiny ) in a setting that doesn\xb4t have one ( would be perfectly fitting in a Star Wars game, where we could significate it as a whim of the Force ).<br/><br/>Do<i> I</i> make any sense now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136262/#Comment_136262" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T07:56:18+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  7:56AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The question for me is not, should we ignore intent and just perform actions and see what happens, because that way lies boring and pointless gaming, but does the *how* matter along with the *why*? <br/><br/>To me it does. It's not good enough for me to know that you want to start a riot, I care about how you start a riot too. In most task resolution games that I have run it is always like that. You may roll to perform a task, but everyone knows what you are trying to achieve with it as well. I know that you threw the rock to start a riot, rather than to stop someone talking, and will interpret the result differently. Frankly I think almost everyone uses task resolution like this, even if they are not thinking about it. See how odd Andy's example looks, specifically because he doesn't know the intent behind the tasks. Mostly we don't do things that way. <br/><br/>So task resolution doesn't have to ignore intent, and neither does *realism*, because usually what realism means is that you have to think about the task you will resolve to get your intent. You want to start a riot, throwing a rock is a realistic way, as opposed to, say, just willing there to be a riot, or whatever would be unrealistic in your game.<br/><br/>Graham Walmsley ran a fantastic game of Mutant City Blues at Conpulsion where you saw that in action. We knew we would get the clues we needed by paying points from out investigative pools, that was a given, but the *how* was important too. Sometimes we knew the obvious way but didn't have the skill available, and had to jump through hoops to find another way, that was the realism bit. For example we wanted to decipher a computer disk. We could have done that with 1 point of Cryptanalysis, but we didn't have it. So we had to use 1 point of Cop talk to find an analyst to use it, and a point of bureaucracy to make them work faster, and so on and so on. That was about finding a realistic way to fulfill intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/steven807" title="steven807"><img alt="steven807" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/steven807">steven807</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136274/#Comment_136274" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T09:41:38+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  9:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2008 12:54PM by steven807.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll mention that IaWA (and Sorcerer, from what I hear) handles things in yet another way.

Once you know what the final telos/goal is, you can decide from there how to get from A to B: Incite a riot with a charismatic speech? Incite a riot with a Disguised Rock-Throw? Incite a riot with your Connections, nodding to the guards under your payroll, who nod back and begin hitting the civillians? You can chose a million ways to get to that goal, and more reasons to succeed or fail at it (and what happens in success and failure), but the character has to tell us, the audience, what she's trying to do.</blockquote>\nHm.  As a player, I've had two opposite problems with intent.  Certainly I have seen what Andy posted -- i.e. The player doesn't say clearly what he is trying for, and the GM shoots down his intent without realizing it.  However, I just as often see the opposite -- where the players do tell the GM what they are trying, and in an effort to make it challenging, the GM deliberately throws obstacles in the way of them getting what they want.  This is very explicit in the case of a game like <b>Capes</b>, where the player can accomplish absolutely anything through narration <i>except</i> what her defined goals are.  This is not the GM being a jerk per se -- they are trying to deliver a good game, and in my experience the urge to challenge players is just as strong in story games GMs as in more traditional ones.  <br/><br/>This was discussed recently in the a Burning Wheel forums thread, <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5726" rel="nofollow"> <b>"Different Ways to Approach Intent"</b> </a>.  However, it was also a very old issue, discussed at times on rec.games.frp.advocacy as part of simulationist discussion.  I remember in particular Mary Kuhner describing a Shadowrun GM who genuinely believed the adage "no plan survives contact with the enemy".  If he knew the players plans, he would make sure something went wrong -- and the players quickly realized that if they planned in secret, their plans went off more smoothly.  <br/><br/>As a player, I don't feel strongly either way.  Either approach has problems, but either case can also go smoothly.  <br/><br/>The important thing isn't really in intent, but in finding ways to head off assumption clash.  The more players and GM jointly understand what the situation is and how game resolution works (both in the game world and in mechanics), the better.  As a GM, if I'm confident that the players know the situation, then I rarely feel a need to ask intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136493/#Comment_136493" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T10:37:25+00:00" title="March 26, 2008 10:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for your feedback!<br/><br/>I think everyone's on board with this, but just in case someone isn't:<br/><br/>There are two separate issues that relate to "realism" being discussed here. One is, "Do the events described in my game make sense/have verisimilitude?" The other is, "Does the player feel like they're in a 'real' fictional world?"

Any more examples?<br/><br/>In my own game, <i>Land of Nodd</i>, the player names a positive consequence to their actions (their intent), and other players (usually not the GM) name negative consequences, with the randomizer pre-selecting certain combinations. I really like the very unpredictable nature of conflict resolution under that system--the outcome of a conflict or scene very quickly sort of "twists" out of any single player's control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136539/#Comment_136539" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T12:48:31+00:00" title="March 26, 2008 12:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>The first question is _not_ what I was asking about.

The system only say who has the upper hand and can "hurt" the other, if he can't negotiate another outcome. It was called in another thread "conflict domination" and I think that its a good name. And I think that the same name can be applied to the Sorcerer conflict rules, that work on a similar principle (you don't get what you want, you get bonus dice and a changed situation)<br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday do the same thing, inside the Bringing Down the Pain.  <br/><br/>Other systems have conflict resolution rules that don't resolve "stakes" but only force a positive/negative outcome, leaving the details to someone who get to narrate the outcome (who can be always the GM, If your "immersive players" dislike narrating the outcomes).<br/><br/>So, all in all, I don't think that task resolution give you really anything over these systems. The problem you cite is caused by explicit stakes, not by the conflict resolution by itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136547/#Comment_136547" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T13:19:18+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  1:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2008 1:24PM by komradebob.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, without some clue about intent, a GM might continuously give you unrealistic results as well.

The player can therefore carry out the intent step in their own head ("I want things to go this way, so I will pick out this effect.") OR they could SKIP THE (conscious) INTENT STEP and just stream-of-consciousness/channel the effect. So "freeform," and sorta Wushu and Polaris sorta work this way, although they have ways to block (although the block is on the effect level.
