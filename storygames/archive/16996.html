I used a modified version of Over the Edge, which of course I hacked more as I went along. The main thing was that there were six areas of competency for Starfleet officers:<br/><br/>Command/Diplomacy<br/>Combat<br/>Medical<br/>Science<br/>Engineering<br/>Piloting<br/><br/>I was very happy with these divisions, and they really felt right, even though in many games it would be odd for, say, science and engineering to be separate, or for command and diplomacy *not* to be separate.<br/><br/>Anyway, each character had two dice in four things, three dice in their secondary thing, and four dice in their main thing*. It was a simple task resolution system and many of the difficulties were reasonably low, say around 5-7 IIRC, reflecting the fact that Starfleet officers are really fucking competent and well-trained.<br/><br/>The game was very successful and fun and I've been thinking about running it again, but of course I'd want to update the system to reflect current design trends. (Not because of vogue but because I genuinely like those trends.) For instance, Trek seems to have a whole lot of "7-9 results" in it, and I'd love to capture that feel.<br/><br/>To do a Trekpocalypse World game, I was thinking about having a spread of 5 or so stats, as usual, ranging from -1 to +2, also as usual. But, to keep the optimistic, competent feeling, each officer can roll 3 dice and keep the 2 highest in whatever their niche is\u2014the Captain on Command/Diplomacy, the Doctor on Medical, etc. But you can still be pretty good at things outside your niche, just based on your stats, which, again, is what we see on the show.<br/><br/>Or, to make it more PTA-ish, maybe you only get the 3rd die in your main thing a few times per session?<br/><br/>Ooooh, or, another idea: keep my original system more or less intact, but be harsher/more consistent with task DCs, and give 7-9 results if you fail by 4 or less.<br/><br/>Oh man, now I am remembering the reasonably cool but probably somewhat ridiculous starship combat system I wrote (with the help of one of my players who's also math-y). I'm so into the idea of the ship having a "harm chronometer," with the possibility of taking debilities to offset damage. "Looks like they took out the warp drive again."<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*I also had this system for specialties within one of the six main areas, like Shuttle Piloting, Temporal Mechanics, Transporter Engineering, First Contact, etc. This granted an extra die on top of your normal one, allowing truly prodigious feats in your specialty area.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386420/#Comment_386420" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-05T19:58:52+00:00" title="August  5, 2012  7:58PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, basic stats and moves for Trek?<br/><br/>Some initial, very hastily thrown together thoughts:<br/><br/><b>Stats:</b><br/>Gravitas<br/>Charming<br/>Brilliant<br/>Persistent<br/>Decisive<br/><br/><b>Basic Moves:</b><br/>Jury-Rig Tech (Brilliant)<br/>Investigate A Scientific Anomaly (Brilliant)<br/>Attack An Enemy (Decisive)<br/>Orate About Morality (Gravitas)<br/>Lead/Execute Complicated Plan (Persistent)<br/>Befriend (Charming)<br/><br/>Note that Brilliant gets two moves to emphasize the primacy of intellect in the Trek-verse, while the others get one each. I foresee some stat-swapping, though I want to prevent characters who roll one thing all the time, obviously.<br/><br/>The playbooks are pretty much just the main roles on a Starship. Captain (Gravitas), Doctor (Persistent), Engineer (Brilliant), Security (Decisive), Science (Brilliant). The First Officer is sort of a chameleon class, and can emphasize whichever stat he chooses.<br/><br/>Mostly I just want to roll +Gravitas to Orate About Morality.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
