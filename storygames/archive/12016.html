And while I've had this issue from time to time as a player in those games, it really came to light more when I started playing these new-fangled story games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere it is: I have a lot of trouble figuring out what my character wants in the game, and I sort of get "lost" in the story.  Part of it is that (with my old GM instincts), I get caught up a lot more in the planning of the setting or scenario (especially in something like Fiasco or PTA), and I never really figure out who I am as a character.  And even when I have what I think is a pretty strong character concept, a lot of times it turns out to be a lot more internally focused, rather than something that can come out and be resolved through play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, do y'all have any advice or tricks to help me out?  Is it just a matter of experience (which I'd love to have more opportunity to gain), or do I need to think a different way about my approach to these games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268869/#Comment_268869" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T13:58:20+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  1:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make your character want something that only another character or adventuring can provide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268877/#Comment_268877" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T15:43:19+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  3:43PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two things that make interesting characters are desires and conflicts.

It isn't really all that bad in general, but story games are collaborative and social, and it's hard to entertain other players if your focus is internal.  I've had a very fun game where the principal joy for me was working out the character's internal state, and the principal joy for the other players was seeing what ludicrous conclusion I'd come to, but that character was special in a lot of ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268881/#Comment_268881" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T16:28:21+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  4:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you have a hard time coming up with what your character wants, it may very well be that your character wanted something in the past, and was badly burned by it, and now is a cynic. Noir detective stories often have protagonists that <i>claim</i> not to want anything, and even appear to do so at the beginning of the story. But their actions prove differently.  Around halfway through the story you (and sometimes they) realize that if they really didn't want anything, if they really didn't care, they would just take the bribe, pack it in and go drink themselves to death. So don't feel like you have to come up with something right away.  Play for a while, then look back and enjoy the realization that who they are is not who they claim they are, or even perhaps who you claimed they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268884/#Comment_268884" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T16:54:47+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  4:54PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>So don't feel like you have to come up with something right away.

You might pick something for your character to <i>think</i> they want and then keep an eye out for something to crop up in the fiction that serves as a more interesting motivation. Being in tune with your real-life emotions can be a big help here. If you find yourself feeling all warm and fuzzy inside because Dave's character paid yours a compliment, then why not run with that and decide "My guy <i>claims</i> he wants money and power, but deep down what he <i>really</i> wants is Dave's characters approval."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268903/#Comment_268903" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T21:43:06+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  9:43PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't tried it before, look at playing a game using the <i>Solar System</i>, or something like <i>Lady Blackbird</i>.  Using Keys for character development is a really good way to focus how you think about your character's growth, and how your choices and actions are directly related to that.  It's also good because those Keys are flags for everyone to see, so other players can help by pushing against your Keys or providing situations where they're relevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268931/#Comment_268931" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T05:16:29+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  5:16AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may be controversial, but I say screw motivation as the Holy Grail of characterisation.<br/><br/>I've been in more than one game that was driven into the ground by one player sacrificing everyone else's enjoyment in order to preserve his conception of his character. In those extreme cases, it was because the character concept they came up with a priori was one that was poisonous to productive play. I've been in games where the concept has been less destructive, but an obstacle to running the game rather than an asset.<br/><br/>I'd go further than Jason and Ron- start with as much of a blank as you can get away with, and let the details come in play. Why? Because if you make a big decision about character at the start it makes additional work for the GM to weave it in, and risks it lying fallow if he doesn't manage to. If you seize on something that crops up in play, that aspect is already an integral part of the story with no additional work. And, because the other players have been exposed to it in play, they're more likely to build on it themselves than if it was just written in background notes or kept secret.<br/><br/>In general, I find that picking your moments to do something characterful and making them count is more effective than trying to be 'in character' all the time, particularly with a large group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268946/#Comment_268946" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T07:42:37+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  7:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Come at it from the other direction. So much of story games play focuses on the interaction of what characters want from each other, but instead of looking at what others characters have and focusing your wants on them, look at what they want and be willing to have your character have it. If your character is reluctant to share, that,s even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: Mike's DRYH character's path is to get off drugs and find a comfortable suburban life with a nice boring guy. So make your character that boring suburbanite, and better yet, make him reluctant to share his life again due to loss or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the best characters are another character's wish fulfillment, or adversary, or both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268958/#Comment_268958" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T08:35:42+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  8:35AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2010 8:41AM by Wordman.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moderation in any of these tips is key. To much of any technique, or rigidly applying one, is toxic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, everyone is different. Advice the works for some won't work for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not the world's greatest role-player, either, but I've tried the following at one time or another. One might work for you:<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point, I tried to run characters based on certain philosophies (or pseudo-philosophies), so any time I didn't know what to do, I could think "what would Kant say in this situation". One of my more successful Shadowrun characters, for example, was built based applying (and misapplying) the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6zJvPwAACAAJ" rel="nofollow">Tao of Pooh</a>. The approach obviously depends on how much you are into philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are proxies for the above strategy. A common one is to based your characters personality on a specific person or fictional character. "What would <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.genesimmons.com/" rel="nofollow">Gene Simmons</a> do in this situation?".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother type of "choose a philosophy" is actually the clunky old alignment system from D&amp;D.; "What would a Lawful Neutral ideal do in this situation". The best part of doing this is that, since you can pretty must use any alignment to justify any behavior, making this really work forces you to choose what <i>your character</i> thinks "Lawful Neutral" means, and that exercise is halfway to knowing how the character will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother approach is the "detailed history" approach. This can be overdone and only helps a certain type of player, but sometimes knowing the character's past makes some choices about decisions in their present obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea that helped me was in some variation of a Storyteller game. (Not sure is this was really in the game or a house rule, but it worked.) The idea was to select two things from a list of archetypal personality types (like "Explorer", "Bureaucrat", "Martyr", etc.) The first was the characters true nature. The second was the face they presented to the world. Now, picking these archetypes is, in itself, nothing all that interesting, but the way that the two interacted tells you a lot about how the character lies to himself, interacts with other people and, importantly, weaknesses and flaws in his personality. Not everyone's bag, but it made my characters more interesting to play (and, I hope, play with).<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that all of these techniques are (intentionally) "introspective". Since you say you tend to be drawn that way anyway, one of these might help redirect your natural instincts. The important thing is really to use them to figure out what <i>other people</i> see your character do. You have to filter a lot of this stuff through thoughts about other people. That is, not "what am I going to do" so much as "how will I help this person? Will I help this person?" "Another guy is doing something, is that OK?" "How do I get that person to do this?" "What about this guy do I respect?" The idea is that all this virtual navel-gazing informs a sort of "instinct" about <i>why</i> your character would zig instead of zag in a particular interaction with some other character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GamerChris" title="GamerChris"><img alt="GamerChris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GamerChris">GamerChris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268988/#Comment_268988" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T11:15:47+00:00" title="April 26, 2010 11:15AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks already to everyone who has given advice!  These suggestions have definitely given me some new techniques to figure out "who" I am.<br>\n<br>\nAnd like I said, I think that it's mainly my relative inexperience as a player, especially in player-agency games, that is causing me trouble.  And sometimes I also fall into the "think of something cool" trap, rather than just coming up with something workable and then seeing where it goes in play.  So I tend to either think too much and have an insular character who doesn't fit into the emerging story, or a "blank slate" that doesn't get interesting until 2/3 of the way in.  But hopefully, some of this advice will help me break through the trouble that I've been having.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269014/#Comment_269014" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T14:42:46+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  2:42PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Relax and smoke some pot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269018/#Comment_269018" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T15:27:12+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  3:27PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Focus and drink some coffee, preferably laced with cheap brandy and accompanied by countless cigarettes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269020/#Comment_269020" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T15:39:57+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  3:39PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I highly recommend Graham's book, <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/49" rel="nofollow">Play Unsafe</a>.

One where you don't have any agency other than by your character's actions. That actually removes a lot of temptation to fix things on a bigger level and leave your character just a pawn. There are nice bits in Solar System, but if you want to think "what I'm gonna do to achieve a cool life" rather than "what is my character going to do to keep things interesting", I'd suggest something far more traditional. But I'm not sure if that's what you really want to do.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, take some side of your own personality and concentrate on that - don't take a character too far removed from your own personality. I played quite a simple thug in a WFRP game and it was a success. The most important thing I did was just childishly expressing in-game all that aggression and frustration that I normally can't do IRL. With my Solar System character I've just taken my laconic tendencies to an extreme, and when the character is drunken he acts pretty much like I do after a couple of beers. Putting yourself in the situation your character is in is seriously a good start.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269496/#Comment_269496" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T15:09:53+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  3:09PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to consider is simply lowering the bar for complexity when it comes to what your character wants, especially at the beginning -- pick really obvious, simple things, and don't worry about why you want them. The first time something in play strikes your fancy -- just go after it. Then, when you see how that turns out, think about why -- was there something in how your character went after it, what he did once he had it (or failed to get it), that suggests more about his motivation? Maybe, maybe not -- but if you do this five or six times a pattern will probably emerge. Even if the pattern turns out to be 'my character wants the things I am interested in as a player' -- that's still something to think about, and develop in future play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269499/#Comment_269499" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T15:34:22+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  3:34PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad you posed this question as it plagues me too.
