Culture Clash is a game that's <i>about</i> how the culture we live in shapes our ability to act in the world. Players will split up into teams. Each team is a separate culture.  Each PC in a given culture operates under a set of Culture Stories that describe what is/is not appropriate for that PC -- essentially stereotypes.  Some of these are positive ("Everyone in Culture X is a great dancer") but most are negative ("Fishermen in Culture X are terrified of dogs")<br/><br/>Here's the catch -- You can't buy stories for your Culture, only for another one. So other players will define the stereotypes (good and bad) that your character labors under.<br/><br/>When your guy goes to do something, the obstacle has nothing to do with "reality" and everything to do with the difficulty of the story you're trying to beat. So if the wall is 500' high and covered with grease, you've got a great chance to climb it if there's a cultural story that says "yeah, we're great climbers" and if your guy needs to add 1 plus 1, but there's a story that says "Men can't do math", he's going to have a much harder time of it.<br/><br/>The cultures in the game are coming into conflict over a resource.  The PCs either enter challenges to gain resources or they enter challenges to invest the resources they've gained into changing their culture (this is how you can change the stories for your culture).  When the resources run out, cultures are evaluated and a winner determined.<br/><br/>That's the gist.  The game got some playtesting at the last JiffyCon, it's been through some refinement and it's ready for more.  I've made up a batch of playtest copies (not ashcans, they're not nearly complete/pretty enough for that) to give to interested parties at Gen-Con.  I'm also hoping to be able to run a playtest session or two after-hours at GenCon.<br/><br/>So if you're interested in giving it a look or trying it out, you can drop me a note here.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Tom                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161943/#Comment_161943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-11T08:55:59+00:00" title="August 11, 2008  8:55AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tom, what's the numeric range of players and how long does it typically take?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TomR" title="TomR"><img alt="TomR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomR">TomR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161971/#Comment_161971" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-11T11:19:16+00:00" title="August 11, 2008 11:19AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At least 3 (one GM, 2 players), and the system supports/encourages one player running multiple PCs, but it should scale up to 5-7 players pretty easily.<br/><br/>  At the playtest I had 2 players (joined later by a 3rd) with a total of 6 PCs and we ran through a fair amount of stuff in about 2-3 hours.  We didn't reach the end of the game, but that was mostly because I hadn't quite worked out what the end of the game was supposed to be.  Now I've got an endgame, but how many sessions it would take to reach it?  I'm not sure.  If you only had three players and worked with a small Heap (the timer that determines the game end), You might be able to run a complete game in one 3-4 hour session.  It'd be really short though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162075/#Comment_162075" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-11T15:27:26+00:00" title="August 11, 2008  3:27PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Tom, you already knew I want to play this more, but here's reminding you.
