                            Uh, I am not sure what your definition of MIS means.  How can a group think something?  It doesn't seem to clarify between the two different meanings of "Shared" that have been discussed in the other thread.  I think we need a venn diagram here.                        </div>

                            Also, can we talk about MIS? I totally don't get why it's a thing. There are two possible formulations of MIS and neither of them make sense to me:<br/><br/><b>MIS-union:</b> Sandra says that MIS is the union of all PIS. That is, it's the superset of what everyone thinks the Game State is, or the superset of all PIS. If each player's PIS is a circle, and the circles overlap somewhat, then MIS-union is all three circles colored in.<br/><br/><b>MIS-intersection:</b> I mistakenly thought it was this, only the bits of the PIS that everyone shared in common. That is, if each player's PIS is a circle, and the circles overlap somewhat, then MIS-intersection is the small part in the middle that all circles have in common.<br/><br/>But neither seems useful at all to me.<br/><br/>One way to think of PIS is as a set of predicates, or statements, about the Game State. A predicate and be true or false. Each player's PIS contains statements that the player <i>believes</i> are true; there's no sense in a player holding a predicate in her head that she believes is false.<br/><br/>For example...<br/><br/>Adam might believe:<br/>A1. The current date in the world is 1489.<br/>A2. Waterdeep is a city in the world of Faerun, the Forgotten Realms.<br/>A3. Waterdeep is ruled by the Masked Lords and the Open Lord.<br/>A4. The Open Lord of Waterdeep is Dagult Neverember.<br/><br/>Bey might believe:<br/>B1. The current date in the world is 1489.<br/>B2. Waterdeep is a city in the world of Faerun, the Forgotten Realms.<br/>B3. Waterdeep is ruled by the Masked Lords and the Open Lord.<br/>B4. The Open Lord of Waterdeep is Laeral Silverhand.<br/><br/>Chen, the GM, might believe:<br/>C1. The current date in the world is 1488.<br/>C2. Waterdeep is a city in the world of Faerun, the Forgotten Realms.<br/>C3. Waterdeep is ruled by the Masked Lords and the Open Lord.<br/>C4. The Open Lord of Waterdeep is Laeral Silverhand.<br/><br/>The actual Game State (the Truth) is maybe something like:<br/>C1. The current date in the world is Hammer (January) 1, 1488.<br/>C2. Waterdeep is a city in the world of Faerun, the Forgotten Realms.<br/>C3. Waterdeep is ruled by the Masked Lords and the Open Lord.<br/>C4. The Open Lord of Waterdeep is Dagult Neverember.<br/><br/>Obviously, things like dates are pretty easy to get right, but somehow the GM thinks it's 1488. When Chen mentions the date, Adam and Bey are gonna go, "Huh? I thought it was 1489." Chen will probably check their notes and maybe the rules and some other stuff. This is because the date is set in the Game State, and the GM can consult the Game State using Techniques and get an answer, share that with the table, and everyone can come to an agreement about the date. Let's say the GM was wrong and it's really 1489, but it's January (Hammer) 1. Great.<br/><br/>What about the difference in the question of who the Open Lord is? In standard Forgotten Realms history canon, Neverember embezzled a bunch of money from Waterdeep and fled the city in 1489, so depending on the month, either might be Open Lord. Maybe this is after Silverhand has taken the role but Adam doesn't know it yet.<br/><br/>Okay, that's a lot of preamble, but I thought having an example might help.<br/><br/><b>SIS-union:</b><br/><br/>In this case, the union of all these predicates is: A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3, C4. These can be "collapsed" with a trick like this: AB1, C1, ABC2, ABC3, A4, BC4.<br/><br/><b>SIS-intersection:</b><br/><br/>In this case, the intersection of these predicates is only where everyone agrees, the "ABC" predicates: ABC2, ABC3. Obviously, an intersection is a useless tool for MIS, since it has nothing to say about the places where people conflict, so facts get entirely left out.<br/><br/>So I agree, let's totally discard SIS-intersection as a useless idea. <br/><br/><b>But what use is SIS-union?</b><br/><br/>It's actually not a subset of Game State, since C1 (The current date in the world is 1488) is wrong. BC4 is wrong. Those predicates do not belong to the G* set. <br/><br/><i>What purpose does it serve?</i><br/><br/>Hopefully this idea of thinking about PIS and Game State as a set of predicates is a useful addition. The predicates in the Game State are by definition <i>true</i>. The predicates in a player's PIS are <i>believed to be true</i>, but might not be. Even the GM's PIS is necessarily a subset (incomplete version) of the Game State. Even the GM's PIS can contain predicates which are false and are not members of the Game State.                        </div>

                            As far as I understand, SIS is about the fiction, while game state includes the game mechanical state of the game. Does this match your ideas and is this intentional?                        </div>

                            Adam, <b>yes</b>, I realized this when I made my diagram yesterday; that the players might think a floor is safe to thread on but in the blorb (in the game state, in the whatever name you want for it, in the SIS-2 as opposed to SIS-4) it's actually a trap there.

                            So why does the term MIS exist? Because we were at first talking about reality and then some people freaked out and then we switched the term to SIS and then some people freaked out [rightfully so since the Forge SIS is <i>explicitly</i> the SIS-<b>4</b> which I didn't know] and then we switched the term to MIS which was kinda dumb and then <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> (I think?) came up with the name "game state" for it which was awesome and got people on the right page finally. On another forum where I've started tryna teach this stuff I've just been calling it "the blorb". As per my diagram.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I was finding the “clarifications” in the other thread less than useful, so I’m glad the conversation is happening here.<br/><br/>I think “game state” would be the best term, as it’s not going to get confused with all the IS acronyms, nor the idea of blorb as a set of techniques or play agenda.<br/><br/>Now, what does it mean, in your mind, to “consult the game state”, to get an answer to a question?

                            I want to separate the Game State, which is not a thing in people's heads, from the Imagined Space, which <i>is</i> a thing in people's heads.<br/><br/>I think, all along, the Forge didn't have that clarity, so it often conflated them and ended up with the mess of a definition that SIS is.

                            That would be a reference to "eigenstate," which is a term from quantum physics meaning "the juxtaposition of two or more potential states simultaneously, prior to a deciding event."

                            When I talk about Game State, I mean "all the stuff the system operates on", which in an RPG usually includes all the variants on *-imagined-space you can think of + a bunch of stuff that's typically not part of imagined events in anyone's mind, like hit points, and which PC belongs to which player.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> , I've thought about the "every pair of players shares different beliefs" issue a lot. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22157/reference-frames?new=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">This post on Reference Frames</a> has my most coherent thoughts about it.                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>The G* isn't the Imagined Space at all. It's the set of all true predicates in the game, known or unknown by the players. It's the Game State. <br/><br/>You've said you call that the blorb, but I think it exists in all kinds of role-play, blorby or otherwise, so I've been avoiding that term.<br/><br/>PIS is important (as an idea--whatever we end up calling it) because gaming is basically this:<br/><br/>PIS &lt;---&gt; Technique &lt;---&gt; Engine &lt;---&gt; Game State<br/><br/>That's the main path for game play. There's also cross-talk between game participants that doesn't involve Techniques, <i>per se</i>, and it can change PIS, too. <br/><br/>Or a person can think and change their mind about their PIS.<br/><br/>Those are the only three ways that PIS changes, I think.                         </div>

I might be sillily literal here but if we are moving in an imagined <i>space</i> such as a house. (I mean, our characters are moving in there.) We all imagine this house. In blorb model, we "imagine" [albeit not in <i>all</i> senses of the word "imagine"] the sack of money in the closet on the second floor <i>even without even being aware of it, or of the closet it's in</i> because we have <i>committed to pretending that the house <b>and all of its contents</b> are true</i>.                        </div>

G*: If I commit to pretending that the house and all of its contents are true, that's one thing.<br/><br/>Current imagination: If I imagine the house (a physical (the brain is physical) action I can take by e.g. closing my eyes and watching what I see in my mind's eye (this is how I guess it works, personally I don't have visual mental imagery (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia</a>))) certain things will show themselves to me and others won't. Some will be salient bits of the house and its contents and some are below the threshold of "what does my brain think is important enough to be part of this imagining act". That's a different thing.<br/><br/>Imagined space: If I take as much time as I please to imagine the house and all of its contents, leisurely going over every part of the house and asking my brain to show <i>everything</i>, not just the bits it thinks are salient, I will see more than a casual imagining. But crucially I will not see the sack of money in the closet on the second floor because though I am committed to a procedure which <i>will</i> agree that the money exists, all I have right now is a procedure and maybe a pointer, with no physical ability to imagine the money concretely. This is a third thing.<br/><br/>Suppose the PCs make a quick pass through the house, ascertaining its general layout and peeking in every room, getting a brief description of the room which has a closet, without finding the sack of money.<br/><br/>To me, then:<br/><br/>G* = game state = sack of money exists<br/><br/>Current imagination: players' imagination as their PCs are in the kitchen planning what to do next = probably closet doesn't exist unless they've paid very close attention, sack of money doesn't exist, agreement to accept that sack of money exists immediately upon hearing about it does exist, agreement to accept that closet exists as soon as someone actually remembers <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> or they're reminded by the GM does exist<br/><br/>Imagined space: players' imagined space = closet exists, sack of money doesn't exist, agreement to accept that sack of money exists immediately upon hearing about it does exist<br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> , I'd say there's the communicated imagined space, whether union or overlap, and the various personal imagined spaces, and all of these things <i>may</i> feed into the game state depending on the system.<br/><br/>Few games treat all their fictional facts equally.  In a given game, we might have the following facts from the following sources:<br/><b>General time &amp; place:</b> Published canon<br/><b>Specific time &amp; place:</b> Group's pre-play agreement<br/><b>Open Lord:</b> The GM's PIS<br/><b>How far apart the combatants are when we first place the figures on the hex map:</b> Only a full table consensus will suffice.<br/><b>How close the PC gets to the NPC before insulting them:</b> The acting player's PIS<br/><br/>That would be one system, and then in another system every one of those things would have to be rolled on a table, and in yet another system it's just whichever participant speaks up first, etc.  So I'd say the relationships between PIS and game state are as varied as game systems are.                        </div>

                            Guy, I kinda don't want to overrule you too much on this stuff because I trust you and your acuity around this stuff. But.<br/><br/>When I enter an extra-diegetical house here on Earth, I do so even though I don't know the contents of every room. Isn't it similar when we enter an imaginary house? And we both share-2 that fantasy? Uh. Maybe you got that I was tryna say that and you answered something else.                        </div>

I think what I was trying to call out is...<br/><br/>The imaginary house has the closet with the money in it.<br/><br/>But when I imagine the house it does not have the money in it. While we could say "my imagination is simply flawed either due to lack of knowledge or due to forgetfulness", I think what's in my imagination is worth calling out as different.<br/><br/>Hm. Maybe it's a verb thing.<br/><br/>When I hear the phrase "imagined space" I think of a space which is imagined, and the imaginary house is not in fact actually imagined. So that's why I think "imagined space" != game state, because what's imagined is not the game state.                        </div>

                            Ah cool. I'm definitely on board with that. So here's a question to all y'all visualizers: what is it like to visualize a house with unknown things in it? Gray blob, morphing imagery, concrete stuff but every time you mentally look away and back the stuff changes...?                        </div>

                            For me (non-visualizer) what I imagine is in my ... friend's tiny half-height closet that we joke is a hobbit dwelling (I pretty much know what's in all of my rooms/drawers/etc):<br/><br/>Some boxes with nothing in them and maybe they're collapsed, and maybe that's where they store their Christmas decorations, and for some reason a sweater that I'm certain doesn't exist, and it's definitely dusty (it probably isn't because how would dust get in there).                        </div>

                            Those are hypotheticals, right? <br/><br/>That's sorta useful for gaming. For gaming, you really need to know "What is in the closet right now?" or "Are there Christmas decorations in the closet?"<br/><br/>Depending on prep and other techniques, there's some way for you to make this determination.<br/><br/>Think of the Game State as a set of true predicates like:<br/>* There are Christmas decorations in the closet.<br/>* The closet contains a dusty old sweater.<br/>* The closet doesn't actually contain a Hobbit.<br/><br/><i>Regardless of what you imagine</i>, these are the predicates of the Game State.<br/><br/>Now you can start imagining all you want about what the Game State is. But it doesn't change the Game State till you apply certain techniques to do so. <br/><br/>Sandra probably uses techniques like "Prep what's in the closet, then refer to prep when asked about its contents." Or "Consult 'd1000 things found in a closet' table." <br/><br/>The Game State definitely has an opinion about the contents of the closet, though. It might be <i>undetermined</i> at the time the question is asked, but it has a <i>truth</i>.                         </div>

                            Not hypothetical. We (I) have moved to asking about what your actual brain actually does when you ask it to imagine a container with unknown things in it. Maybe you get a mental image of the container with a big black REDACTED bar? Who knows. What's it look like to you?                        </div>

"Imagine what it's like to be in a house where you don't know the layout or what's in the rooms" is super easy and poses no special problems at all.                        </div>

                            I think we're talking about the relationship between the gamestate and our individual imaginations?<br/><br/>There's a thread of "how can I agree to the money in the chest when I don't yet know about it so I can't imagine it?"<br/><br/>And I think the question's misplaced. It supposes that I'm to imagine the gamestate, which is true in some games, but in other games, in fact no, I'm to imagine my character's experience, incorporating details as they're delivered to me, and leave the gamestate to other game processes to create.<br/><br/>Oh wait am I in the wrong thread?                        </div>

It’s the whole <strong>Paper→Rock</strong> thing again.<br/><br/>Here’s another analogy:<br/><br/>Take an imaginary deck of cards [the cards don’t need to exist physically] and select one card and place it face down (imaginarily) without showing me which card it is. That card is one particular card. <em>That card</em> is our “playing piece”. (If there is a trust issue, <small>which, because the 90s happened, there is,</small> write down what card it is so we can double check later.)<br/><br/>Place the card face down in the dungeon / “house” / “chest” or whatever. And as we’re playing in the dungeon I get a super vivid mental picture of a face down card. <small>(Not to be ablist vs aphantasia. I came up with <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/introducing-late-night-fighting/" rel="nofollow">predicate space</a> with you guys in mind.)</small> That face down card — and I don’t know if that’s a “three of clubs” or a “XIII Death” or a “Ring of Ma’rûf” or whatever it is—but that face down card is part of the game now. And I know it’s <em>one particular card</em> because: you committed. You promised. I believe in <em>that</em> particular card.<br/><br/>I mean this particular interaction or style of gameplay is what I’m trying get at. It’s magical. The <em>word</em> for this interaction? Semantics! It’s “blorb” for all I care!<br/><br/> </div>

I'm like "let's pretend the two of us is sitting in a boat". How many boats are there? IDC, that's how many! As long as we're in the same boat in <i>some</i> sense of the word. Obv the color "red" if two of us look at the same apple might look completely different because of our different arrays of cone photoreceptors in our retinas. How many apples are there!??!                        </div>

What does "believing in this particular house" have to do with Paper-Rock? They seem fairly unrelated to me. (I can totally choose to believe in a house the GM is making up on the spot, after all.)<br/><br/>Sometimes it seems to me that this whole discussion might be just a fancy way of saying, "I like roleplaying where every participant treats the imaginary world we're exploring as a real place, with its own facts and truths, and we commit to a style of play where we don't change those on a whim." <br/><br/>If that's my takeaway from this whole discussion, what am I missing?<br/><br/>(I suppose there's also the "write things down in advance, to avoid Paper-Rock issues", as a Technique, but that seems less foundational to me - a useful trick, but not fundamental to the whole enterprise.)<br/><br/><br/>Vincent,<br/><br/>I agree with you that that is an important, key distinction! I feel like this conversation occasionally loses sight of such distinctions, so I'm glad you brought it up.<br/><br/> </div>

It's a reference to the Śūraṅgama sūtra. Some peeps when you're tryna show them the moon and you take them out into the starry night meadow and you stand there among all the fireflies and barley and poppies and you point straight up to that big old beautiful moon…<br/><br/>…and they're like: "gee, your nail polish is really starting to flake!"

Yes. But. Getting to that was like pulling teeth for crying out loud!<br/><img alt="image" src="https://idiomdrottning.org/mower.png"/><br/><b>And</b> phrasing it like that allows peeps to skimp on the deets! I need to be crystal &amp; precise around this so that this kind of roleplaying doesn't die with me.                        </div>

That hasn't been my experience. Once I <i>knew</i> that the objects and enemies and locations I was interactions with were real and blorby everything changed. It's not just about the GM being pro or against the player (or their characters). It's about everything being really <i>there</i>.                        </div>

                            Yeah, we totally have different experiences.  I enjoy comparing notes!  As for things being real, though, I'm 100% with you on how valuable that is.  I think we just differ on what's necessary for us to feel like something is real.<br/><br/>I'm glad you're developing and documenting what works for you, because I don't just want the games I run to feel real only to people who think like me.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

It's a reference to the Śūraṅgama sūtra.

                            Jay and I are having some really cool personal conversations about all this. <br/><br/>My entire post here wasn't to mire us in jargon. It was to try to sell the point that:<br/><br/>1. Old Forge language around SIS, Exploration, etc. was incomplete at the time, and is failing us now.<br/><br/>2. There's this gaming thing out there that isn't in anyone's heads, full of everything true about the game. I want to call that the Game State.<br/><br/>3. There's a tiny version / subset of that with errors in each person's head. I want to call that the PIS.<br/><br/>4. I have no idea what it means to share PIS, and I have no idea why it's useful for theory or game design discussion at all.                        </div>

                            Hi Paul,<br/><br/>I can't speak for Adam, but I'm just as lost as ever.  I have no idea what constitutes Game State that is different from the SIS, how it functions, who decides it has credibility, exactly what information that it contains beyond the exposed SIS, who can alter the Game State directly, what methods/techniques are used to do so, is it really an objective super state that is self organizing and holds truth when everyone else including the DM is in error, etc.  Though we've had lengthy exchanges in the end we're still hashing out basic vocabulary issues.<br/><br/>Adam has been very articulate and has been presenting many interesting ideas, though.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Since we all have our own glimpses of the game state, the game state is this "imagined space" that we "share". Is all I'm saying. I am &amp; was always talking about the <b>2</b>.                        </div>

                            OK now that I have come down from that bad acid trip (which was cruel to everyone who was reading and got worried and I feel bad about that and I wish I hadn't behaved that way but I <small>oh shit I can see myself going down the same path again let me stop myself right here: ok. It's OK. They love you Sandra. Or some hate you and that's cool too.</small>) let me give my take on the topic at hand.<br/><br/>I groove on the idea that PIS, Gamestate, MIS, SIS etc are <b>sets</b>. Nice, Adam! ♥<br/><br/><b>Game state:</b> super interesting, we want it, love it, want to design to it. This is what I was calling the MIS or the SIS-2. Not <i>literally</i> a union of the various PIS around the table—has things that is only in the book for example. (Blackrazor in the "S2 over the mountain" example.) It's just closest to a union of PIS than it is to an intersection. Not that that's saying much.<br/>The <b>SIS-4:</b> the subset of the game state that has been <i>communicated</i> about. May include wrong things! "Floor is safe" when it's actually trapped! This is closer to an intersection of the various PIS than it is to a union. Still not <i>literally</i>  an intersection because things can be contradicted between the various PIS, and or things can be uncommunicated about but still coincidentally coexisting in various PIS. (Such as two players coincidentally imagining that a flag is red when the flag's color hasn't been stated.)<br/>A <b>PIS:</b> the subset of the game state that <i>one person</i> know about. In the treasure chest drawing example it includes the lock, the iron bands, the wooden surface, but not the contents.                        </div>

                            I should say that I only borrowed the term Game State from you, who talked about the offscreen canonical gamestate. I thought that formulation was magical, and kept using it. Game State is just easier to type.                         </div>

                            Er, hrm.<br/><br/>It might be useful to say the game state contains predicates like:<br/><br/>1. Elminster's eyes are gray. (true)<br/>2. Adam believes Elminster's eyes are blue. (true)<br/><br/>But it doesn't contain:<br/><br/>3. Elminster's eyes are blue. (false)<br/><br/>Adam's PIS does, though. Statement 3 has to belong somewhere, but I don't think it belongs in the game state. Otherwise, it contains a near-infinite number of false facts for each true fact.                        </div>

                            One reason I have avoided using "blorg" terminology is because I don't want to step on it with my ideas. <br/><br/>If your "offscreen canonical gamestate" / "the blorg" idea was only used for Blorg play, my Game State is used for <i>all modes of play</i>. It exists for Sorcerer games, D&amp;D 4e games, for Cary's Middle Earth games, and for your Blorg games.

                            I haven't been engaging with this topic a whole deal lately, and it's mostly because throughout all these conversations I'm not seeing any consensus or even any clear definition of what "game state" means. <br/><br/>If the "game state" includes things like false statements...
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>3. Elminster's eyes are blue. (false)<br/></p></div></blockquote>
...that's a pretty questionable thing, and possible even impossible to define. It would have to include all kinds of ridiculous things. So I'm with Adam on this one.<br/><br/>I see a similar problem with this:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>2. Adam believes Elminster's eyes are blue. (true)<br/></p></div></blockquote>
Assuming that "Adam" here is a player (I'm assuming that's why Adam used his own name), this suggests a really bizarre idea, which is that a *player's* ideas about the game are part of this "game state". I could accept the idea that a *character's* available information, beliefs, and delusions are part of the "game state", since those are important predicates (e.g. if you think something is safe to eat, but it's actually poisoned), but including player beliefs sounds like a really slippery slope. Can my expectations about the game, before we even start playing, be considered part of the game state? That sounds really messy.<br/><br/>So, what is the game state? What does it include? <br/><br/>(Oddly enough, perhaps, "offscreen canon gamestate" makes some sense to me, but not so much the term 'game state' by itself - or, at least, I couldn't explain it to someone else, and for me "being able to explain it to someone else" is a big part of what I consider necessary for real understanding.)<br/><br/>I'm going to throw out some categories of things I've heard discussed so far, and you (plural) tell me what you think belongs and what doesn't. These are based on the discussions I've heard and followed so far - things that have been mentioned in these threads. You (plural) should also say what I'm omitting, if anything!<br/><br/>1. Facts about the fictional reality we're playing in.<br/><br/>I have trouble with this one, because there is no reference to the real world. What does this even mean? What are we talking about? Compare with the more specific formulations that follow:<br/><br/>2. Facts that have been spoken aloud or otherwise communicated to the other players, and accepted as part of the fictional reality.<br/><br/><i>Last week, we played and Morgrim entered the General's room. The GM described a red vase in the corner. So there is a red vase in the General's room.</i><br/><br/>This is traditional SIS stuff; makes sense.<br/><br/>3. Facts that are held by a player with authority over that fictional material, but have not yet been communicated.<br/><br/>These are basically "secrets" or "plans", held by players which have been granted social authority by the group over that area of the fictional reality.<br/><br/><i>* The GM has decided that the vase in the General's room holds a demon's soul, but hasn't told anyone just yet.<br/></i><br/><i>* The player has decided that Morgrim's father was killed by a demon, many years ago, but hasn't told anyone just yet.<br/></i><br/><br/>And what about this one? Let's call it 3(b), since it's definitely part of this category, but an unusual case:<br/><br/><i>* Julie played with us last year, and she said something about the demon living in Mortown, the village where Morgrim grew up. She mentioned that she knows the demon's name, but never told anyone.</i><br/><br/><i>Morgrim's player says: "Hey, that's surely the demon that killed my dad! Maybe we should call Julie - I know she lives in Australia now, but I got her Skype contact - and ask her what the demon's name is, yeah?"</i><br/><br/>Is the demon's name, in this case, part of the "game state"? <br/><br/>Does it matter whether Julie actually picked a name for the demon, or just makes one up when the call is made? How does that affect the "game state"?<br/><br/>4. Facts that are written down, as a way to remember them, by a player granted social authority by the group over that area of the fictional reality.<br/><br/>As above:<br/><br/><i>* The GM's notes say that the vase in the General's room holds a demon's soul.<br/></i><br/><i>* The player's written backstory says that Morgrim's father was killed by a demon, many years ago.<br/></i><br/><br/><i>* Julie has a notebook in her storage locker, where she wrote down the demon's name.</i><br/><br/>5. A written record or notes (or drawing, or audio recording, or whatever) which the group has agreed to honour.<br/><br/>* <i>We are playing Module 24C, by Stephen King; its contents are therefore 'canon'.</i><br/><br/>* <i>"Oh! It turns out Julie left her notes here when she moved to Australia. I see them under the desk!"</i><br/><br/>* <i>We are playing in Middle Earth, and all of Tolkien's works are therefore 'canon'.</i><br/><br/>(On a sidenote, what happens if we disagree with some of the content? What if we've agreed that we don't want any spiders in our game, because one of the players suffers from severe arachnophobia, and it turns out that the module has spiders on page 56?)<br/><br/>6. Rules and procedures which we can use to generate fictional material for us in play.<br/><br/>* <i>A list of random encounter tables describing the types of people you might meet in the city of Mortown, and a random table of professions.</i><br/><br/>If we roll up an NPC who is "a jolly, fat man" and "a constable", at what point does this particular person become part of the game state? Are all those professions and all those types of people part of the game state? <br/><br/>* <i>A random table listing names of demons.</i><br/><br/>If Julie turns out to be unreachable, and we agree to use this table, are the names on the list part of the "game state"? Or just the one we roll up? If there are 100 names on the list, does that mean that "there are 100 demons in this world" is a fact of the "game state"?<br/><br/>* <i>An Apocalypse World-style "pick from this list" menagerie of weird historical events for the GM to use.</i><br/><br/>Are all these historical events now part of the "game state" in any way? Or does the type of event listed there somehow affect the "game state" (e.g. they are all tragic events)?<br/><br/>7.

Yeah, mainly that is what I've been talking about. "Elminster was born around 212 DR," even if no one at the table knows it. <br/><br/>Why do you need a reference to the real world (by which I take you to mean, "players have accepted it as a fact") for something to be true? <br/><br/>An example I gave Jay:<br/><br/>A player asks what color Elminster's eyes are. They absolutely have a color, right, even before you determine them? The GM can pick a color or look it up in a book or roll it on a table and share that with the group. Let's say the GM says, "frosty blue." What color were Elminster's eyes before the players knew the answer? They were always <i>frosty blue</i>.<br/><br/>The "this was always true" bit of this is what gives Sandra her blorby-happiness.<br/>

The truth is that the demon has a name, only Julie knows it, and she's not there to tell it to you. Or use a Technique to grant Authority to someone else. Then Julie is wrong.

The demon's name is a fact in the Game State, regardless of how or when it is determined. The Game State contains facts that no one knows yet.<br/><br/>When you call Julie and she recalls or makes it up, or the GM says "we're not calling Julie; the demon's name is Alabaster," regardless: the quantum wave collapses, and <i>the truth was always there</i>.<br/><br/></div></blockquote> </div>

There are many Techniques that determine what the Game State is:<br/><br/>* Consult "canon," recorded in people's minds and books and movies<br/>* Make it up on the spot according to whatever seems cool<br/>* Make it up on the spot using well-defined, well-documented principles<br/>* Combine randomization with one of the above<br/>* Reference preparation, where you used another method to determine it in advance<br/><br/>Note that "ask someone" is always applying rules/techniques about Authority to determine who to defer to, but that person still uses one of the above techniques.

Disagreeing with the content comes up all the time, and people figure it out. "When I told you the orc inflicted 9 damage to you, I read the die wrong; it was 6." "Oh, I wrote I have green eyes, not blue." "Wait, I'm on the ledge? I thought I was hanging back?

Two ways to look at this:<br/><br/>1. No, just data goes in the Game State, not code. Rules and procedures may generate or change Game State, but it isn't Game State per se.<br/><br/>2. Hey, code is data, too. The RAW are just data and can be modified using techniques to alter the Game State, including altering the RAW (house-ruling), etc.<br/><br/>I tend to lean toward <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. I think Sandra does, too. It's harder to think about rules as data in this way, though, so I tend to use examples that use Setting and Color instead of System.<br/><br/>But consider: "Random Encounter Table (2d6): When you use a result, cross it off. If you roll that number again later, use the next higher uncrossed entry." That random table <i>and its rules</i> are data as well as code.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>* <i>A list of random encounter tables describing the types of people you might meet in the city of Mortown, and a random table of professions.</i><br/></p></div></blockquote>
Yeah, I include that in the Game State. Its predicate doesn't look like a fact about the game <i>setting</i>, though, but more like a fact about the game <i>system</i>. My model includes the data of all five components of Exploration as part of the Game State.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>* <i>A random table listing names of demons.</i><br/><br/>If Julie turns out to be unreachable, and we agree to use this table, are the names on the list part of the "game state"? Or just the one we roll up? If there are 100 names on the list, does that mean that "there are 100 demons in this world" is a fact of the "game state"?<br/></p></div></blockquote>
The list of names is a tool for one or more Techniques. If you have a Technique that says "lists of names of things mean those things exist somewhere in the setting," then applying that Technique necessarily inserts a bunch of new demon name predicates into the Game State. <br/><br/>Does that make sense? It's important to separate the data used a Techniques from the code (rules) used by a Technique.<br/>

The Game State contains all of the truth of System, Setting, Character, Situation, and Color as data that can be altered by Techniques.<br/><br/>That there are 12 Orcs in the cavern is a fact in the Game State. It's also a fact that there is a <i>rule</i> that says "there are 3d6 Orcs in the cavern." It is not a fact that there are 3d6 Orcs in the cavern, because that is a kind of logical nonsense when not used as a rule ("3d6 in number" doesn't belong in a typical D&amp;D Setting the same way "Orcs" or "Cavern" or "12" do).<br/><br/>But "Adam rolled a 15 'to hit' on behalf of Morgrim last week" could be a fact in the Game State. The Game State knows things about System as well as Setting, so there's rule text in there, but don't conflate it with facts about the Setting. You can apply a Technique against the fact, "Rule: There are 3d6 Orcs in the cavern," to randomly determine that there are 12 orcs in that cavern instance. Then "There are 12 orcs in the cavern" is a fact in the Game State.<br/>

"Deduce [facts] from the mechanics, procedures, or numbers in the design of the game" is a Technique that looks at the System data (as well as other data in the Game State) and generates new facts.<br/><br/>Morgrim has 12 hit points.

That doesn't seem like a fact in the Game State. The facts are things like:<br/>* There's a red vase in the General's room.<br/>* The vase contains a demon.<br/>* Knocking over the vase will break it.<br/>* Breaking a vase with a demon in it will free the demon.<br/>* Rule: Freeing a demon inflicts 3d10 damage on everyone within 30 feet.<br/>

I think our diagrams are basically the same thing, but mine is in Big Model language and yours uses more natural language. I feel that people interpret natural language with too much baggage (how people interpreted "Simulationism," for example, or probably why you used made-up terms like "Blorby").<br/> </div>

That's amazing. I would never do that, but I stare at you in wonder because you embarked on that journey--even if you never finished it.<br/><br/>I wonder if prolog or some kind of ontological rules engine would be a better platform.

                            Talking about sets, if you want to link MIS and Game State, you need layers. As I see it, you construct MIS from the foundational "Game State" layer (with some local feedback interactions : character action). The two sets never match (characters have no access to the essence of things) except by "true sight" magic.                        </div>

                            "Layers" implies that things touch directly, no, or that they're directly comparable in some way. I'd avoid that interpretation.<br/><br/>The Game State is this imaginary, conceptual thing. It's useful to imagine it really exists, but it's more of a <i>potential</i> or <i>field of possibility</i>. If you see me using quantum physics analogies, that's why.<br/><br/>PIS is an actual thing in someone's head. There are Techniques people get out of the Game State and into their heads and then they use them to explore the Game State, ultimately changing it.<br/><br/>So there's a relationship between PIS and Game State, but they're not layered. Also, I don't consider PIS a subset of Game State. There's some overlap, but PIS contains false predicates that are not in the Game State.<br/><br/>You're right when you say "you construct MIS from the foundational "Game State" layer (with some local feedback interactions : character action)." But not by looking at Game State directly. You always interact with it through Techniques, which are interpreters and marshals of the Game State.<br/><br/>Because it's conceptual, the Game State isn't this thing you can just go look at. It's not the RAW or the Setting Book or the knowledge in the GM's head (though all of those things contribute to the Game State <i>as tools</i>). That's why Techniques are required to interpret it.                        </div>

Yeah, but there's a different level of realness to something that is imagined in someone's head right now, and something that isn't imagined fully in anyone's head at all, ever, but has the potential to reveal parts of itself when probed using certain techniques.<br/><br/> </div>

If this “game state” business we are talking about is simply something that we are *pretending* is real (and agreeing to treat as real, even though it’s not) then that solves 99% (maybe even 100%!) of my issues with this discussion.<br/><br/> </div>

                             Oh, I think you misunderstood my question.

Isn’t everything unrealized potential, for instance?                         </div>

                            It's not unrealized after you realize it. This seems really obvious to me, so maybe I still don't understand your question.<br/><br/>How many hit points does Bubba have? Is the fact realized or not? <br/><br/>Are you asking if there's a class of things that cannot be potential facts?<br/><br/>I think you need to define what you mean by "everything" in "isn't everything unrealized potential?" By everything, do you mean the entire contents of the Game State or do you mean any possible thing anyone could come up with, even if it could never be in the Game State?<br/><br/>Like, the D&amp;D 5e Game State for Mirrorrim didn't have any facts about Star Wars TIE Fighters, so there's no potential or realized facts about them. It does have dragons, though, even if you never encountered any, so there are potential and/or realized facts about dragons in that Game State.                        </div>

                            Paul, Adam: I just didn't want Adam to miss all the discussion about this that we already had have because I was afraid he'd paint himself into a corner where the game state can't contain errors. Which it can. Just like the SIS-4 can. (Or, I think this was Jeph's example, like a chess piece accidentally out of place on the board in a game of chess.) And, just like errors in the SIS-4, errors in the game state can be corrected or they can be missed when no-one knows about them.<br/><br/>These corrections can go in one of two directions: A. we're going with the newly discovered original true fact, or B. we're going with the most used, most established mis-"fact" and making it fact. We decide which depending on a bunch of heuristics but A is much more common. Maybe ten times more common.<br/><br/>I've understood that "no myth" games are likelier to go with B as their correction method more often than not. "Oh you found the old note what the demon was called? Enh never mind we're OK with the new name." That's what they might say. But they might go with the A correction method too sometimes. It just depends on a bunch of outside factors.<br/><br/>Errors and error corrections aren't part of the intended operation of the blorb.<br/><br/>This is what's frustrating about this argument and how it's been addressed over and over again. The SIS-4 (that is to say, the "transcript" of statements made at the table) can have exactly the same issue, in a "no myth" game. Yet no-one is saying that it doesn't exist, that no statements are made at the table.<br/><br/>People make mistakes. I make a thousand mistakes every day, that's kind of my jam.                        </div>

Maybe I'm painting myself into a corner, but I'm pretty comfortable with my brush right now. LOL.<br/><br/>I do not believe the Game State contains errors or false facts.<br/><br/>When a chess piece is accidentally out of place, the Game State is not in error; the chess piece is. The chess board is a representation of the Game State--a recording tool--and it can be in error. Everyone sitting in the room might not realize that a piece on the chess board is out of place and be thinking, "Mate in 3, dude!" and then at some point, someone reviews their paper notation and realizes the mistake. <br/><br/>Mistakes are made in transcription to paper, transcription to PIS, transcription to boards. The Game State is true.<br/><br/>

Corrections are not made to the Game State. They're made to various erroneous and incomplete recordings of parts of the Game State: on paper, in our heads (PIS), and on boards and such.<br/>

                            This is the first time we are in disagreement about what the game state is.<br/>In Magic the game state, and the failure to maintain it, and how to correct errors to it, is codified. <a href="https://ddg.gg/failure_to_maintain_game_state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ddg.gg/failure_to_maintain_game_state</a><br/><br/>Since we are playing a roleplaying game with all its gödelian imperfections I take a post-modern approach to its central datastructure (the blorb) as being able to contain and resolve contradictions. Just like my own understanding of reality. This isn't meant to be abused to put in Schrödinger orcs in there. It's meant for error discovery and correction.<br/><br/>The paragraph…<br/>In the discussion earlier Paul was saying that the game state <i>couldn't exist</i> because there could be errors. But, the "transcript" (in Forge terms) can have errors—and error correction—too. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. My view on errors and error correction is 100% isomorphic and analogous between the two models ("no myth" vs "blorb model"). You can say "this box is red" and then go "oh shit i meant blue, i misspoke". The fact that we are more likely to error correct in the direction of sticking with the prep rather than sticking with the "mistake" we've been assuming at the table for the last hour is an argument in favor of the existence of the game state which, at the time, was being questioned by several posters.                        </div>

                            One can look at the game state in two ways.<br/><br/>a. The game state at a particular moment. This tells what actions players can take and what consequences these actions have, or how the game state will evolve. (With possible randomness.)<br/><br/>b. The trajectory (through time) or history of the particular game. This includes the game state at all particular previous moments, including the mechanical and the fictional situation at those moments. This is a timeless perspective in the sense that the observer is not situated in time, but looks at the progression of the game from outside.<br/><br/>If we consider a game of chess where a particular piece was misplaced and game continued after that and was ended, what does it look like? From perspective b we have a unique game state. One of the transitions in that game state simply did not follow the rules of the game.<br/><br/>Maybe Adam and Sandra could discuss this example to shed light on the issue?                        </div>

                            Corrections to errors in transcribing the game state to PIS or whatever are corrected by changing the PIS, not by changing the game state. This is because the game state is always correct and true.<br/><br/>The trueness of the game state is what makes the <i>offscreen</i> and <i>canonical</i> parts of "offscreen canonical game state" work. <br/><br/>Regarding the <a href="https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg2-6/" rel="nofollow">MtG rules</a>:
<blockquote>The key point here is that both players are responsible for the game state. If the opponent is being observant, they can help catch a player’s error before the problem becomes more severe. It doesn’t matter who gained an advantage from it. Note that there are some situations where one player controls the effect, and the other player takes the action, but did so in a way that caused an error. In this case, please refer to the Game Rule Violation section, as there are some cases where both players have committed the same infraction.</blockquote>
This is saying that the MtG game state exists independently of what the players believe, that it can hold a truth that no one at the table might know. <br/><br/>Changes to the game state in Magic are so much more codified that it's easier to see than a violation to game state in an RPG. The Exploration space is so much smaller in Magic.<br/><br/>The Blorb doesn't need to contain contradictions. The contradictions exist at the transcript level, where errors are made. <br/><br/>I suppose it's a very postmodern idea that truth doesn't exist anywhere. I could, as a choice, say that my Game State contains errors. Yet, <i>I don't find that useful at all</i>. I already have a place for errors in my model, and that's in the transcription process.<br/><br/>Consider: without a single source of truth, you don't have errors; you only have differences. When you consult the gloracle, you can't be sure that it's right, because it contains errors. Why is that a useful idea?<br/><br/>"This box is red... oh shit, I meant blue... I misspoke..." Did the data in the blorb just change rapidly? Why is that useful? My Game State holds that the box is blue (in game reality, not real-person reality) and always was, even if we thought otherwise for a second. <br/><br/>Be clear that I'm making an argument for utility -- "why is it useful to have errors in the blorb?" -- and not because it has to be that way. <br/><br/>The Game State is a collection of all the data it needs to play a game. It doesn't need errors! Errors arise in transcription, but that's a people problem. The game only needs salient data, right? Errors are not salient (until they are, of course). Each Technique introduced to play necessarily exposes new salient data structures. What kind of Technique requires the game state to hold onto errors?                        </div>

This is why I'm reading Deleuze. :-)<br/><br/>He actually has terms for this kind of stuff.<br/><br/>The game state as you describe it might be considered the realm of <i>The Virtual</i>.  The Virtual is distinguished from the <i>Possible,</i> in that the former always exists even if it is not currently <i>Actualized</i> (manifest), while the latter only becomes <i>Real</i> contingently, or else never existed at all (like the items you <i>didn't</i> roll on a table).<br/><br/> </div>

Side note: A surrealist game might certainly do this, make errors canonical, or in Deleuzian terms, permit "accidental" wholesale modification of the Virtual from within the world of the Actual.  Why not?  In such a milieu, there is no necessary dividing line between subjective and objective data, and probably less of a dividing line between player and character as well.<br/><br/>Not that I consider it anything more than an edge case, but you <i>did</i> ask. :-)<br/><br/> </div>

The chess board is a representation of the Game State–a recording tool–and it can be in error.</p></div></blockquote>The chess board in chess is an <strong>analogy</strong> for the game state in blorby RPGs.<br/><br/>I do also separate the map (gloracle) from the territory (blorb) but errors in game state become part of the game state when other actions are taken in the game state that depend on that error.<br/><br/>For example your cat comes over and bumps a pawn wrongly and neither player notices. Later, when a piece is captured by that pawn, and yet later another piece is saved by it’s original captor being already captured by the stray pawn and so on, the error has been thoroughly enmeshed in the game state.<br/><br/>If the blorb can contain errors, and the gloracle has procedures in place for correcting those errors as they are discovered, the game is more robust.<br/><br/>But that’s not what you’re asking. You’re asking why should the errors be in the blorb and not in the gloracle?<br/><br/>There are gloracle-level errors and blorb-level errors.<br/><br/>A chess game exists on the board, in the players’ minds, and in the paper transcript kept by both players.<br/>Those four “cave wall” level items are “the gloracle” of chess (along with the rules, opening book, endgame tablebase etc).<br/><br/>But the game state in a game of chess (whether it’s represented by a board or by a FEN string) both defines and is defined by the entities in it. And those entities are manipulated by the players in accordance with the rules. (Just as how the blorb is manipulated by the participants according to the rules — the players by having their characters take actions, the GM more limitedly.) And that entity manipulation, if continued (even a single ply) from an erroneous position, can cause the game state &amp; blorb to have errors.<br/><br/>So in the cat pawn example, there is definitely an inconsistency in the gloracle if a pawn is off. But once that off pawn has had consequences in the game state itself (i.e. the blorb itself), the game state itself also has errors.<br/><br/> </div>

                            It's really heartening how many people on SG have a workable knowledge of impenetrable 20th century philosophy (and are sometimes-willing to apply it to the topic of roleplaying games), especially given this place's relatively small size.

At the point the chess players realize that a cat bumped the pawn, they have to make a decision (apply a technique) to determine how to proceed. They can rewind the game and play from the correction or they can enshrine the error as truth. That is, in the second  case, it ceases to be "false." In neither case are you recording falsities in the game state. The game state is always assumed to be correct. Copies of the game state can contain errors, but not the game state, otherwise there's no referent to determine if anything is ever correct!<br/>

No, I'm asking, why should the errors be in the blorb, and not in the transcript.<br/><br/>The gloracle is not the transcript, right? It's the Engine in my model, the place that the data components of Exploration, especially System, are loaded and turned from data into code (Techniques). It's the thing that can be used during a game to probe the blorb for new truths.<br/><br/>In transmitting information back to error-prone people, that's where errors are made.<br/>

I disagree with the first statement, sorta. The chess game exists only in the game state. A <i>copy</i> of the chess game exists in on the board, in the players' minds, and on the paper transcript. That copy can contain errors. That copy is a tool used as inputs to game techniques that players use to play the game and to detect and correct errors made during play.<br/><br/>Think about an illegal move. I pick up my knight and put it somewhere it could not legally reach. Let's say you looked away for a second and I moved the piece. The board reflects only the game state after the move, but you know I moved the knight illegally, because you remember the prior game state. What is the true game state now? <br/><br/>In what layer was the error made and recorded?<br/>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>So in the cat pawn example, there is definitely an inconsistency in the gloracle if a pawn is off. But once that off pawn has had consequences in the game state itself (i.e. the blorb itself), the game state itself also has errors.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
Why not say that the blorb contains no inconsistency as a result of the cat moving the pawn? That the blorb knows that that cat moved it, knows what the game should be, and when the players find the error and correct it, the blorb nods and says, "I was waiting for you to see that."<br/><br/>At the point of detection, you already have a class of data called Error in your PIS. You know that there are two possible versions of the truth (one right, one wrong). If you make the correction and the blorb is also wrong, what are you correcting it to? How do you know it's wrong? <br/><br/>More likely, you use the gloracle to compare the PIS to the blorb, see that the blorb has a different version of the universe, and correct your PIS to match. That technique might bring in all kinds of other checksums to make sure that changing your PIS is the right thing to do. <br/><br/>Or you use a technique that shows that your error was right all along, even though it didn't follow the standard rules of chess piece movement. "We played 10 moves after that pawn error; the club chess guidelines say keep going. Also, we both transcribed it wrong in our notes, so it's supposed to count." In that case, it turns out that the error was <i>meant to be</i>, and the game state keeps the pawn "misplaced" and it's no longer considered an error to be corrected.<br/><br/> </div>

According to your definitions, those moves aren’t being made. Only “attempted”. According to my definitions, operatiors can still operate on a corrupted datastructure, i.e. those moves <em>are</em> being made. The error correction might involve undoing those moves depending on the specific circumstances of the error.

The specific workings of the gloracle dissembled could separate procedures from data but since procedures are also stored as data because of the nomic quality of the principles, they need to be part of the gloracle proper.

I.e. errors can propagate from people into the gloracle and into the blorb. Also there can be errors in the game design (bad or buggy rules) or in the prep (“it says that this door leads to room 31 on page 43 but to room 21 on page 62… huh…”)

The debated question is whether some of those errors are <em>also</em> propagated into the gamestate proper. In this case, three of our five representations (your transcript, your mind, the wooden board, but not my transcript and not my mind) have the error.<br/><br/>The answer to the question “does the error also exist in the game state proper” is…. hold, on, let’s put that on hold. Because we are going to look at a much easier question:<br/><br/>Let’s say I have a mind glitch and go “ok so you moved the knight there, hmm, didn’t expect that” and we play on for a couple of plies. In <em>this</em> situation, where the moved knight has had <em>consequences</em>, it’s has definitely impacted the game state. And error correction consists of removing that inconsistency by either <i>un</i>doing, or <em>accepting</em>.

Is the entire campaign now not taking place in the blorb but only in the waiting room of the blorb? The blorb isn’t buffered. It’s our playground♥

<ul><li>oldest</li><li>most recent</li><li>most used</li><li>most interesting</li><li>least disruptive fix</li><li>least contradictory</li><li>most rules-compliant</li></ul>In the “ten plies after a pawn error” chess example, rewinding complies wins in these operators:

<ul><li>most recent</li><li>most used (if 10 is a big fraction of a [so far] relatively short game)</li><li>least disruptive fix</li></ul>I usually look at three things:<br/><br/>The magnitude of the error,<br/>the oldest datum,<br/>and the disruptiveness of the fix, if any.

                            Sandra is making sense to me here. I think the chess analogy is leading us astray, since there’s always a “correct” gamestate (or, at least, a way to determine incorrect gamestates). That’s not the case with fictional material. <br/><br/>For instance, if I write down some material (a dungeon, my character background, whatever), but I learn that one of the players had a bad experience this week (e.g. a loved one was diagnosed with cancer), and I change that material when I present it so as not to upset them, we have no way to ascertain clearly which is “correct”. In chess that would be cheating. In our game, it’s likely totally good and fine.                        </div>

No, the game state was correct before, and you've used a technique to change it to a new correct state, and then pretend like it was always that way.<br/><br/>I don't think this is one of those ideas that is either correct or incorrect. I think your model is one way and mine is another, and I think mine is useful and you think yours is useful.<br/><br/>You haven't convinced me that falsities in the game state is at all useful.

According to your definitions, those moves aren’t being made. Only “attempted”.

The error correction might involve undoing those moves depending on the specific circumstances of the error.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
Hrm. Are you mixing up the metaphor or am I missing something? Operators require the data structure to be correct, uncorrupted, but the data inside them might be incorrect. I can't imagine an operator being able to work on a corrupted data structure: for example, the game rules say to subtract damage from hit points, but the character sheet (and game) has somehow lost its concept of hit points (the entire player group is new to D&amp;D and missed that section somehow).                         </div>

Oh! Well, that's close to my position but not <i>exactly</i> correct. <br/><br/>It's more that our ability to be "wrong" about the game state, with no repercussions, shows it to be an illusion.<br/><br/>I have seen no reason to believe otherwise, at this point (with the possible exception of mathematically or logically provable statements, based on real-world cues).<br/><br/>That's what I meant here:

Yes. But. Getting to that was like pulling teeth for crying out loud!<br/></div></blockquote>
The language you use - and, even moreso, Adam's language - confuses me totally. It sounds like bizarre hyperbole, and I don't know how else to interpret it.<br/><br/>In comparison, I found Vincent's use of "offscreen canon gamestate" somewhat more useful, since we don't need to make claims about its "realness" in order to use it for game design. (And also because it's much more specific in application, and demonstrated at least partially via game design example.)<br/><br/>Hmmmm.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should follow up on the discussion Adam and I were having (with my list of criteria/possibilities), before it got derailed with all the various drama.<br/><br/>I'm not at all sure how else to proceed; that was my attempt at an entry point.                        </div>

                            I'm going to try to answer Dave's question, just to see if I'm getting this right or not.<br/><br/>My best understanding of Sandra's view of "game state" is that "Bart's eyes are either blue or brown" is the correct answer; our commitment to using that NPC eye color chart limits the "fact" of eye colour in the game state to those two possibilities (which are both equally possible and therefore equally "true" or "untrue"), and the actual, true colour is revealed the moment the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>My best understanding of Adam's view is that none of those answers are correct:<br/><br/>Instead, the game state contains the *true* colour of Bart's eyes, and at some point we will discover it, and it will have been there all along. Our decision to use a chart and to roll on it is our way of "discovering" that eye colour, but if we changed our mind and used a different Technique, instead, we could be "discovering" something entirely other than blue or brown. In either case, that "eye colour" would have been in the "game state" all along, just unknown to any of the participants in the game. The game state can't be "wrong", so it contains the true eye colour, and always has.                        </div>

                            As per the original meaning of game state, David, the answer would be either "no information about Bart's eye color at all yet" or "Bart's eyes are either brown or blue", depending on your group's convention about how roll tables are used and interpreted.<br/><br/>(IE, at one table, a red dragon will be on the encounter chart if and only if there is a red dragon in the area; in another table, entries on the chart may mean nothing at all until rolled during play.)<br/><br/>Not sure how Adam would answer.<br/><br/>(I prefer to think in terms of <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22157/reference-frames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reference frames</a> these days, SIS / MIS / PIS / Game State all being examples of particular frames, but that doesn't seem to have caught on with anyone else yet.)                        </div>

I hope that if you answer this question I've come up with, it'll clue me in.<br/><br/>If we have a table that determines NPC eye color, and its entries are Blue and Brown, and we haven't yet rolled for NPC Bart, then what exists in the Game State?<br/><br/>"Bart's eyes are blue"?  <br/>"Bart's eyes are brown"?  <br/>"Bart's eyes are either blue or brown"?  <br/>No information about Bart's eye color at all yet?<br/><br/>And, in this example, why would we care about which one of these it is that exists in the Game State?</p></div></blockquote>
In my Game State, it depends on what we roll. Since you haven't rolled yet, you don't know what the Game State holds. Once you roll "blue," you will know that the Game State always held "blue."<br/><br/>The Game State can only be known through Exploration (Techniques).

Yes. Precisely.<br/><br/><br/><b>Paul,<br/></b><br/>Here's another way to think about it:<br/><br/>I write an iPhone app. It has a button and the phrase, "What's the frequency, Kenneth?". When a user presses it, it prints "42." I created the program using a special compiler that picked a random number and inserted it into my code, such that <i>even I don't know what it will print</i>. But, trust me, it will always print "42."<br/><br/>You install the app and ask me, "What's the frequency, Adam?" <br/>Adam: "I don't know, Paul! Press the button."<br/>You press the button. It says, "42."<br/><br/>What was the frequency before you pressed the button? <br/><br/>What if the randomizer ran once when you pressed the button, and never changed again after that? Say it said, "99.9."<br/><br/>What was the frequency before you pressed the button?                        </div>

My Game State is basically Vincent's "offscreen canon gamestate," developed further as an idea.<br/><br/>I can't remember if I made any claims about it being <i>real</i>. If I did, I can walk them back. Like, I've said it's an abstract concept, haven't I?                         </div>

I don't use them because my model doesn't need MIS or SIS, and because Game State and PIS are things of entirely different <i>classes</i> for me (i.e., they're not similar enough to call them both "frames").                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>Here's an attempt to convince that the Game State probably <i>should not</i> contain errors.<br/><br/>Adam, Bai, Cian, and Diana are playing D&amp;D. Adam and Bai believe Elminster's eyes are blue. Cian and Diana believe Elminster's eyes are gray. They investigate a murder mystery, and eye color comes up, and the question of Elminster's eyes comes to the fore. Obviously, someone is wrong.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to me that the Game State would contain both:<br/><br/><i>Elminster's eyes are gray.</i><br/>   --- and ---<br/><i>Elminster's eyes are blue.</i><br/><br/>If both are in the Game State, it's more like A+B were playing in a different Game State than C+D. And it might feel that way to them.<br/><br/>However, they can use Exploration to determine the Game State here. Look it up in a book, roll a die, pick one they prefer. Elminster's eyes are actually gray, because I say so. Now they have the truth: gray.<br/><br/>The false predicate has no purpose. It was never true that Elminster had blue eyes. Two people didn't <i>realize that</i> till just a minute ago, but that doesn't change the truth.<br/><br/>In your model, does the Blorb also contain every other false fact, like "Elminster's eyes are frogs (false)"? Where does it stop? Is it only filled with things that players believe? If so, how does it contain anything the players don't know yet?                        </div>

[…] You haven’t convinced me that falsities in the game state is at all useful.</div></blockquote>Please address the “waiting room of the blorb” example when the error is in the first session of a 75 session campaign.<br/><br/>Also the whole checksum/version controll issue that you proposed; I don’t think that squares with what we’re actually doing in practice.<br/><br/>We discover two contradictory data: the demon’s name is Alabaster and the demon’s name is Mary. We don’t have a previous version of the gamestate to rewind to and we can’t undo all the interactions with Alabaster. <em>In this particular example</em>, we happen to know which datum is the oldest (the oldest notes, Mary). And, several low-disruption correction operations comes to mind:
<ul><li>change the demon’s name to be Alabaster, changing the canon for that first few appearances when the demon’s name hadn’t been spoken</li><li>change the transcript of the conversations “Let’s say we were calling the demon ‘Mary’ in those scenes”</li><li>change the demon’s name “Let’s say your characters did believe it was Alabaster but that wasn’t the demon’s <em>true</em> name”</li></ul>We don’t have check sums or version control. We have contradictory data and we want to resolve&amp;remove the contradiction as soon as it’s discovered.<br/><br/>I have an idea for a compromise. Since you’re hep with sets.<br/><br/>Let’s introduce a new set: a subset of the game state that only contains correct data. This can reconcile our models.<br/><br/>I’m going to call it “g-correct”. Not “canon” because the canon game state can contain contradictions; contradictions that we are eager to resolve as soon as anyone at the table finds out about them because we don’t want quantum keeps in there.<br/><br/>If there is an error in the first session campaign of a 75 session campaign, that “g-correct” subset is very small. The name of the planet was misspoken as “Torril” instead of al-Toril. So everything has been going on on the wrong planet. I.e. nothing has been happening in the “g-correct” subset for 75 sessions. Then when the error is discovered and we go “oh the correct planet is actually al-Toril. Let’s fix it by saying that all of this was actually going on on al-Toril instead of on ‘Torril’” and then g-correct suddenly grows as the correction in made.<br/><br/>(Or, “I fell in love with you and your green eyes” and then went on this big old 75 session quest because of that love, and then we find an earlier record of your eye description and they’re blue? Or the Lord of the Rings but we found out that actually Bilbo had lost the ring prior and could never have given it to Frodo. Or Star Wars (i.e. ep 4) and we found out that the droids crashed on <em>Dan</em>tooine so they could not have found Luke and Obi-Wan easily.<br/><br/><strong>The issue is not how to correct it.</strong> In all of those examples it seems pretty straight forward (for us humans with human powers) how to change things so they’re good&amp;fixed. The point I’m making is that <em>the way we are playing the game is by operating on the game state</em>. That is the definition of playing the game. And not just operating on the “g-correct” subset because then we would’ve spent 75 sessions not playing the game. Or playing it on a buffer, on “the waiting room” of g-correct.)<br/><br/> </div>

Where does it stop? Is it only filled with things that players believe? If so, how does it contain anything the players don’t know yet?</p></div></blockquote>Contradictions are introduced into the blorb by mistakes: misstatements, misrememberings, misreadings.<br/><br/>(Btw Elminster’s eyes are blue-gray <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-dd/heroes/elminster" rel="nofollow">according to the publishers</a> but of course things can be different from campaign to campaign. In my campaign Elminster is unfortunately dead. We all started crying when we found out.)<br/><br/>Let’s say we’ve committed to treating the book “Volo’s Guide to Irises” as canon and the DM has glanced through it and it looks nice but haven’t read it in detail. It contains the fact that Elminster’s eyes are blue-grey. So in the game state, the eyes are blue-gray.<br/><br/>Let’s say that by some mistake, the DM says they’re green (maybe reading the wrong page on VGtI) and Alice hears it. Bob, Carol and Ted are late to the session. Now because of the mistake/misreading, the game state contains a contradiction. Green eyes and blue-gray eyes. Later the contradiction is discovered and we try to resolve it. Maybe Bob remembers from one of Greenwood’s novels that the eyes are blue-gray. And I go nuh-uh, they’re green, let’s look it up in VGtI, oh, you’re right, ok they’re blue-gray.<br/><br/>The eyes never were frogs or potatoes.<br/><br/>Things enter the blorb at prep time. Actions taken by the characters change the blorb. (Perhaps the prep says “red door” and Alice in game paints the door black.)<br/>Contradictions can enter the blorb at prep time (maybe we put two different unread or sloppily-read books in the canon and one says the eyes are brown and one says the eyes are blue-gray).<br/>Contradictions can enter the blorb at playing time (maybe we forgot that Alice painted the door black and we keep referring to it as the red door until “wait a minute, didn’t I paint that door black a few sessions ago?” “Oh, yeah…”)<br/>And, contradictions can enter the blorb where one datum was entered at prep time and one was canonized at play time by a mistake or misreading.<br/><br/>For example, with DM &amp; Alice:<br/><br/>Alice: I sock Elminster right in his big old green right eye!<br/>DM: OK!<br/><br/>and later Bob, Carol and Ted enter.<br/><br/>DM: Bob, you see a big swollen eyelid around one of Elminster’s two green eyes.<br/>Bob: Green!? Wtf you smoking, you b___! Everyone knows Elminster has blue-gray eyes! All true fans know that! Fake geek girl confirmed!<br/>Ted: Yeah, time to hand in your screen, you loser!<br/>DM: Guys, guys, relax, I’ll double check. Glad I spent MSRP $49.99 on this wonderful volume Volo’s Guide to Irises… let’s see here… oh, ok, you’re right. Blue-gray. Alice, I misspoke earlier.<br/><br/> </div>

I have the same question. <br/>But also, even if theory states this, as a player I know and see we're rolling to determine color right now, and that there was no color information prior to this roll, either known or unknown to us. I can see the statement that the shield was always blue as a way to incorporate the roll into the game, but not as the literal discovery of a pre-existing fact.                        </div>

My preferred description/explanation would be like this:<br/><br/>* The frequency was not established until I pressed the button and the program generated that number.<br/><br/>* When we roleplay, we commit, in part, to believing in a consistent imagined reality, which means we commit to *pretending* that the frequency was [that value] all along.<br/><br/>I think that’s the most clear and verifiable description of the facts.<br/><br/>Saying “this is the true value, and that’s what it was all along” seems misleading to me. I don’t like theories that misrepresent reality; even if they’re really useful, they’ll limit us or lead us astray eventually.<br/><br/>In the case of Elminster, for instance, you say that “gray was the eye colour all along”, once it was determined.<br/><br/>What if, later in play, we learn that humans of a certain background grow up with blue eyes, which darken to gray at puberty? And, further, we determine that Elminster is of this background, too?<br/><br/>What did we gain by saying “they were gray all along!” earlier?<br/><br/> </div>

That's all fine, but the game state also exists in relationship to our time (outside the fiction/world). My intuitive understanding is that the game state was updated and the eyes colour entry added to it after the roll. I'm talking about extra-diegetic time.                        </div>

                            Right. The eye colour was determined at 6:07pm on a Thursday here on Earth. In the Forgotten Realms, it’s probably been that way for a long, long time, but we don’t really know - see my post above. Maybe Elminster traveled to another plane of existence last week and is now wearing contact lenses.                         </div>

                            All of this is because my Game State isn't a collection of facts that were inserted by player belief, as Sandra's Blorb seems to be. My Game State is the actual truth of the five components of Exploration, and it only needs one version of the truth to be useful to anyone (unless someone writes a rule that cares otherwise, but those are very rare in real game texts, but see the FR example below).<br/><br/>This works not just with Setting and Character (where all our examples have been) but also System.<br/><br/>Like, when you ban paladins from your game, you have two way to do it:<br/><br/>1. You create an event within the setting that kills all the paladins at a point in time, like in Forgotten Realms and its D&amp;D-edition cataclysms, to rationalize the System change in Setting terms.<br/><br/>2. You just say that the setting never had paladins. The System state changes and it's as if it's always been true in the the Setting that there aren't paladins.<br/><br/> </div>

Everyone's PIS was just wrong, and they played that way till they determined that they had been wrong.<br/><br/>Now, in your waiting room example, you specifically chose to call it an error, not a difference. So you're saying that in session 75, they know they were wrong before. So the true game state was always "Elminster's eyes are gray" from session 1. They just didn't do any Exploration that sussed out the truth until session 75.<br/><br/>That is, the code didn't interact with that data. If it did, arguably, it would have told the group, "You're wrong, dummies!" <br/><br/><i>And here's where I proffer a new idea: The Engine runs in people's heads, acting on PIS, not the Game State. That's how it can continue to process on incorrect data. I haven't thought through the implications of this yet.</i>

I don't like it. I offer this alternative:<br/><br/>Techniques are often run in parallel by multiple participants, but on their own PIS. This is an imperfect process, as people are not perfect computers and the rules we use are often vague and many times unblorby. <br/><br/>However, there's a lot of communication at the table when a technique is used, and it's a synching-up point that the participants use to make sure they're all on the same page. Roughly, it's redundant distributed programming with comparison of results to ensure correctness. Usually, this helps catch errors. "That's a 6, Adam, not a 9." In that case, Adam rolled a die and read the value (technique) and you watched me roll the die and read the same value, but saw something different, and mentioned it. <br/><br/>Players may think they're running the same techniques in their head, but actually be mistaken about which technique applies, so they're running different ones simultaneously, sometimes coming up with different answers. "Elminster gazes at you with his sea-blue eyes." "Wait, blue? I thought they were gray. You said they were gray 75 sessions ago." "Oh, I forgot. Elminster gazes at you with his smoke-gray eyes..." There, the technique used is more complicated. Probably something like your blorby ladder principles, with "reference canon what came beforeth" winning over "if you don't know and it doesn't matter, and don't have a table for it, make up something plausible."  GM-Adam's memory is crap and he didn't remember it being established, so he made something up, but Sandra-player remembers goddamned everything and reminded him it was already established. Implicit in the conversation is the priority order, probably pretty sacrosanct to all RPG groups.<br/><br/>

Except that we don't play the game by operating on the game state. We play the game by operating on our own copies of the game state. <br/><br/> </div>

Essentially, my issue is that your model does not contain a single source of truth. Mine does.<br/><br/>When someone runs a game set in <i>The Forgotten Realms</i>, there is some kind of understanding that we're going to pretend that <i>the world is real and sensible</i>, that there is continuity and truth about it. Knowing that the setting contains a person named Elminster, you can ask questions like "What color are his eyes?" and expect that <i>there is an answer</i>, even if no one knows it.<br/><br/>My Game State is that platonic source of truth. It only contains true things. It's the wellspring from which Techniques draw truths out. Falseness only comes out of it when people run the Techniques wrong, or if they read or remember the results incorrectly. Then they store those falsities in their own personal copy of the Game State, called the PIS.<br/><br/>If a person makes a mistake about the color of Elminster's eyes, that's their own mistake, and they don't feed it back into the Game State. However, they continue to run Techniques on their own PIS, getting more and more wrong results, till finally someone else notices the discrepancy and they hash out the issue and figure out what is right.<br/><br/><b>Obviously</b>, the real CPU here is people's brains and the real RAM here is people's memories. The Game State is a platonic ideal of truth that doesn't exist as a real thing, but it's a useful model for me. Likewise, the Blorb and Gloracle are not actual things, but useful ways of thinking about memories and techniques and rules and processes.<br/><br/><i>I think my diagram, with abstract Techniques working on some abstract Game State like some perfect computer, is very misleading.</i> <br/><br/>And here I get back to Ron's apocryphal "eigenvalues / eigenstates / eigenvectors" comment, which I still cannot find, and I point to it and say, "Yes, that's what is really happening, and it's hard to diagram, so I took a shortcut, and now look at the mess I am in!"<br/><br/>If you're going to take a shortcut and <i>centralize</i> the the ephemera of play (the transcript), the agreed-upon collection of procedures (the system), the established canon (the components of Exploration), then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why centralize the errors</span>? The errors never occur at the central location. They are transcript errors of some kind on the way into a person's head. <b>If you are going to have any concept in your model of a PIS, then errors belong there, not in the middle, not in the Game State, not in the Blorb or Gloracle.</b><br/><br/>The central location of stuff contains:<br/><br/>1. True facts known by one or more players. (true-facts-known)<br/>2. False facts believed by one or more players. (false-facts-known)<br/>3. True facts unknown to any player at all, but to be determined by technique later on. (true-facts-unknown)<br/><br/>But not:<br/><br/>4. False facts unknown to any player at all, and never determined by any technique later on, because why? (false-facts-unknown)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</span><br/><br/>1. Sandra knows that Elminster has blue-gray eyes.<br/>2. Adam believes incorrectly that Elminster has gray eyes.<br/>3. No one knows yet that Elminster has good eyesight (assume it's true).<br/>4. No one knows yet that Elminster has bad eyesight (assume that's false). Knowing a false fact is not a desirable thing.<br/><br/>I argue that if your central location of stuff contains true-facts-unknown, then it has no place for false-facts-known. <br/><br/>Aesthetically, mine makes more sense because of this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://towerlands.world/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Game-State-vs.-Blorb.png"/><br/><br/>Or are you saying the blorb contains <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> false-facts-unknown, too. Or that the blorb does not contain true-facts-unknown?<br/><br/>Or are you not worried about the additional complexity of the three-out-of-four model?

My preferred description/explanation would be like this:<br/><br/>* The frequency was not established until I pressed the button and the program generated that number.<br/></div></blockquote>
So compile-time randomization is fine but run-time randomization is totally different, even though they have the exact same result?<br/><br/>What if I told you that in the real software world, real random number generators are super rare and instead we use things like pseudo-random number generators that take an integer "seed" and always produce the same sequence of numbers that humans aren't generally able to predict? That is, knowing the seed and the algorithm, you would always get the same number the first time you rolled it and saved the result. So we could guarantee a 99.9 or whatever, if we just did the math--but we didn't.<br/><br/>The thing is, it's often hard or even impossible to know at what point something was established. A single roll of a die is only ever going to produce one result. We just can't predict the future to see it roll a 42. So in the time before the roll, the die was going to roll a 42; in the time during the roll, it was rolling a 42; in the time after the roll, it rolled a 42. The result was always 42 and will always be 42. Just because <i>you don't know yet</i> doesn't make it a fact.<br/><br/>And it's not that useful to say, "well, humans don't know, so let's say that the game state doesn't know either." Why have an abstract game state model that doesn't know? Why? I declare that it knows, and that it's always known, and that people just get it wrong a lot when they transcribe things into their own heads or use the rules to try to probe the game state.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>* When we roleplay, we commit, in part, to believing in a consistent imagined reality, which means we commit to *pretending* that the frequency was [that value] all along.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
Yes, absolutely. The Game State model presumes that it has the answer, and when you say "let's pretend it was that all along," you're just <i>aligning your expectations with the Game State</i>. 
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Saying “this is the true value, and that’s what it was all along” seems misleading to me. I don’t like theories that misrepresent reality; even if they’re really useful, they’ll limit us or lead us astray eventually.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
The only real things in the model are the people and their imperfect memories, some dice, some rule books, and the pizza. Everything else is abstract. <br/><br/>As I've argued with Sandra, I don't feel that it's at all useful to imagine a Game State that stores wrong answers. I also don't feel it's at all useful to imagine a Game State that doesn't know the answers.<br/><br/>Because the game state doesn't contain a part where Elminster's eyes were actually gray and another part where Elminster's eyes were actually green. The game state has exactly one value for Elminster's eye color: gray. That you believed they were green is just a transcription error.<br/>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In the case of Elminster, for instance, you say that “gray was the eye colour all along”, once it was determined.<br/><br/>What if, later in play, we learn that humans of a certain background grow up with blue eyes, which darken to gray at puberty? And, further, we determine that Elminster is of this background, too?<br/><br/>What did we gain by saying “they were gray all along!” earlier?<br/></p></div></blockquote>
This is moving the goal post. This is an example of a technique to reconcile a true fact and a false fact, such that false fact can be made true.<br/><br/>This is not an argument about "what color are Elminster's eyes?" You're saying "Elminster's eyes changed color." Now we can talk about when they changed color, and what color they used to be, and what color they are now, and why they changed. All facts within the game state, each with one and only one true answer.<br/><br/>This is not unlike what TSR/Wizards did to the Forgotten Realms between each D&amp;D edition, killing off deities and changing the in-game laws of magic to rationalize that the new rules revision created inconsistencies and errors in the game state. Those sweeping changes did, in effect, change the game state (in a meta way for thousands of play groups who accepted the canon change) permanently, with only one new set of true facts. The old facts don't need to stick around anymore for players of the new edition, even if Ed Greenwood's group yelled at him (true story) and said "That did not happen here!" so he didn't accept the canon changes (that he didn't write anyway) into his home campaign, so his group's game state remained as it used to be.                        </div>

                            So Paul, when you say "more accurate" do you mean the timing of it? The fact that the character's action and your button-pressing coincide in time?  I'd argue that that's still about your feeling.  (And would concur with your preference, btw.)  ... Or is it wrong of me to be interpreting this rolling (button pressing) as representative of a <i>character action?</i>  Because that's how I saw it.<br/><br/>If you <i>weren't</i> seeing it as representative of a character action, then it's just about determining a diegetic fact, right?  In that case, I'd look questioningly at Adam (who seems to be the GM in this example), wondering why he's asking me to press the button instead of doing it himself.  If this is a trad game, he reps the world, I rep my PC.<br/><br/>Corollary: Does your feeling about this change if it <i>does</i> represent a character action (on the part of your PC)?<br/><br/> </div>

                            Re: waiting room example.<br/><br/>You’ve addressed unrolling <em>one</em> ply of error.<br/><br/>We went on an epic quest because of those brown eyes! I made several example where <em>the entire goings on</em> is based on the mistake.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If there is an error in the first session campaign of a 75 session campaign, that “g-correct” subset is very small. The name of the planet was misspoken as “Torril” instead of al-Toril. So everything has been going on on the wrong planet. I.e. nothing has been happening in the “g-correct” subset for 75 sessions. Then when the error is discovered and we go “oh the correct planet is actually al-Toril. Let’s fix it by saying that all of this was actually going on on al-Toril instead of on ‘Torril’” and then g-correct suddenly grows as the correction in made.<br/><br/>(Or, “I fell in love with you and your green eyes” and then went on this big old 75 session quest because of that love, and then we find an earlier record of your eye description and they’re blue? Or the Lord of the Rings but we found out that actually Bilbo had lost the ring prior and could never have given it to Frodo. Or Star Wars (i.e. ep 4) and we found out that the droids crashed on Dantooine so they could not have found Luke and Obi-Wan easily.<br/><br/><strong>The issue is not how to correct it.</strong> In all of those examples it seems pretty straight forward (for us humans with human powers) how to change things so they’re good&amp;fixed. <em>The point I’m making is that the way we are playing the game is by operating on the game state.</em> That is the definition of playing the game. And not just operating on the “g-correct” subset because then we would’ve spent 75 sessions not playing the game. Or playing it on a buffer, on “the waiting room” of g-correct.)</p></div></blockquote>Or, your words for it, “running Techniques on their own <abbr title="personal imagined spaces">PIS</abbr>”. For seventyfive sessions the entire campaign is only running Techniques on your own PIS! And “g-correct” is almost completely empty for the entire campaign because our “syncing up” operations have been insufficient or erroneous.<br/><br/>The whole point of this <em>model</em> is that we are operating (via the gloracle) on <strong>one shared-2 data structure</strong>. <small>Obviously you can go bishop Berkeley mode and deny the Ding an sich and then <em>everything</em> is a PIS, our dice and pencils and chairs are also something we operate on through our respective PIS. But we chose the word <em>model</em> on purpose when describing the blorb model. It’s a mental <em>model</em> of the goings-on that is useful for productive &amp; blorby &amp; practical <em>game design</em>.</small>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Essentially, my issue is that your model does not contain a single source of truth. Mine does.</p></div></blockquote>Correct, that is the difference.<br/>You seem to have a pretty good grasp on my model.<br/>I’m glad it’s being understood fully.<br/>I would rather that we got on the same page and used the same model.<br/><br/>So many primitive screwheads out there on the internet and here we are a handful of people who <em>almost</em> get it. But aren’t on the same page. And like… what’s the use… it’s exhausting. It’s like being on a desert island but then being in a fight on that island.<br/><br/>My model was created from observing what has been going on in practice in our actual play.<br/><br/>Which is as follows, and I’m sure you know, but, just to be extra clear:
<ul><li>When we wonder something about the blorb we consult the gloracle who gives us answers about the blorb.</li><li>The gloracle includes practical procedures and heuristics for correcting contradicting data.</li><li>Those procedures &amp; heuristics need to be invoked kinda often tbh</li><li>Those procedures &amp; heuristics <em>practically involve selecting between contradicting data</em> rather than reading or accessing an ideal</li></ul><em>because</em><br/><br/>the gloracle is our cave wall. And as much as I love and obey and respect and yield to and worship the gloracle, we sometimes fuck up when operating it. Gödel style.<br/><br/>The error-free–ideal <em>is inaccessible</em>.<br/><br/>The fantastic and wonderful blorb that is the platonic ideal that our gloracle lets us cave-wall shadow puppet access, is a multifaceted and wondrous and manifold thing. We do not deliberately put quantum keeps in. But. Contradictions (or at least things that to our mere human eyes appear as contradictions) have arisen in it.<br/><br/>And why do I claim this, you wonder? I’m not really giving any new arguments at this points and neither are you, we’re still in “nuh-uh” mode I guess. Repeating ourselves.<br/><br/>But I’m just observing how we <em>interface</em> with the blorb and with the gloracle.<br/><br/>In practice.<br/>What is the systems architecture in actual use.<br/>With measures in to try to prevent contradictions, detect contradictions, correct contradictions.<br/><br/>I <em>wish</em> we had a <abbr title="single point of truth">SPOT</abbr> to refer to, but we just don’t (not to disparage our beloved gloracle in any way). We can’t “sync up” with the SPOT. We can only sync up with each other. Synchronize our watches deep in the trenches with no satellite or whatever, just our own wonky old clockwork.<br/><br/>I’m not saying <em>time itself</em> contains contradictions. Except it kinda does <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23relativity&amp;Mode=like">#relativity</a><br/><br/>I’m saying <em>time-keeping</em> can contain contradictions. The <em>data structure we actually can access and operate on</em> can contain contradictions. It sucks that that can happen. I’m not deliberately putting in those contradictions.<br/><br/>By “time-keeping” I mean our concept of one o clock, five past one etc. Time itself is obv one thing but our “map” of time is another.<br/><br/>Uh. I think we are still in semantics land I guess!<br/><br/>We’re not really in disagreement on how this actually <em>works</em> (almost, read on). Just what to call the various cranks and gears of this big clockwork.<br/><br/>One disagreement is the whole “checksum” things. Which, we don’t have. In Magic at <abbr title="rules enforcement level">REL</abbr> <abbr title="ordinary water">LSD</abbr>: “Did I play a land this turn?” “I don’t know, man, I’m tripping balls rn…” <strong>Sometimes you just <em>can’t</em> go back to the pristine and immaculate and faultless game state.</strong> You just have to live with some entropy bits in there.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Or are you saying the blorb contains <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> false-facts-unknown, too.</p></div></blockquote>The blorb can contain unknown contradictions yes. So my quadrant matrix is all blue. The good old “S2 over the mountains” example for how we get unknown predicates into the blorb. And those sets of predicates can certainly contradictions. This actually happened in our own campaign just a few weeks ago, when there was an error on one of the maps in the module that made it contradict the text in the module.<br/><br/><small>Also you are using the phrase “my Game State” a lot but your old <abbr title="LiveJournal">LJ</abbr> blog post doesn’t use that word. It’s a word we were using. And that, like, Magic nerds or w/e have been using for a long time. You keep going “OK Sandra’s blorb works like that but my Game State works like this” and its like you chose the most pessimal name. I’m trying to be <em>polite</em> to everyone else by choosing weird names and not eat up name space. But you chose the word we were already using i.e. you set yourself up for maximal name space collision. Kinda frustrating! But I don’t want to fight, I want us to get on the same page!</small><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

I back this 100%<br/><br/>I've been uncomfortable with where Adam was going in this thread but having trouble nailing down *why*, and also super hectic / busy (I have a child now!) without much time to clarify my own thoughts, and here you've done and nailed it all down perfectly.

How about "ideal game state"? (Sounds a heck of a lot more appealing than "g-correct".) And now we can get back to talking about regular old blorby, messy, post-modern game state♥<br/><br/> </div>

                            I like both "platonic game state" and "ideal game state".<br/><br/>I have yet to see what the purpose or advantage of conceptualizing of such a thing might be, though. We've established (I think and hope) that the "platonic game state" isn't *real*, so now it comes down to figuring out whether the idea can be useful. At least, that's how I tend to think about these things!                        </div>

                            Platonic Ideal Game State = PIGS?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seems like the purpose of conceptualizing the PIGS is specifically so we can discuss how the real game state is different.  It provides a more precise way to talk about "errors" in the ROBMPGS, and how blorb can exist despite not living inside a PIG.                        </div>
