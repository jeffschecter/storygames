I think he's read something like 80 of them.  Lately he's been bummed out by the crumminess of the Dragonlance movie trailer.  And I said, "Hey: you used to game, I still game - let's game together sometime over the holidays, and I'll do this Dragonlance thing for you."  And I'm wondering about how to do it using <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> as a one-session game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not as bad a fit as it may sound: from what little I remember of the original novels, there's a post-apocalyptic world, where swordsmen and warlocks scramble for wreckage from the bombed-out ruins of prior civilizations.  The gods are silent as false prophets spread blasphemous doctrine.  Amid the rubble, people cling pathetically to old traditions, or revert to barbaric savagery.  A new army is abroad in the land, promising a restoration of order, prosperity, and piety -- under the lash of the conqueror, with the racial vermin subjugated under the master race.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm drawing a bit from "Dictionary of Mu" and "Charnel Gods" here, but I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing.  Suggestions &amp; criticism welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Demons Are</b> creatures/people/objects/ideas/ghosts from the pre-Cataclysmic world - probably, things related to Dragons (as the dragons, the gods, and the cataclysm are all wrapped up in each other.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Lore Is</b> knowledge of the ancient world, particularly dragons.  There's a strong element of Stuff Man Was Not Meant To Know going on here - the past civilization was destroyed precisely because it mastered this lore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Sorcerers Are</b> people who, for one reason or another, know more about Dragons/the Gods/the Past than they should.  They might be scholars, madmen, or tomb-robbers...<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Humanity Is</b> - hmmm.  I was originally just thinking, "doing right by other people" and leaving it kind of intuitive, but if someone can think of a tighter definition based on the foregoing, I'd be grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>At Zero Humanity</b> - you become the Harbinger of a new Cataclysm, ala "Charnel Gods."<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Sorcery Is</b> - Hmmm, what should this look like?  What's it all about?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108651/#Comment_108651" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T06:44:08+00:00" title="November 17, 2007  6:44AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2007 9:39AM by James_Nostack.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Stamina Descriptors</b><br/>\nQue-Shu Barbarian<br/>\nSon (or Daughter) of Solamnia<br/>\nOgre-kin<br/>\nLife is Toil<br/>\nAthletic<br/>\nArcane Secrets<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Will Descriptors</b><br/>\nFearless Kender<br/>\nLover<br/>\nMurderous Wrath<br/>\nDoomed Courage ("Destiny" rules encouraged)<br/>\nLeader of Men<br/>\nMad Ambition<br/>\nAghar Half-Wit<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Lore Descriptors</b><br/>\nDeranged Minoi (price at -2)<br/>\nInhuman Survivor of a Bygone Age<br/>\nHalf-breed Child of the Old Ones<br/>\nOrder of High Sorcery<br/>\nDragon-Schooled Prophet<br/>\nTomb-Robber<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Example Skill-sets</b><br/>\nRenegade Wizard<br/>\nFalse Prophet<br/>\nKnight of Solamnia<br/>\nDragon High-Lord<br/>\nImmortal (Inhuman Survivor or Half-Breed only)<br/>\nGuttersnipe<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Run-Through of the Companions (as a double-check)</b><br/>\n<i>Raistlin</i> - Weakling, Mad Ambition, Order of High Sorcery<br/>\n<i>Caramon</i> - Ogre-kin + Athletic, Lover, N/A (Tomb-Robber in the second trilogy)<br/>\n<i>Sturm</i> - Son of Solamnia, Doomed Courage, N/A<br/>\n<i>Tanis</i> - Athletic, Lover, Half-Breed Child of the Old Ones<br/>\n<i>Goldmoon</i> - Que-Shu Barbarian, Lover + Leader of Men, Dragon Schooled Prophet<br/>\n<i>Tasselhoff</i> - Athletic, Fearless Kender, N/A<br/>\n<i>Flint</i> - Life of Toil, Doomed Courage, N/A<br/>\n<i>Kitiara</i> - Daughter of Solamnia, Mad Ambition + Lover, Dragon-Schooled Prophet                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108653/#Comment_108653" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T07:08:58+00:00" title="November 17, 2007  7:08AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2007 7:47AM by James_Nostack.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Ideas for Demons</b><br/>\nTower of High Sorcery (desire: Knowledge, need: to psychologically mutilate sorcerers)<br/>\nDragon (desire: mayhem, need: eat people)<br/>\nGhost of Fistandilus (desire: power, need: ???)<br/>\nLord Soth (desire: ruin, need: reminders of what was lost) (Soth is, in fact, a Lich per the rules in Sorcerer &amp; Sword)<br/>\nSilver Arm of Ergoth (desire: creation, need: precious metals)<br/>\nTakhisis<br/>\nPaladine<br/>\nMishakal<br/>\nHiddukel<br/>\n<br/>\nanything else come to mind?

He had this thing going on with the Elf woman and the Human woman.  I think he chooses the Elf woman, but under what circumstances?  What's the big deal to him, as a character, in making that choice?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso: I don't remember very much about Caramon and Raistlin.  At some point Raistlin goes into Hell to conquer the universe, and Caramon tells him that everything will be destroyed, and it's not worth it - and Raistlin repents, or something.  So: power isn't worth it, if you lose everything you love.  (I <i>think</i> that's the lesson, as it makes sense that Raistlin gains power by transgressing against his filial bond and then relinquishes power to redeem that bond, but I can't really remember.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did Sturm choose to die?  Was that a good death, in the context of the story?  Did anybody learn anything from that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - what was up with Lord Soth?  To what extent did his choices play into becoming a monstrous undead thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108702/#Comment_108702" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T22:52:53+00:00" title="November 17, 2007 10:52PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well they're all choosing Good vs. Evil in a pretty... heavy handed way.<br><br>Tanis chooses Laurana (Good, slightly less sexy) over Kitiara (Evil, VERY sexy)<br><br>Caramon chooses to try to redeem Raistlin instead of try to kill him (evil)<br><br>Raistlin grapples more with evil (fulfilment of ambition) over good, choosing to abandon evil because he suddenly sees it's self-defeating, but it's tempting for him<br><br>Sturm chose to make a stand to try to defend people (good) regardless of consequences, and even challenged a self-serving establishment of good in order to try to get it back to its ideals.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108704/#Comment_108704" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T23:56:47+00:00" title="November 17, 2007 11:56PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That reminds me, one of the Dragonlance sourcebooks had an alignment-tracking chart you were supposed to use.
