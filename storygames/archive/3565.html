Checkitout.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more trains you have on hand, the more freedom and (in a way) power you have over the game.  You can freely take on route-contracts, because you know that you've got the resources (given enough time) to complete them.  As you spend trains, you inevitably weaken and constrain yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nEXCEPT!<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after the first person runs out of trains, <i>the game ends</i>.  Anyone who was still hoarding their trains, waiting to deploy that power later, is left out in the cold.  There is no later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the first game (when people inevitably get caught with their pants down by the end-of-game) I've noticed that this acts as a very effective countdown clock:  People keep an eye on the number of trains out, and they <i>adjust their behavior accordingly</i>.  If all players have many trains then they make slow, careful moves for long-term benefit.  As somebody gets closer and closer to the finish, players ramp up their own speed, making moves that aren't necessarily <i>perfect</i>, but which aim at their objectives and spend their own resources down to keep pace with the forerunner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt strikes me as a very elegant mathematical solution to the problem of "climaxing together" ... how in a game with separate story-threads, it can be devilishly tricky to get the threads to all come to a boil at the same time.  If each player has a thread of their very own, and they know that when the <i>first player</i> runs their resources down (which means ramping their drama UP!) it will mean the imminent end of the game, they'll make sure to keep pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this sound like it'd work?  What kind of advice and/or feedback would people need in order to be able to keep tabs on these resources and to adjust their own actions to suit?  What else could it do, beyond just synchronizing climaxes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80350/#Comment_80350" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T05:52:22+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  5:52AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, you'll need some visible measure, like the little trains.

Whenever a protagonist "burns out" the game is <i>potentially</i> over, but it's up to the group to decide.  In every game that I've played that reached that point (including a few con games) we've always decided to end it after the first burnout, but it's not a mandatory thing like in Ticket to Ride.

It's all time-activated, and like that.  I also like that it's statistically self-limiting:  Eventually, if you give the GM back too many resources, you will lose the ability to win a conflict against him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80463/#Comment_80463" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T15:55:16+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  3:55PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game I'm designing, Keystone, does this in a way, by having each character have multiple destinies, with each destiny having a track that is furthered by playes bidding in to them.  While you have multiple destinies, one of those destinies has a relationship to The Bane (the Keystone destiny) that brings the game to a conclusion.  Since only one player can complete his/her Keystone destiny, the other players have to make moves that would either prevent him/her from ending his destiny as soon as he'd liked, or if that's not possible they need to be sure to push their story so it can climax before or simultaneously.  In the playtest that we're in the midst of, we have two characters very much pushing to fulfill their Keystone destiny, so the energy level is ratcheted up pretty high and leading to some very exciting gameplay in the story and some very interesting metagame decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80894/#Comment_80894" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T11:48:58+00:00" title="July 12, 2007 11:48AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this is useful, but in the retro space shooter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_Forever" rel="nofollow">Warning Forever</a>, you get an infinite number of lives but only a limited amount of time.
