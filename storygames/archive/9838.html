Because that's how he rolls.  <br/><br/>I wrote in two sets of characters, with the thought that a group could choose to play a French game or an English game.  They would play very differently!  In my heart of hearts, I'd love to see both factions run simultaneously at adjoining tables, with two GMs, interacting and swapping seats as necessary.  That'd be really interesting and fun.  Another idea would be to play as a single group over half a dozen sessions, switching sides and characters occasionally.  <br/><br/>Let me know what you think!  Experienced Blackbird players, if you see potential problems with the tags, I'd love to hear about them.  I think everybody is pretty competent in their own way but you never know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218736/#Comment_218736" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T10:24:27+00:00" title="July 16, 2009 10:24AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason...this looks awesome.

Short form is that it was really fun, and surprising how similar events turned out like real world history: Jumonville was murdered by a native american while failing to make diplomacy with Washington, which inevitably led to the French and Indian War.  Everyone had a good time, and some people (me included) learned a bit about local history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221991/#Comment_221991" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T18:38:00+00:00" title="August  1, 2009  6:38PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Plus Washington got it on with Marie-Amable!

Louis de Villiers was cut because he did not quite fit the scenario as presented to the players.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote> Why did you decide to have Half-King be in love with Margaret Montour instead of Marie-Amable?</blockquote>\n(I assume you mean Shingas.)<br/><br/>Looking at the relationship map, it seemed like French Margaret only had one significant relationship (to Washington) whereas Marie had enough going on.  It also seemed like the French group and the British group needed more interconnections, so moving that relationship killed two birds with one stone.  (French Margaret also became Jumonville's half-sister for an additional complication.)\n<blockquote>You mentioned playing for an hour and a half - how much prep was there, and how prepared were the players?</blockquote>\nA lot of prep for me as GM, but very little for the players.  Most players knew a small amount about their character the night before so they could do some costuming if they wanted.  Most players arrived around 7:30-7:40 and read their character packet as we waited for the last player.  I gave a brief speech about the situation of the time period (France versus England, Delaware versus Iroquois, the surrender of Fort Prince George) and a rundown of the rules.  We started actual play by about 8:00.  So about a half hour of prep time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222095/#Comment_222095" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T15:18:01+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  3:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the background info.  I did mean Shingas (sorry), and your reasons make a lot of sense.  I might add some monkey-wrenching for people trying to run both the French and British games simultaneously - having Margaret Montour have connections across the divide would be very good in that case.  In a straight British game, of course she and Washington need to be the main event.  She's more interesting as a character than Marie-Amable anyway, as far as I'm concerned!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242798/#Comment_242798" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T16:19:17+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  4:19PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played Bloody Forks again!

I was a little worried that two players (Trent and Franklin) weren't havin as much fun as the others.  But Trent's player said afterwards that he had a lot of fun, and Franklin's player turned out to just be very reserved (he GMed In A Wicked Age later, and was very laid back and quiet doing so).<br/>\n<blockquote>What was your favorite part?</blockquote>\nProbably the Washington/French Margaret plotline.  It had like everything I'd want from the game, right in that storyline (failure to communicate, personal issues complicating the larger political situation, witchcraft, clever plans, a hero being taken prisoner, etc.)<br/>\n<blockquote>Does Trent need to be rewritten to make him more fun?</blockquote>\nTrent wasn't an unsuccessful character, so much as one that required GM attention to keep him involved and relevant.  <br/><br/>Some of this was because the pairings left him without a Washington to rebel against.  And he gt paired with Van Braam, whose player was quite vocal and active.  So maybe if the party had reunited or paired off differently (or Trent been played by someone different), Trent might have been a more active, successful character.<br/><br/>When I ran Bloody Forks as a Larp, Trent did just fine.  There, he had his own entertaining schemes to show up Washington and would occasionally deliberately mistranslate what Jumonville said to provoke people.<br/><br/>If you do revise him, perhaps replace the Secret of Leadership with something else?  Trent's Secrets are both a bit passive.  Or replace the Key of John Bull? (I left off the Key of John Bull, but it got roleplayed anyway.)  Another Key pulling him in some third direction might work... I guess John Bull is supposed to make Trent want to work with Washington while his other Key introduces antagonism.  In my Larp version, Trent had a goal of "Get Out of Here Alive", which might mean helping the British, or it might mean abandoning them in battle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242993/#Comment_242993" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T06:54:19+00:00" title="November 21, 2009  6:54AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's good advice.
