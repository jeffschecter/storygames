And when choices are made, I follow up with consequences that makes the world come alive around them.<br/><br/>This... is <i>working the imaginative field</i>, deepening the theme and strengthening the conflicts, by simple and effective means. The players never have any reason to doubt my intentions. I will support their characters in scenes of harmony, in dealing with their everyday life, to make it easy to build a social base for their personality. But I will challenge their characters in scenes of conflict, to see how their personalities plays up in crisis. Through the characters, I will also strive to challenge the players themselves.<br/><br/>The point is to make players engage in the game, and to have them produce an emotional content that is in support of the game theme.</blockquote>\nI long for this particular sort of player engagement the way a pig longs not to be bacon.

I love what you are saying on "pushing the characters agenda with no certainty". You go a long way in showing how that opens up the imaginative field for emotional content. These are really good observations, matching my experience closely. I see that you have gone deeper in analyzing this theme than I have, even though I've been mulling over it for decades. You way of putting this together, examining and explaining it, is very, very good.

In a mystery or adventure novel or film, the capability of the main character is normally what's in question. I mean, what's Miss Marple's agenda? To catch the killer.  But everyone's lying and got something to hide, so <i>can she</i>? (Spoiler alert: Yes.)  <br/><br/>So games in which you go on adventures or solve mysteries are often about capability, and the infinitely different sorts of capability or incapability someone can have. If you're looking at more straightforward forms of drama, Jesse is right that capability isn't really the main showpiece and systems that focus on it aren't a good match.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346586/#Comment_346586" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T06:03:48+00:00" title="October 21, 2011  6:03AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>games in which you go on adventures or solve mysteries are often about capability</blockquote>How come you bundle <i>adventures</i> together with mysteries?<br/><br/>And are you sure the mystery-genre is so very different, in role-playing games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346587/#Comment_346587" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T06:28:52+00:00" title="October 21, 2011  6:28AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2011 6:29AM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jesse">@Jesse</a>: that essay was <i>awesome</i>.
