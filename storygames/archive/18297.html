I may find myself in the near future running games of it to players who might be folk who've played DnD and are thinking of buying DW. My first impression of the game has given me pause as to what my sales pitch to a DnD player might be.<br/><br/>I came to the game with very indie sensibilities. I picked a bard with high wisdom as that they seemed to be most able to succeed with the 'give us more plot' move that would move the story on. Another player seemed to have a more traditional approach with a character optimised for combat and damage.<br/><br/>Perhaps because of my character choice, during the game, I found combat mostly irrelevant. There was a lot of flash and great descriptions, but there was little actual tactical challenge (I'm an ex-wargamer) to get to grips with.<br/><br/>I focused on plot and intra-party relationships, pushing love triangles, redemption and corruption of innocence. As a result, I and the combat focused player barely touched paths (despite having an interesting bond between us) and could well have been at separate tables. That's fine, of course.<br/><br/>Given all this, I wondered if any gamers with experience of DnD or similar games can share their thoughts on what sold them on DW. Is there sufficient tactical challenge and I just happened to miss it in this single session? Or was it a loss but compensated by other aspects of the game? Or something else entirely?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412449/#Comment_412449" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T07:06:49+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  7:06AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be curious to hear what others (with more DW experience) have to say, but one thing that occurs to me is that "tactical challenge" in most *World games comes from the MC/GM; it's not really baked into the rules. The tactical challenge is all fictional positioning, in other words. <br/><br/>So you could easily play "by the book" and not really experience it.

My own take is that DW will be a miss for a D&amp;D gamer who wants challenge; you want players who play D&amp;D for the drama. The tricky part to my mind is that D&amp;D fantasy with the dungeoneering commando parties doesn't interest me per se, so the game isn't too well-suited for some players on that regard, either. Still, one may assume that as long as we're talking about D&amp;D players, that latter problem won't be an issue - presumably they like D&amp;D fantasy well enough even if they don't like the challenge aspects, as otherwise they wouldn't be playing the game at all.<br/><br/>Evidently there are plenty of folks who'd love D&amp;D to be less aggressive and in-your-face about challenging you all the time. My brother eats up DW, for example. It seems to me that the best strategy for gathering a group is an honest pitch that focuses on this issue: do you want to play D&amp;D without the constant fear of failure, focusing on e.g. how pretty your elf or how brave your paladin is?  Do you want your D&amp;D to be a joint exercise in fantasy storytelling, rather than a struggle against constantly looming danger and death? If that sounds appealing to a given D&amp;D player -and there are plenty of these D&amp;D players, could even be a majority - then it seems to me that they're exactly right for Dungeon World.<br/><br/>Regarding combat vs. social roleplaying, it's worthwhile to note that players focusing on combat are not necessarily in it for the danger and challenge. I've seen many D&amp;D gamers who love the accoutrements of violence, but break down and go sad and bitter if the combat turns against them and humiliates or ruins their character. My brother is like this, for example. Dungeon World is just fine for these players as well, as they're not looking for challenge, but rather they just want to play soldier. It's a big part of both D&amp;D and Dungeon World, combat. You might take it as background rhythm for whatever other content there is in the game. Sort of like how Star Trek has an embedded background color of space fleet officery, even if it rarely contributes much to the actual content.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I imagine that a player who came to the table to "win" would grow bored with DW once they figured out the nature of the game. This wouldn't happen for a couple of sessions, presumably, as DW has all sorts of superficial bits that evoke D&amp;D-like challenges. For this reason I think it's a good idea to pitch DW clearly on the issue of challenge: if a player despises the idea of just playing D&amp;D for the dollhouse aspects, then they're probably not a good fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412451/#Comment_412451" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T07:22:16+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  7:22AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something Adam wrote\n<blockquote>With groups familiar with other games, I've asked "Tell me about the last time we played AD&amp;D / Pathfinder / 4e" and listened to them reminisce.

The Regiment has proved that to me beyond the shadow of a doubt, but it is ALL ABOUT FICTIONAL POSITIONING. If the MC isn't really prepared to really go all-out on the positioning and describe where everyone is and what they're doing at every moment, if they aren't interested in the details of combat, then the players who are interested in those details and tactical stuff will be unfulfilled. And even if the MC is interested in fictional positioning and tactics, it's still a different beast than the boardgame-style mechanical and physical positioning (with actual minis in real space) of 4E and even 3E. Some people will love it; others may feel lost or just not be as interested. And if people haven't played these types of games before, it may be difficult to know whether they're interested before they try it out. Finally, the game text only gives you so much help in playing a really deep tactical game that relies on fictional positioning, so if you're not comfortable with doing that already, it may or may not work for you.<br/><br/>So, basically: you can have a tactical game, and it can be really deep, but you have to 1) have an MC that's excited and able to go there, 2) have players who can get really excited about fictional positioning in combat or action sequences, and 3) be able to pull it off. Otherwise, yeah, the game will probably be more about drama and adventure than the tactics of combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412456/#Comment_412456" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T09:03:18+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  9:03AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Related discussion about tactics in DW over here; <a href="http://ww.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17822/can-someone-help-out-with-dungeon-world/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ww.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17822/can-someone-help-out-with-dungeon-world/p1</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412461/#Comment_412461" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T11:10:16+00:00" title="April 23, 2013 11:10AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, wargamer here too.  I recently ran Dungeon World for a group including a friend who had never roleplayed before, and he wanted to see some more traditional D&amp;D to compare it to, so I ran some Pathfinder.  (I know, not classic, but I'm not old school and I don't want to learn 1E or 2E.)  This group likes the dungeoneering quite a bit, so we've even focused a bit on the "dungeon commando" style of play if I'm interpreting that correctly.<br/><br/>For that style of play, Dungeon World has the following benefits:  You don't have to learn the rules one iota, you just say what your character does.  Only the GM has to know the rules, and though it does take some time to learn Apocalyse World style, the newbie guide for Dungeon World works really well for getting the nuances across.  So, fast system mastery, and only one player really has to know the guts of the system.  You can play Pathfinder that way too, but making characters took a lot longer and they had less cool stuff baked in (e.g. bonds.)  (If bonds aren't "cool stuff," then yes, wrong crowd.)<br/><br/>Dungeon World gets rid of the "Ok I take 20 on the roll" business.  Success or not isn't the point -- hard moves and 7-9 results keep things going.  Defy danger rolls are, in my experience at least, more about conflict resolution than task resolution (that is still a thing, right?)  You can do either style or either system, but DW lends itself more to conflict resolution style mechanics.<br/><br/>You might be able to boil it down to this:  I like playing wargames.  I also like playing D&amp;D, but when I do, I don't really like to use a grid.  DW is a game where you don't need to visualize a grid to make the combat make sense -- you just need to visualize the tactical maneuvers in a bit finer detail in order to make sense of the combat.  (This isn't strictly true, the game is robust to abstract interpretations like "Ok you hit him for 5 HPs, now he attacks your friend, what do you do?" -- it isn't ideal but the game doesn't completely fall apart.  Essentially, I think about DW as a system where you call every shot, and unlike a traditional system that isn't "bad.")  <br/><br/>And there's no "how do we do a bull rush again for me trying to shove this bugbear off a cliff?"  I bought the physical book but it is mainly just a prop, after reading the PDF there's essentially no reason to reference it during play.  (Ok, we do need to reference the basic moves sheet of course, but that's ok.)<br/><br/>If anything, reading DW will certainly make you a better Pathfinder GM -- going back and running Pathfinder after having read DW was a lot more entertaining for us due to what I learned from reading it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412467/#Comment_412467" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T11:58:10+00:00" title="April 23, 2013 11:58AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The tactics are there as much as any other game, but game come from the fiction that is being told.

The GM can make a move at anytime, he is not restricted by what the player does, but the move depends on what the player describes in the fiction. <br/><br/>We have been loving the game because we get everything we want out of a game action adventure game without the rules getting in the way.

And may not have been totally representational of a typical DW game.<br/><br/>Two things I did, that may have been wrong:<br/> <br/>1) Threw out my prep, to run the game in a more freeform manner.<br/><br/>2) Pushed for movie style sword and sorcery troupes. (I know this is kind of the point, but I went for this over common sense or tactics)<br/><br/>I have run Dungeon World before, and it was a different experience. Similar but slightly more tactical! This may have been because last time we used LEGO figures to represent the characters, so we knew who was where in relation to what, and how many enemies where in play, etc<br/><br/>That time it felt more like old-school D&amp;D, this time I was getting more into the crazy narration, and trying to discribe what was happening in the most flashy way possible. In the end we had the players battling a whole army, and I gave up trying to track HP, just called for the moves and narrated the results. I felt that this approach had mixed results in DW<br/><br/>it's a weird element of DW's design that it has old-school elements such as damage rolls. On a certain level you need to have all the monsters fleshed out before hand with level and HP decided, even to the point where most dungeons should be pre-generated, with different levels of challenge in each room. That to me, is at odds with the structure of AW games.<br/><br/>When I run Monsterhearts or Apocalypse world, I play to find out. Asking the players questions "So what did happen to that hot girl in class?" "Why is Balls so mad at you?" Then act on the player's answers, true you frame leading questions to push players in interesting directions, but they are still sharing in the group storytelling.<br/><br/>DW is the only game powered by the apocalypse that needs NPC stats upfront, all the others a name and a motive will suffice. So in DW it can be a little problematic if you are intent on freeform, play-to-find-out type play. When a player opens a door in a dungeon and says "what do I see?" It's not really ok for the DM to say "I don't know, what do you see?" Because It kind of makes the dungeon crawl type experience a bit pointless; (A massive pile of treasure!, the Pricesss asleep safe in bed!) <br/><br/>What you need to say is: " Three snarling Kobolds waiting to strike!" Because that's what you had planned to throw at the players at this point, (and they have 6hp and do d6 damage....)<br/><br/>If you wanted to make the game more tactical, my first step would be to think about the design of the dungeon. Older edition of D&amp;D had very little choice in combat: attack, flee, cast a spell, drop an item, use a magic item, etc. The challenge was actually exploring and mapping the dungeon, true tactical combat came a lot later (Feats, Charater builds, special attacks.) So think about where the fight takes place, "Skelton archers shoot across a ravine, do you return fire? Or defie danger to leap across?" "The floor is is covered in ice! How will you fight them here?" Or something like that but more interesting.  <br/><br/>In a fight, I like how the moves in DW flow together to create interesting "fictional instances" I love combat in games, but HATE tactical play in RPGs!  Wargames are cool but to me it's like playing a sport, you make the moves that will win the fight, even if they aren't that interesting. In an RPG I want to discribe how awesome my Charater is, or how terrible the bad guys are, I want the description to flow like we are narrating a movie fight scene, or something from an anime. I want my guy to get hit, so he can wipe the blood from his eyes, and seize the enemies weapon from their hand, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! Not something I would desire if I was playing to win!<br/><br/>Tactical choices can make a fight more engaging, (I really enjoy D&amp;D 4th edition) but often at the cost of invovlement in the narative. I find I really want a game where I can jump around like a child, describing all these cool moves, and for that DW isn't actually the best choice, because its still built on a foundation of D&amp;D, admittedly with much more focus on shared narration. <br/><br/>Long post, but I really wanted to vent about this, slight ramble. Hope you can discern my reality!<br/><br/><br/>TL;DR<br/><br/>Depends on how you approach the game as an MC, as to how tactical it will feel!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412526/#Comment_412526" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T07:17:38+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  7:17AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Evidently there are plenty of folks who'd love D&amp;D to be less aggressive and in-your-face about challenging you all the time. My brother eats up DW, for example. It seems to me that the best strategy for gathering a group is an honest pitch that focuses on this issue: do you want to play D&amp;D without the constant fear of failure, focusing on e.g. how pretty your elf or how brave your paladin is?  Do you want your D&amp;D to be a joint exercise in fantasy storytelling, rather than a struggle against constantly looming danger and death? If that sounds appealing to a given D&amp;D player -and there are plenty of these D&amp;D players, could even be a majority - then it seems to me that they're exactly right for Dungeon World.</blockquote>\nI kind of disagree with this. I've never played a game of DW that was about how pretty your elf is or how brave your paladin is, or one without the constant looming danger of death.<br/><br/>The games that I've played and run are usually about problem solving in some form. Maybe on the small level of finding a way across a trapped hallway without dying, or maybe on the larger scale of finding a way to deal with two conflicting armies.<br/><br/>If you pull your punches as GM and ask a lot of questions that make the characters unique (the pretty elf or brave paladin) then this could certainly happen, though.<br/><br/>So, yeah, if that's what you're going to run DW as, be honest about it. But I'm not sure that's what everyone's getting from it.<br/><br/>I think there's sometimes a little baggage with DW and being an "indie" game. When I most recently played the bard, I didn't push the love triangles and drama. We wanted bonds and their associated relationships to be icing on the adventuring cake, not the focus of play. So I played the bard as a bit of a self-promoting self-proclaimed leader. <br/><br/>It sounds like in the OP's case there may have been a mismatch in expectations between the group?<br/><br/>I tend to pitch the game a lot like Adam: this is our toolset for how we were playing D&amp;D. It's about focusing on what's happening to the characters and letting the rules flow out of that. It's about challenges and problems and consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412618/#Comment_412618" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T22:09:21+00:00" title="April 24, 2013 10:09PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, DW is just a regular old fantasy adventuring game, it's not super-tactical (because the die result/hard move economy is fairly immobile), so people who want that stuff won't get much out of it.

I'm probably biased by the players I've got--and I've had far too few sessions--but they tend to step up and flesh things out, particularly when I cue them by describing the monsters using particular actions, like swooping down to attack them from behind or trying to push them into a bottomless pit.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412817/#Comment_412817" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T18:05:56+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  6:05PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Dimaension_X">@Dimaension_X</a> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412841/#Comment_412841" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T00:46:51+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 12:46AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2013 4:29AM by Noofy.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've always lapped up the principle of <b><i>make maps leave blanks</i></b> with delight.
