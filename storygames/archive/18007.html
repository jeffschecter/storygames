Maybe this has been done before or is just over the top and not required.<br/><br/>Ok the idea! <br/><br/>Your in play you cant get into a scene or your the quiet type or your at the other end of the table what ever, you want to do something!<br/>Play a card.<br/>To the Gm or to a player? not sure which could be situational.<br/>The card procedure is in play. It stops immersion but I think it could also teach/ help interaction?<br/>The card interrupts play allowing you to possibly play another card. e.g Interrupt card followed by Microscope ( The images are off the web and not mine. The Microscope image is from the great game <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>So you have a discussion and fail to agree. The Jury card could be played if this fails its down to the GM.<br/><br/>Would this idea help groups with issues? could it be used for a period of time until it becomes second nature then removed.<br/><br/>see attached images of a few ideas for cards<br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a635/Pau88Bucket/blanks9unlockedwhite4copy_zps159a9fd9.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a635/Pau88Bucket/blanks9unlockedwhite3copy_zps89380bf0.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406847/#Comment_406847" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T13:31:24+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  1:31PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure.
