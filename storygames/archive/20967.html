A streamlined system that works. I wasn't a bit taken with the effort they took with the spaceship battles, mostly because it feels (like all these kinda of battleship systems) like one player playing the arm, one the leg, one the brain, and one the heart.<br/><br/>I'm pretty picky when it comes to systems, but this one is all right. Some good parts, and nothing to really complain about besides all the useless dice to roll. Not that dice in themselves are useless, but succeeding on only 6 on a d6 is not the best idea - even if it's fast to read the dice pool. Oh, and assisting is pretty meh.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>A short summary of the system:<br/><br/>\u2022 Add an attribute (a total of 6) and a skill (~12).<br/>\u2022\xa0Roll as many dice as the result. Sixes are successes.<br/>:: 1 success: barely makes it<br/>:: 2 successes: makes it<br/>:: 3 successes: makes it reaaal good<br/>\u2022\xa0Can re-roll all non-sixes if praying to an icon (god), or activating special ability.<br/>:: if re-rolling, the game master gets a token to use to mess with the characters.<br/>\u2022\xa0Can assist someone else by rolling dice. All sixes are turned into dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
