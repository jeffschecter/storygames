A few people we knew had played it, but no one owned it or had the means to get a copy. So imagine my thrill when I discovered that it's now available on Lulu courtesy of James Ward! Metamorphosis Alpha was an early RPG that took place on a colossal interstellar generation ship gone horribly wrong. Elements of the design later found their way into Gamma World and Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. Now I have finally read this thing and my response is a resounding WTF. I can't decide if this is brilliant or awful or possibly both. <br/><br/>First weirdness: you can play a human, a mutated human, or a mutated animal. Humans have an extra stat: "leadership potential." This is similar to Charisma in D&amp;D, but mutants can't have it, and if you become a mutant, you immediately lose the stat. It measures how many followers you can have, and also the chance that some random mutant will join you as a follower if you ask them. Mutants apparently emanate a mysterious social discomfort that prevents them from being effective leaders, even to other mutants. It's sort of unclear where this might go in play; maybe somewhere awesome?<br/><br/>The game includes the utterly insane tables of mutations we all know and love from original Gamma World, some pretty crazy weapons and equipment, and extremely deadly and weird monsters and hazards. Mutations are chosen at chargen rather than rolled randomly, which is important. There\u2019s radiation everywhere, which can be very deadly, but also has a (small) chance of generating a random mutation. If you get killed by radiation there\u2019s a chance you get a random mutation instead.<br/><br/>The examples of play are bizarre in the extreme. None of them seems to faithfully represent the rules they are meant to illustrate, but instead are run through with unwritten procedures and assumptions that can be guessed at, but are not spelled out.<br/><br/>The generation ship, the Warden, is roughly described in the first section of the book: about 30 miles long and 10 miles high, having 17 levels of various sizes and descriptions. The ship is described according to its specifications at the time of construction construction. The referee is invited to decide what their own version looks like, post horrible disaster. This is super cool and endears me to the game immediately.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Warden, the play scale in Metamorphosis Alpha is also very strange. It's not spelled out, but from the clues and examples given, it is neither megadungeon nor wilderness, but rather a sliding scale that goes very quickly up to the very enormous and down to the level of dungeon-crawl minutia. For example, in the extended play example, the party emerges from a massive freight elevator complex in to a corridor 1 mile wide and several miles long. They proceed to the right-hand wall, enter a door. In the next moment, we\u2019re at the level of opening a desk drawer, specifying which drawer, who is opening it, and how are they opening it, and what horrible things transpire as a result. It\u2019s worth noting that the game has some Moldvay-style generator tables that I think are what you\u2019re supposed to use to figure out the local details to scales under 1 mile square.<br/><br/>The bundled mini adventure is the same. It starts by specifying the mind-bendingly huge megastructure where the adventure begins and where the party might go, and then details the consequences should the party fail to think to examine the bed they woke up on.<br/><br/>It\u2019s the megastructure style of play that blows my mind more than anything else. The maps in this game are typically \xbc\u201d graph paper, 1 mile to the square, encompassing a ship level that might be 30 miles long, 8 miles wide, and 1 mile high. A given 1 mile square could be a medical complex, part of a major city level, with full facilities for handling trauma, long term care, and storage for medical supplies. This is something more than \u201cKeep on the Borderlands\u201d writ large. What does the referee do when the PCs enter this square? If I get the game right, you start with the general description of the megastructure and then immediately zero in on the fictional details of where the PCs are and what they do through a mix of referee improvisation and random tables.<br/><br/>My take on this game is that it is a raw relic from an earlier time, containing much lost wisdom, but also much darkness and obscurity. The rules are painfully unclear and in desperate need of basic copy editing. The subtler procedures of play are not spelled out, and each individual group will probably have to jink and house rule their way to coherence. This is not <i>necessarily</i> a bad thing.<br/><br/>Has anybody else acquired and read this or possibly played it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Greentongue" title="Greentongue"><img alt="Greentongue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Greentongue">Greentongue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363130/#Comment_363130" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T17:28:37+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  5:28PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2012 5:29PM by Greentongue.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It provides a setting and a structure.

For one of my early takes on doing the adventure at Gary Con I used Google Earth to put the con hotel at the center of a map scaled to be as big as a Warden level, and it was really dispiriting to see how tiny things became; SO MUCH STUFF fits into any given hex.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a big fan of MA's incoherence. It's a lot like Chainmail where you have mass combat and man-to-man combat and fantastic combat and no guidance about which to use when; likewise MA has a Chaosium-style stat-vs-stat comparison percentage for mental combat, and a d20 weapon class vs. armor class system for weapon combat, and a 2d6 procedure for archery, but a great many cases fall into the cracks. I really like this because it forces fiction first; you can't just reach for a rule without thinking, you have to say "oh right, the game has provided me with a toolkit of different resolution systems, is one like the thing that's happening here or should I use them as examples to make up my own?"<br/>\n<br/>\nStuff I know about procedures of play:<br/>\n<br/>\nAt conventions at least, Jim Ward runs it at fantasy fucking Vietnam scale; you will never travel 30 miles because traveling 30 feet without stepping on carnivorous grass or touching something imbued with deadly radiation is a huge achievement. He is a funny gameshow host so this was enjoyable, but I had to call bullshit on his story that although he is the legendary killer GM, Gary and crew never died because they were superior players. I think they probably were great players, sure, but much more importantly they knew his tells and the unspoken procedures of how to get information out of him. My best attempts (including drawing the scene as I thought he had described it and asking "so is this what my character sees?") didn't ever give me enough to go on to make an informed choice, so the gameshow flavor came from picking the lady or the tiger blind.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Clark said Jim assumed everyone would do like he had and make ships called the "Clarkstar" and "Allisonizonia". As a young 'un Chris happily dug in and filled a binder with maps of his own ship, which I was dying to see. Chris said that what was obvious to him was that this generation ship sunk into savagery thing was bunk; look at how complex a 747 is, there's no way it would still be running smoothly after a systematic breakdown as described. His take was that what had really happened was that the ship passed through some mystery field that gave everyone false memories of a whole lifetime of being little mutants or humans; in fact, the campaign started immediately after the accident. Chris also said that what he found compelling was that MA had a defined end goal. Either you were going to find a way to fix the ship, or you were going to escape before it all went kablooey.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: human leadership, I read it as the unchanged being still crew members; mutant humans or animals retain an understanding (perhaps informed by the way that the ship treats crew different) that they are to be obeyed. In some of my recent games I have the ship provide human crew with a pink potion; once you drink it it dispels the Clarkian illusion and you remember that you are Tony Dowler, tell me about what happened in your life between 2012 and when the ship sailed and why you signed up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363174/#Comment_363174" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T19:46:31+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  7:46PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2012 7:51PM by zircher.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran it back in the day and loved it very much.

That's totally applicable to this style of play. Another impression I get from MA is that it's quite possible to go entire sessions without encountering a monster. The environment is a major element of play.
