                    It's been a while since I've posted about DEAD, my "let's explore the emotional side of a zombie apocalypse" game.  As a refresher: The game is split into two parts - the first is a boardgamey bit where the characters are fending off the undead and trying to escape the city (and accomplish other goals that they pick up along the way), i.e. 'The Escape'.  The second half is called an 'Interlude', where the characters have gained temporary sancrtuary and interact with each other to advance the emotional plotline of the game.  Doing so (and doing so well) gains the character Recovery points, which bring down the otherwise fatal levels of Fear, Anger and Sorrow (i.e. damage) that they are carrying around.<br/><br/>During each of the Escape phases, one of the players is 'The Dead' - they play the antagonists of the story, the shambling or raging zombies.  A player becomes The Dead when their character dies, flips out or goes suicidal/homocidal.  Their character is dragged along by the rest of the group (or, hey, abandoned for lost), and they play the zombie horde.  <br/><br/>As I have it currently envisioned, each square on the map is given a numerical score, 1-10.  This correlates with the zombie threat in the area, and provides the player of The Dead with a number of points (say, x * 3) worth of dice to throw at the players in the shape of zombie attacks, locked doors and other complications to their plans, whatever they may be.  My dilemma is how to guide and/or mediate the spending process that The Dead player has at their disposal.  <br/><br/>For example, the group enters a hospital square to score medicine and shelter.  The square has a Threat score of 6, and so the Dead have 18 dice worth of threats to throw at the characters while they try and negotiate the twisting corridors.  Technically speaking, they could just wait for someone to open a door and *BAM* hit the character with 18 dice worth of zombie ripping the character's throat out.  (By way of comparison, no one character will have more than 7 or so dice at their disposal at any one time).<br/><br/>So I guess I'm asking if anyone has a different perspective that can help me out on this.  I like the idea of multiple obstacles tripping up the characters along the way ... but should I change it to some sort of scene-framing technique?  Maybe a number of dice rolled to represent the *number* of zombies, with another set defining another attribute of the scene, and each player must roll against the entire scene?  Or per-conflict, with each player getting their own set of dice to worry about?  Or some other mechanic, like a hand of cards, backed with dice to be played?<br/><br/>Help?                </div>

<p>Yup, yup.  Similar ground.  And because of that, I've been sitting here reading your post, trying to figure out what I can do to help.  Problem is, I really don't have a clear image of what's going on in DEAD.  Tell me what players do in the game.  Tell me how it starts, and how it ends.</p>

                            Perhaps you could require that the dead split their dice into "threat" (i.e. zombies) and "environment" piles.  Environment dice represent any situational elements in the area that come into play- locked doors, fuel drums, electrified fences, etc., and can potentially be used by either side.<br/>
<br/>
Once the number of dice are determined (by the Dead player), there is a conflict for control of those dice.  If the Dead player wins, the dice are deducted from the Living players action dice- the characters have run into a blind alley, and are trapped, like rats!  If the Living players win control of the environment dice, they've found something useful to use against the dead- a door they can lock behind them, a car with the keys in the ignition, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A strategic challenge for the Dead player is determining how many dice to use for the environment- they're useful, as they reduce the dice available to the other players, but it's risky, because it might be used against you.  <br/>
<br/>
Another factor that could be an influence in all of this is the team vs. individual angle- the Living players should be at a relative advantage if they stay together, and disadvantaged if they split up.  Perhaps the zombie gets all his dice vs. each party of individuals, so if they split up, the living have fewer dice against each threat?  In this case, the Living would want to stay together, and the Dead would want to use environment dice to split them up.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to see you're both working on a game I'd like to play!                        </div>

                            If someone steps out into a street full of zombies unprepared, there's no reason they shouldn't be torn to shreds in an instant.<br/><br/>Add a stat: Detection.<br/><br/>Before entering a zombie filled area, roll Detection to scout around.

                            I am working on something vaguely similar called 'What a shambles' essentially emulating the Shaun of the Dead film, in that the main protagonist has a romantic objective to achieve during a zombie apocalypse. I have done combat as a roll of a number of d6s.success = 2+. A 1 means one of the stats you just used is adjusted. There are three stats: Guts, Fear and Panic. When you roll a failure in a guts test, your fear goes up by one and guts drops by one. When you use fear and fail, your panic goes up by one which reduces all your dice rolls by one. Each point of panic reduces your dice further. There are also weapons you can use. The zombie threat is represented by a pool of tokens other players can push towards you to make things more difficult, but if they push to many, they must take some threat themselves as they attact too many zombies.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

                            Interestingly, all three games mentioned so far are significant departures from one another.  Plenty of fertile ground here.                        </div>
