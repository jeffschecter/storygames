This year it will be basically invite only and friends, but for next year I'm going to be looking more into how to run an apartment con.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've got 10 people on the invite list, and there's a decent chance most of them will show up.  If so, what the heck do I run?<br/><br/>Stuff on the top of my list: Wicked Age, Dogs in the Vineyard, Spirit of the Century, Universalis, Hero's Banner, Penny For My Thoughts, Primetime Adventures, and HeroQuest.<br/><br/>HQ and SotC seem best able, although character creation will take quite a while (unless I make pregens). I know* that Dogs breaks over 4 or 5 players. According to their books, that's way too much for Wicked and Universalis. Hero's and PFMT maybe, but it just seems like a nightmare number for both games. PTA could probably handle it the best, but that still seems like a lot.<br/>*(well, I'm told by Vincent, so I figure that's reliable)<br/><br/>I'm hoping we'll be able to split the group up, but since I'm the one who knows all the games, that might be tough. But we might also have some playing a board game while the rest role-play. Anyway those possibilities are more optimal. I want to plan for the best-worst case scenario (the worst-worst case is no one shows). Any suggestions or ideas or tips?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122385/#Comment_122385" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T12:17:16+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 12:17PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That'd a really nice size for two groups of 4-5, or even three groups.

Scales from 7 to 9 easily (+1 for The King, i.e. the GM/Host) and can go much larger with the supporting roles, but those roles are better-suited to more passive players or those really new to LARP, being less mechanically hooked into play (i.e. they are basically an ability and a loyalty; they don't play the Court game or have Goals beyond those of their controlling player). Should run about four hours, maybe more with rules explanations and briefings and such. It can also be successfully drifted into another setting, so long as "currying favor with the boss" is relevant: White House/Government; Mafia/Gang; Office Politics; whatever. Just find appropriate replacement art for the character cards (printed out and taped on) and, maybe, for the currency (Gold) and you're golden. Sure, you'll want to squint and rename a lot of the card stuff, but that's probably more fun to do on the fly rather than replace scores of cards.<br/><br/>As for tabletop RPGs that support a single group of 6 to 10 people... man, I dunno. <i>D&amp;D</i>? <i>Contenders</i>, maybe? You'd want something where a given instant of player participation is punchy and very quick, with little room for waffling or exploding detail; otherwise, a "round" of "turns" could easily take a half hour or more.<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122395/#Comment_122395" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T12:35:49+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 12:35PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Grey Ranks</i> is probably too fiddly to just pick up and run without someone who has internalized the rules for themselves, although I'd love to be wrong about that.  <br/><br/>I don't know <i>LLtK</i>, but David's definitely on to something with a more participatory thing.

The prep work for you is not insubstantial, but once play begins the gamemaster's role is to talk the players through conflict resolution mechanics, rather than actually coming up with challenges.  Most, if not all, of the conflict should be between the characters.  My own scenario, 'Quest for the Holy Grail' is an example:  up to eight characters from Arthurian legends start the game in the presence of the Holy Grail.  They each want it--whether for themselves or to present to King Arthur.  Ultimately, only one will get credit from the King for recovering it.  So the game is about who delivers the Grail to Arthur.  I use the full Duel of Wits rules, which is a mechanism for social conflict that can involve everyone who wants to be involved, and a modified 'Bloody Versus' rules for combat.  The scenario is very similiar to Burning Wheel's 'the Sword' scenario, although that is written for four players.  I just ran 'Quest..' at Dreamation with seven players, 2 have been playing BW since October; 1 had played BW once, and the other 4 had never played.  I think they enjoyed it; one participant pointed out that an advantage of the scenario is that most people likely have a passing familiarity with the Arthur stories and can relate to the characters.  I'll be happy to send you the prep I've done, although some of it will likely be scanned handwritten character sheets.    <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122407/#Comment_122407" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T12:59:01+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 12:59PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>InSpectres.</b> Two groups, one GM.

You can also get <a href="http://download.white-wolf.com/download/download.php?file_id=679" rel="nofollow">the rules online</a>, so your players can prep in advance--a good idea if you want to let them pick roles based on costuming capabilities or playstyle or what-not.<br/><br/>But, hey, it's your call.<br/><br/>Also consider <i>Diplomacy</i>--you might need to team folks up, after the starting seven (make teams for the countries that the rules advise you to drop in smaller games--those countries NEED the help!); or use one of the millions of custom maps and some other color counters, to fill out a ten-way board.<br/><br/>What about competitive format games, though? Four-on-four with co-GMs might be REALLY cool for some games.

Competitive games is interesting. I could see cooking up some system for doing DitV, four dogs vs four demons or something. I think that would take more work than I have time for this coming week.  Co-GMs doesn't really work since I'm the only one who knows most of the games well enough.
