                    I feel like there are a few conversations that are going on around my recent post, and I thought I'd break them up a little bit, and see what people think.  I'd like to see if what I'm thinking jives with what you all are thinking, or if there's anything that needs to get added/removed/changed, and then, if folks are interested, to split them off into separate threads (or not, if it proves difficult to really disentangle them that much).<br/>
<br/>
First, though, I'd like to say that I'm glad these conversations are being had at all, and that, in many places and by most people, they're being conducted in a pretty civil, and not entirely destructive (or reductive) way.<br/>
<br/>
1. Community: What is the role of Story Games as an internet community of gamers?  Who belongs and what are they supposed to be talking about?<br/>
<br/>
2. Language: What sort of language do we, as gamers on the internet talking about gaming, use?  How does the language we use affect other people and encourage/discourage them from participating in gaming discussions?<br/>
<br/>
3. Gender: Roleplaying has a perceived history of being a male hobby.  Does this influence the way we play, write, and talk about roleplaying games now? [Note: I broke this out as gender because that's what I was talking about in the thread, but similar discussions around religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation would certainly be viable.]                </div>

<p>It <strong>has</strong> been great to be able to talk about all of this in a civilized and polite fashion.  But as people come closer and closer to the idea of "Let's have a great big talk and discuss what Story Games should be," I'd like to point out that there's a fair amount of bias in <em>even presenting it that way</em>.</p>
<p>I think the best of people, so I assume that you don't see how you're slanting the rhetorical field firmly in favor of your own propositions.  I hope that you will accept this in the spirit of an observation and maybe some food for thought, rather than a criticism.</p>
<p>When you put forth the proposition that things like "Who belongs and what are they supposed to be talking about?" will be resolved or even refined by a discussion on the topic, you are <em>proposing a way that the board should be.</em>  You are proposing, roughly, that we should have such discussions and that they should be important to everyone.  Which is certainly <strong>one</strong> way to deal with the issues, but far from the only one.</p>
<p>Personally, I am totally happy for you to have such discussions.  Have a ball.  You can have a whole sub-forum for discussing how people should talk, as far as I'm concerned.  I certainly don't see how talking about such things, in and of itself, can do me any harm.  I'd even listen, and contemplate, and maybe ask for clarifications.</p>
<p>But I don't particularly want to put forth my own opinions on how people should talk.  Because, really, I'm pretty happy with people talking however the hell they want, so long as they afford me the right to do the same.</p>
<p>See ... here's the thing.  If you think those discussions are <strong>important</strong>, if you think that the discussions are <em>resolving</em> these issues rather than just examining them, then suddenly it is <em>not possible</em> for me to simply stay out of them.  Either I post <em>something</em> (which I'd rather not do) and then stand by it or else <em>by my silence</em> I give (at least in the eyes of some) tacit agreement that I will live by the boundaries that people set up.</p>
<p>Now that, again, <em>doesn't matter directly to me</em>.  The fact that (say) Bobby Sue believes that by my silence I promised to never use the word Macho again is Bobby Sue's problem.  I will remain Ã‚Â¡Muy Macho!  Bobby Sue cannot stop me.  But Bobby Sue can get all upset because she misunderstood my silence, and contrary to what people may believe I don't actually <em>seek that out</em>.</p>
<p>Out of courtesy, I might decide to occasionally post in such discussions, so that people won't later feel that I betrayed them later.  This post is one such courtesy.  The worrisome pattern I see (in many other places and increasingly <em>here</em>) is that when I post once, people <em>respond</em> instead of <em>listening.</em>  They don't just say "Okay, that's how Tony feels," inevitably someone says something stupid like "Well, that's a crummy way to feel!  I guess you're entitled to it, but only because you're entitled to be wrong."  And then they think, because they've provoked me, that if I don't respond it's because I am tacitly agreeing with their point.  Because if I disagreed with them, of course I would want to talk about it, right?</p>
<p>It can become a treacherous pit of quick-sand.  The person who wants to talk just keeps on talking.  The person who doesn't want to talk either has to grit their teeth and stay in a discussion that they <strong>hate</strong> or else just walk away from it and accept that people are going to feel that their silence indicates agreement (or at least lack of dissent).  You get threads where five or six posters are talking and talking, and then they think they speak for the other 295 of us, simply because we're not interested in keeping their discussion going by telling them we disagree.  It sucks.</p>
<p>Now, in all seriousness:  I do not believe things have reached that stage here.  But people seem to be taking step after baby-step towards that with grim implacability.  A vocal minority seems, to my admittedly biased eyes, <strong>determined</strong> to make that the default mode of conversation here.  Which, really, is just going to make them unhappy because, dudes and dudettes, I at least am <em>not</em> going to feel bound by any of these discussions.  I will, now and forever, listen politely to what people say, contemplate it, and then do whatever the hell I feel like doing without feeling obliged to justify it to anyone.</p>
<p>So:  Peaseblossom has raised good topics.  I'm interested to hear what people have to say, and I'll certainly think about it seriously.  I probably <em>won't</em> post again.  This is your one warning that, no matter what the talky-talky people agree upon, I'm still going to do whatever the hell I feel like.</p>

<p>I think I'd rather answer this question by what we actually <em>do</em>, rather than trying to make a pre-statement. I want to see what community emerges from the freeform, ad-hoc order. I guess the keep principle is that we're trying to keep everything sociable, informal and friendly. Beyond that, I read Andy's original Stickies, and I got the idea that, by default, this was either going to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a social, RPGnet-like adjunct the Forge</li>
<li>a more Forge-ish RPGnet</li>
</ul>
<p>I just realized what might be a clear question: "How Forge Are We?" That could be a good thread. There's the clear subtext that there's a great many Forge people here, but how much of that general thought do you need to personally digest and agree with to be here? My guess is that the answer is: not so much.</p>

<blockquote><i>1. Community: What is the role of Story Games as an internet community of gamers? Who belongs and what are they supposed to be talking about?</i></blockquote>
<p>What Tony and Brendan said.</p>
<p> I'm not sure that this question follows from the conversations about gender issues in language.  And I sure don't want it to.  I appreciate that language can and does offend people, and I always try my best to write and speak in a manner which will offend the least, but I hate it when I'm <i>forced</i> to write and talk that way.  Frankly, I say whatever the hell I want to say, and if someone doesn't like, then they can tell me to go to hell. And I'm fine with that.  I'm sure it won't be the last time, and it hasn't been the first.</p>
<p>I have to take issue with the questions as they are asked, and I assume you didn't mean to ask them this way, but, <b>to me</b> these quesitons seems to say: <i>Now that you've learned your lessons, Story Games, how will you apply the lessons that you've learned?</i> They sort of have (and no offense meant) the feel of a grad student teaching a freshman rhetoric class, and I think the vast majority of people on this forum are past that.</p>
<p>Questions two and three are interesting and maybe should be their own threads, but when combined with question one, I think it sounds like an agenda is being pushed that I don't buy into, and I would encourage people to steer clear of this kind of self-censorship agenda.</p> </div>

                            I thought that Peaseblossom was not trying to dictate questions we should be answering, but just observing what she's seen people talking about, so that we can try to separate the issues.  I, for example, care a lot about gender, but not much about language or what this community 'should' be about (except for a place where I can hang out with interesting people who care about games and stories).  I do tend to rant about gender issues in gaming, but that's because it matters to me! <br/>
<br/>
I'm a new member of this community, though, so I do hope that if I become obnoxious, someone will whisper and tell me.  I'm really enjoying the discussions here, but I don't want to be someone who makes other peoples' eyes roll.  If that's me, I'd rather you let me know.                        </div>

<br/>
I want this place to be a midway point between the noisy crowds of RPG.net and the work and direction of the Forge.<br/>
<br/>
We should be talking about gaming, odd ideas that we aren't sure about, links to other places that we think are neat and other discussions and just little mad ideas that don't seem to fit anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
2. Language: What sort of language do we, as gamers on the internet talking about gaming, use? How does the language we use affect other people and encourage/discourage them from participating in gaming discussions?<br/>
<br/>
I thought the whole macho thing wasn't a big deal, so I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
3. Gender: Roleplaying has a perceived history of being a male hobby. Does this influence the way we play, write, and talk about roleplaying games now?<br/>
<br/>
Of course it does, the last thing a fish anthropologist would write about would be water, right.  Who said that?<br/>
<br/>
But if I want to let my testerone flag fly, I'd like to be able to do that, especially if I do it in a way that asks for feedback and criticism.                        </div>

<p>I'm going to preface by saying none of this is a bad thing, and I'm glad we're talking about gender and gaming.</p>
<p>That said - a week or so ago, this place had a lot of discussion on a lot of topics about gaming, and I wouldn't say any of them dominated. Right now, it seems like half the discussion on here is about gender and gaming. And that discussion was started by and guided by a small subset of the posters here.</p>
<p>Is Story Games the place that we come to talk about gender and gaming? Is that what it will become? That's cool, if so. But that'd be my first question.</p>

                            Clinton, <br/><br/>As for that, money bet says it passes. Any forum will go through phases. When you get people thinking about a subject, you get people talking about a subject. Eventually you get worn out though, and things move on to other subjects. <br/><br/>Even RPG.net has variations in how many Exalted threads there are in a week -- from like one when nothing has come out in a bit to like a bajillion now that 2nd ed is new on shelves.                        </div>

                            I like what people are saying here, on all sides.
<blockquote>3. Gender: Roleplaying has a perceived history of being a male hobby. Does this influence the way we play, write, and talk about roleplaying games now? [Note: I broke this out as gender because that's what I was talking about in the thread, but similar discussions around religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation would certainly be viable.]</blockquote>
I'm sure it does.  And I'd love to see a thread on this. However, I've seen similar threads at RPGNet and The Forge on the topic, and the question of "How does Gender influence the hobby" is cool, but too broad to be meaningful: The threads tend to fill up quickly with about 3-8 parallel conversations and observations in gaming. And a lot of personal observations and witticisms.<br/><br/>I would love to see some of those above be addressed, but I'd love to see it in a way where:<br/>1) The threads focus on one specific question.<br/>2) The threads use real world examples, from your direct experience, and talk about actual games (using names, not just "RPGs in general" or "D&amp;D").<br/>3) We can rope Meguey and Emily into the conversations. &lt;--- This isn't anywhere near mandatory, but I'd personally love to see it. :-)<br/><br/>Also, yeah, as Clinton noticed theres a lot of threads on Gender right now. But yeah, it's the New Hotness to talk about right now. It's that time of the Mayan Calendar where, in a cycle, these topics emerge again and become interesting. I figure they have a half-life of about a month before they're talked out until the next Calendar Cycle, but still, there's some new thoughts, new games, and new ideas that have developed in the last 2-3 years that are probably worth crystalizing in discussion for the time being.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            As one of the 295, I come here because we can discuss game theory without it being tied to experiences, and the much looser ruleset for language and behavior. If I have to learn a bunch of new and seperate standards that I have to follow... story-games will likely lose it's use for me. I've personally stayed out of the gender conversation because I didn't want to hurt anyones feelings, but I want to actively state an opposition to attempting to reign anyone in, or changing the present status quo. While someone may dislike the title Tony has given his creedo (I do dislike it), his statements have been very clear on the meaning he is attaching to those words, and they do not disinclude women. Any discomfort is owned by the uncomfortable party.<br/><br/>If the price of not walking on eggshells is a sausage-fest, I am willing to accept that. However I would consider it non-optimal. <br/><br/>I would also like to suggest if the name is the only thing that is upsetting to people, attach your own name to the creedo and fight for mindshare.                        </div>

                            I think it's a bit unfair that people are accusing me, or a shadowy 'minority' of having some sort of secret agenda in regard to this forum.  I didn't come here to stifle you or tell you what to say or how to think.  This post, in particular, is pretty much just questions; yes, they're provacative questions, but the tone of discourse on much of this forum led me to believe that provacative was a good thing.  Perhaps I misread, and if so, I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
I also apologize to those of you who are tired of talking about gender and roleplaying.  Maybe the answer to your problem is to stop reading and replying to these threads; it's not as if all the other gaming conversations on this and other forums have ceased in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
As for the subject of community, I understand that most of you don't want to talk about it, and that's fine.  It seems a bit counterintuitive to me, but then I like my social contracts open and clear from the get-go.<br/>
<br/>
Andy, I'd be interested to see threads on specific gender and gaming issues as well.  Just don't expect me to start them.                        </div>

My impulse to to respond to you privately about these two paragraphs, but I'm a little unsure about what to say.<br/>

Honestly, I think I would be making unavoidably personal comments about someone I really don't know very well, which would be incredibly impolite.<br/>

<br/>

                            Word.  The only secret agenda that Jess and I have involves David Bowie and icecubes.  And now it's not even secret anymore (sorry, Jess!).  I can't speak for Brand &amp; Mo, though.  They're pretty devious.<br/>
<br/>
It's crazy how this conversation blossomed across the diaspora, blog-o-sphere, and various forums.  Even made it to RPGnet, I hear.  Way to go, Jess!  A lot of it was messy and not especially productive, but that's nothing new.  At least people are talking and (hopefully) thinking a bit.                        </div>

                            Wow--this has been a long conversation.  As a mere dabbler in these places, I have hesitated to jump on board...yada-yada, I'm posting.  Rather than answer any of the three questions directly, I'll respond in a slightly fuzzier manner.  In part, because the questions as framed by peaseblossom seem too big, nets so loose that all the fish slide through them.  In part, because my response is a little impressionistic.<br/>
<br/>
Do I occasionally use what has come to be described as macho language, including genitalia references?  Yes, but I do so exclusively in an all-male, relaxed social environs.  The only obvious exception I can think of are occasions with my wife.  Why?  Well, because everyone in that environment who knows me, knows how much camp is involved for me in that.  I use it with scare quotes, if you will.  If I want to make a meaningful statement beyond goofing and posturing, I drop the language and use words better suited to the task.<br/>
<br/>
This is always sticky online, where tone is more difficult to determine.  It becomes even more nettlesome when the words are being used as a vehicle of meaningful content.  People talk a lot about signal to noise around here--words like 'macho' are noisey and unfocused.  The buzz of conflicting meanings around them obscure the message.  That's not terrible for a 'relaxed' place like story games, but not ideal either.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like the indie game community should dig this kind of discussion.  If system matters, if the substrate of the roleplaying experience matters, can it be so wild to claim that words, the substrate of communication (which roleplaying is all about), also matter?  The clearer and more focused the words, the clearer the signal, the better the conversation becomes.  I'm not a fan of the political correctness police, but I far prefer them to the anti-pc response which essentially shuts down the process of clarification.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there is a pragmatic point in all this, one that doesn't have to evoke all the questions of pc-ness, though.  It's simply this: words matter.  As we talk, we find better words, just as we talk about conflict vs. task resolution, we find better mechanics.  No more, no less.  If we can open up our game mechanics to critical reflection, why not our words?  Especially (as peaseblossom's concerns point out) when those words relate to how people are able to access our ideas about gaming.  <br/>
<br/>
Peaseblossom's comments read like this to me (yes, *to me*): <br/>
<br/>
"this word macho is off-putting, loaded with too many meanings for me to sift out a useful one that I can put in my game theory sack and carry off.  Some of those multiple meanings are offensive to me, so I have an even harder time ignoring those to get to the meat of the discussion.  I think I am not the only one (and people agree).  Perhaps if you want to engage more people, you'll think of finding a better word.  The forums tone suggests that this is, in fact, one of the hopes of some people who hang around here.  Let's chat about that."<br/>
<br/>
Now, I think her framing questions were too broad, but I think the 'spirit' of them is good and (with better words, because those matter) there is some good stuff to talk about.<br/>

                            This is what I am seeing right now:<br/><br/>Jess made a post that said: "I am uncomfortable with this language and these ideas. Can we talk about this (not even asking anybody not to go there, asking if it was necessary)?"<br/><br/>And there was much offense taken.<br/><br/>Now, people are telling Jess that they are uncomfortable with her language and her ideas and are telling her to not go there.<br/><br/>and...<br/><br/>I also see that Jess has never, called for or even suggested any policy change around these issues. She has asked for those interested to have a discussion about what this community wants. Maybe that's important to her decision about staying here. Maybe she wants to understand, maybe she, like all 295 people on here want to have a voice that is as clear and strong as any other.<br/><br/>Now, from the looks of it, there are guidelines being given about how discussions that she is interested in (but not ones that others are interested in, apparently) should happen.<br/><br/>Doesn't anybody find this ironic?<br/><br/>Yes, there are a handful of gender threads going on... there's about 5 on the front page.... out of *50*.  A couple of them are facinating, and are really exploring ideas and experiences in a really helpful and useful way. For some of us, they're insightful and interesting. For those folks that are not interested are not forced to read them at gunpoint, what is the problem? (I mean, if you have someone forcing you to read forums at gunpoint, that's not something any of us can really help you with.)<br/><br/>There's also about 5 "credo" conversations. Why is one problematic and the other not?<br/><br/>Tony, you said: <br/><br/><code>It can become a treacherous pit of quick-sand. The person who wants to talk just keeps on talking. The person who doesn't want to talk either has to grit their teeth and stay in a discussion that they hate or else just walk away from it and accept that people are going to feel that their silence indicates agreement (or at least lack of dissent). You get threads where five or six posters are talking and talking, and then they think they speak for the other 295 of us, simply because we're not interested in keeping their discussion going by telling them we disagree. It sucks.</code><br/><br/>Sure, I feel exactly that way about this discussion but because of all the people who have been posting against Jess and her concerns, I now have to join the discussion too. <br/><br/>If you don't like to be doing this and I don't like to be doing this, isn't there a way that we can stop this escalating and just talk about ideas without trying to drown each other out?<br/><br/>In case that never comes and I am mistaken for a silent and assenting paricipant, here's my courtesy post so that nobody assumes my consent:<br/><br/>I want a place where people who feel excluded can say they feel excluded and open up dialogues to try and make their communities better. I want a place where community counts. I want to engage in conversations and produce a body of work with people I can trust and respect. I don't understand how that is a bad thing. <br/><br/>Jess, I don't know you at all, but I have to say that I'm very impressed with your ability to stay voiced and reasonable in the face of so much backlash. You rock.                        </div>

                            Oops.  Darn.  Maybe I should actually answer Jess' questions.  Now there's a thought.  
<blockquote>1. Community: What is the role of Story Games as an internet community of gamers? Who belongs and what are they supposed to be talking about?</blockquote>
Well, it's pretty loose, as we can see.  "Story Games" isn't defined, but it does have a clear focus on Forge-related games.  So, say, we probably wouldn't be comfortable if a bunch of D&amp;D players came in and started making twenty D&amp;D mechanics threads a day.  
<blockquote>2. Language: What sort of language do we, as gamers on the internet talking about gaming, use? How does the language we use affect other people and encourage/discourage them from participating in gaming discussions?</blockquote>
Kind of a broad question there.  I use some jargon but try to minimize it.  Jargon inherently reduces the space of people who can meaningfully participate, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  Only a finite number of people can participate in a discussion, after all, and it's important to pick which.  Also, people in general respond to dialogue which they can relate to.  So, for example, I find it hard to participate on ENWorld even if they are making interesting points, because I don't have the common cultural base of frequent D&amp;D play.  
<blockquote>3. Gender: Roleplaying has a perceived history of being a male hobby. Does this influence the way we play, write, and talk about roleplaying games now?</blockquote>
Well, the short answer is yes.  I think the ways that it influences things are a little too long to be named, though.                        </div>

                            This is pretty simple.<br/>
<br/>
I think the 'macho' manifesto was appalling. I know exactly what "macho" means. You don't have to explain it. It means violence against women and children.  Trying to make it mean something else is nice if you need a hobby I guess, but that's like trying to make "ocean" not refer to "water", when you're talking to me.<br/>
<br/>
But fuck it, it's not my thread, nobody is forcing me to read it. (And I didn't post on it.)  So I don't. Now if by my silence people infer, oh, JDCorley is okay with that macho type language, that's their business, not mine. The Internet is a big place, there's always room for another thread.<br/>
<br/>
There's no need for me to click on it regularly and be shocked, shocked by the new developments. Nor is there any need for people to click on the gender-language threads and be shocked, shocked at what I or anyone else posts there. I often feel like I'm listening to Claude Rains in these discussions, being horrified to discover gambling is going on in Rick's, as he collects his winnings. "Oh no, someone on the Internet is being insensitive, or too sensitive, or something."                        </div>

<p>For a cheap laugh, meander back over the various responses here to Jess' question 1, then take the text from <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2005/12/strange-place.html" rel="nofollow" title="Deep in the Game:  A Strange Place">here</a> and replace the word "ball" with the word "post," and "game" with "forum."</p>
<p>(I hasten to add that play doesn't necessarily map to what we do here, so I am by no means convinced that the above is useful for anything <em>but</em> a cheap laugh. Myself, I'm sympathetic to both sides. Again: complex world.)</p>
