You then lose the extra APs if you take an extended rest.  My estimate (anyone with more experience able to back this up) is that a party is likely to only go 3-4 Encounters maaaayybbeeee 5-6 without an extended rest and almost never longer than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after 1 Encounter you'll have 1 AP, After 2 Encounters you'll have 2 AP.  After 4 Encounters you'll have 3 AP.  But since you're likely to need to rest after 4 Encounters, you'd best have been spending those AP right along...1 AP per encounter for 3 out of 4 encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, geeze.  That's a whole lot of fiddly tracking to come down to spending 1 AP per encounter 3 out 4 encounters.  Why not just make it 1 AP per encounter period.  No tracking, no saving, no losing, no reseting, no pissing with milestones.  Just flat out, you get 1 AP per encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, but there's some cool stuff you can do when you can spend more than 1 AP per encounter.  Further...it seems pretty clear that there was a rules change at some point because monsters get AP too, and the monster manual clearly refers to monsters spending multiple AP per encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point, here's an easy solution.  Spend 1 Healing Surge, gain 1 AP.  That gives you the option to spend multiple APs and puts a definite cost to it that makes for an interesting choice.  Further, it can soak up a few of those "excess" healing surges to ramp up the danger level with the benefit of the players having done it to themselves.  It also allows for those occasional interesting set ups of trying to rest for 8 straight hours (allowing for watches) camped in the middle of a hostile dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then you have the choice of what to use APs for.  Currently you either get an extra action, or activate a Paragon Power.  Here's some other thoughts that I like:<br/>\n* Spend 1 AP to reroll a d20 roll<br/>\n* Spend 1 AP to reroll a damage roll<br/>\n* Spend 1 AP to make an opponent reroll a d20 roll or a damage roll<br/>\n* Spend 1 AP to give yourself a +2 after seeing the roll (useful to avoid those whiffage situations...but still has a cost so as not to undermine Reliable powers)<br/>\n* Spend 1 AP to give someone else a +2 "Aid Another bonus"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150483/#Comment_150483" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T10:40:49+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 10:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to see someone do the reverse.

To be exact, I laugh at it derisively for being so lame.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, while it seems logical to add  more APs into the system to make it worthwhile, there is the substantial problem of front-load balance in the D&amp;D; combat system. By "front-load balance" I mean the fact that the most important turns in D&amp;D; combat are taken at the beginning: there are stabbery options for rogues, but then there's also the fact that at the beginning nobody's used their most powerful moves yet (and therefore those first turns will be their most effective ones before they're forced to turn to those at-will pings), and the fact that at the beginning you don't have to spend turns healing others (or yourself), and there's also the fact that somebody might not get their turn at all if they're unlucky and killed off before their turn comes around.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, D&amp;D; combats usually seem to last just a couple of rounds in this edition - at least our Shadowfell encounters last 3-4 rounds at most, and even then the outcome is already known to within one healing surge after the first two rounds at the latest. So that's why I'd be very careful in adding more Action Points into the system: the most efficient way to use action points is to burn them on the first round of combat (assuming that you manage to get into position to do it), so giving one to everybody at the beginning of combat effectively <i>doubles the significance of stealth and initiative</i>: you're not only dicing off to see who gets to hit first and perhaps a second time (with both surprise and superior initiative); you're actually finding out who gets to hit 2-3 times before the opponent gets a go - and if you not only give action points to everybody, but also give them more than one per encounter, then you could be giving the surprising, superior initiative group <i>four</i> actions before the opponent gets to act. And as I said, those poor kobolds are usually pretty much done already after two full rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is why I don't think that action points are very good for D&amp;D; as implemented - I haven't yet made up my mind over how they should be improved, but if I had to make my choice right now, I'd go for removing them altogether rather than trying to make them significant - tracking them is just annoying bullshit with minimal interesting features; certainly the stated purpose of rewarding characters for going several combats without rest is total bunk with no basis on resource math; you actually get more action points by resting after each encounter rather than fiddling with those milestones.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Now, there is one reason to keep the action points, and it's the fact that they're pretty much the only way to combat the obnoxious whiff factor. They fail at that as well as currently ruled, though, as they don't allow you to retry that once-a-day power that whiffed; the best you can do is to use some other power instead - and fail with that as well, presumably. Considering how the extra action is just about the worst thing you could add to a system that already features front-loaded combats, I'd say that the safe bet is to completely revamp what the action points do, if you're using them at all.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAn added problem I have with AP, in case it didn't already become clear, is the fact that they're mostly presented as a milestone reward mechanic (at which they fail, as I already said).  I don't care a lot of the whole AP thing this way or that, but I care intensely about what to do with the rest cycle in D&amp;D-style; adventure games - as it stands, the 4th edition fails spectacularly in providing any substantial improvements on the last editions in that regard. So when asked how to improve AP, I really have to ask - do you want to have a discretionary resource, or do you want to have a milestone reward? Ralph's list of suggestions goes a long way with the former, but doesn't touch upon the latter, to my mind much trickier, problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, Ralph's list of suggested replacement options for action points seems pretty valid. I'd remove the "extra action" option altogether and make the reroll option the primary one, at first blush; that'd be effective at combatting the front-loading, as it wouldn't make those first combat turns significantly more efficient like the extra action does. I'll have to think about it if I end up running the game again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150504/#Comment_150504" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T11:16:28+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 11:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I think I would ditch the "AP gives you an extra attack" thing entirely and just use it as a resource to power other things, like making things less whiffy and allowing players to inject creative elements into play.

It's situationally powerful, but doesn't outshine either the core use of APs (which is really, really powerful) or the new uses gained through paragon paths.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150518/#Comment_150518" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T11:37:56+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 11:37AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to use AP as the fuel for adding Beliefs.

Many monsters not only have multiple APs but the tactics text instructs GMs how to spend them (specifically the Terrasque instructs spending them all up front early in an Encounter and not saving them).  This seems to indicate that monsters at least can spend multiple APs per Encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this an example of a rule that got changed partway through and incompletely edited?

They're all "when do I do this" choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were going to house up some alternative AP rules, I'd want to shift the emphasis from the the fun "when do I do this" AP choice (because the game already has you making plenty of that kind of choice), to the also fun "which of these options do I do" choice (which the game doesn't have much of currently).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this would also be beneficial because of the 3 "when do I do this" choices above, the AP choice is the weakest by far.  The powers are much more situation relative (other than the At-Wills which are pretty much always "on").  Using an AP for an extra attack is a much less hard choice.  9 times in 10 the answer to "when do I do it" is "as soon as possible" which is typically on the very first turn where taking an extra action can put someone down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151188/#Comment_151188" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T10:21:03+00:00" title="June 17, 2008 10:21AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            but that's kind of born out over the fact you need two encounters to replenish.

My serious gripe with them so far is their lack of use out of combat. I would love to see a "i'm awesome" botton outside of combat. Something along the lines of pass this and the next check you make out of combat or something more like that. Quite frankly I think your right that theirs already lots to decide about in combat and i don't think giving the action point more actions in combat will fix/change that.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151190/#Comment_151190" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T10:35:45+00:00" title="June 17, 2008 10:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the thing about the AP replenish is that its really pretty weak sauce as a limiting factor.  Even if you go 6 whole encounters without resting, there's only 2 encounters where you'll have to choose to save your AP.  The other 4 you'll want to spend 1 (or you lose it) and you'll want to spend it early.  If you have a party with even 2 big bruiser types (like say a dwarven fighter and a Dragonborn Paladin) you can arrange it so one of you always has the AP to spend early.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you rest after 4 encounters, there's only 1 you'll have to skip spending an AP on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have 4 fights with 2 Skill Challenges (because it appears as though Skill Challenges are counted as "Encounters" for purposes of earning AP) you can spend 1 AP in every encounter (subject to the timing of the Skill Challenges, of course) without skipping any.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt comes so close to being 1 AP per encounter that the effort to track milestones and who spent what when just so you know which character doesn't have an AP option this time just seems like little bang for the buck.  Not zero bang...but as far as resource management goes...its pretty weak in the management department.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, AP for out of combat stuff, definitely.  Currently AP are useless in Skill Challenges.  Even if you allowed one to be spent for an extra skill roll, all that would do is give you yet another roll to fail.  But if AP gave you bonuses, or allowed rerolls or allowed you to give others bonuses...then there'd be another way to over come the harsh DC of Skill Challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact...if I were to REALLY reengineer the non XP/Treasure reward system I'd reward Skill Challenges with Healing Surges that benefit you when you're fighting and reward combat with Challenge Points that benefit you in Skill Challenges (kind of a non pornographic Barbaren mechanism).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151210/#Comment_151210" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T13:07:23+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  1:07PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2008 1:08PM by Clinton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>Ralph,<br><br>Have you played yet?</br></br></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151212/#Comment_151212" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T13:24:53+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  1:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just one session.  Not enough to see a full cycle of play, which is why this is all TBD and brainstorming and I haven't written up any "house rules".  Can't fix it till you can see what's broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut its pretty clear that the APs are something of a grafted on after thought.  I'd bet money that there was an earlier beta version in which they were more like "Hero Points" from other games...then the more Hero Pointy aspects got whittled away until there was little left, but instead of discarding them as unnecessary they were kept...either because someone had difficulty shooting the sacred cow, or because by that time too many powers keyed off of AP use and they didn't have the time to rework them all.  I'd bet money that there was a version where losing the accumulated APs when taking an extended rest HURT, cuz you can see from the text where its written from the point of view that losing those accumulated APs would be a big deal...then they were nerfed.  I suspect the "use one per encounter" rule was a late addition to the text because someone got cold feet, because the text in the monster manual is still largely based on what would appear to be an older version where you could spend as many as you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the above is based on my musings on the topic that a trackable game resource outta carry its own weight...meaning it outta have a big enough impact to justify its existance.  Right now I'm not seeing anything that couldn't have been handled much more simply and streamlined (allow once per encounter spending 1 Healing Surge for an extra action and be done with it...80% of the same effect 10% of the rules text).  Unfortuneatly there's a bunch of powers tied into APs so its too late to do that level of redesign without a lot of extra work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151230/#Comment_151230" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T14:51:56+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  2:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ralph,<br><br>Can you point out the MM text stuff?<br><br>I remember reading a lot of stuff from WOTC regarding lessons they've learned from M:tG, one of which, is that stuff that adds turns or removes them led to the most broken mechanics ever.

Perhaps monsters play by different rules...perhaps the Terrasque (being just about the nastiest monster ever) plays by its own rules...but barring those possibilities that would seem to reflect an earlier rules design where spending multiple APs was the norm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151234/#Comment_151234" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T15:18:09+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  3:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2008 3:19PM by Adam_Dray.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Page 6 of the Monster Manual:</cite><br><b>Action Points</b><br>Elite and solo monsters have action points they can use to take<br>extra actions, just as PCs do.

I wouldn't be surprised if a year or two down the line, we get more developed rules that exist to encourage players to go longer between extended rests.<br><br>(of course the old Tunnels &amp; Trolls rule was you got 100 xp per level of dungeon you went down at one go.

Its just not that big of deal.  Unless your GM is pounding you with difficult encounter after difficult encounter, or you're frivolously using them in easy encounters, there will never be a time when you don't have an AP to spend when the going gets tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you follow the DMG advice about mixxing up encounter difficulty (there's even a handy table), even modestly experienced should be able to identify the "easy" ones and not waste an AP on them.  Or if a player or two does use an AP on them (to bail themselves out of a mistake, or just cuz its cool) its unlikely you'll have a difficult encounter where nobody has any AP left.  Further, if you follow the DMG advice about mixxing in Skill Challenges (and currently AP don't help with Skill Challenges that I've seen) then you quite likely will be able to spend an AP in every encounter...even the easy ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt which point simply getting 1 AP per encounter is a way simpler rule to manage.<br/>\n<br/>\nTieing the rings to Milestones is one of those elements that makes it more difficult to house rule this, however.  One of the advantages to a simplified AP system is the ability to simply ignore Milestones as a fairly lame tabletop version of a video game "Check Point".  But if you do that you have to unwind them from all of the places they touch...even when the places they touch are kind of odd...I can't for the life of me figure out why rings are tied to Milestones the way they are...other then having gone through the trouble to invent Milestones, they needed something for them to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151241/#Comment_151241" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T16:34:03+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  4:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the feeling that the "spend them early and often" thing will change at higher levels, too.  I can see it being a much better option when you're fighting some high AC, high HP monstrosity to wait for it to be knocked prone, grabbed, blinded or whatever, get an "until the end of my next turn" buff from the leader, and then everyone spends their action points to wail (whale?) on it while it's granting combat advantage, losing AC, or whatever else.  You might be able to do that in the first round (and it's certainly advantageous to do so) but the chance of missing with the grab or trip or whatever, and the Leader's need to hit something to use most of their buffs means that you might need to wait a couple of rounds to get the right situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
