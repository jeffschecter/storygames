Mythender is a game about heroes who venture into Mythic Norden and kill powerful heathen monsters in the name of the Lord. Since this was a playtest, I'm going to put in some observations on the mechanics later on. Ryan has called the game a Beast Hunters heartbreaker, but it's really it's very own beast at this point, if you pardon the pun.<br/><br/>But first the cast. Each player creates an epic hero through several steps in her or his life, which create traits, special moves, and the likes. Then, in one of my favorite pieces of the game, the character's player sets out a seed for the character's "Hero Glow." That glow includes all the effects around the character that show mortals that they're facing a legend. Now everyone around the table adds to that seed, with the character's player having veto rights.<br/><br/>My character was a huge Germanic warrior who carried a millstone on his back and dragged a cart full of defeated enemies' bones around with him. He'd use the millstone to sharpen the bones. It turns out that stabby bones come in handy for scaling gigantic creatures in a Shadow of Colossus/God of War sort of way as well. His greatest weapons were an indomitable will, raw intimidation, and an ego bigger than the Dragon itself. Now that I wrote that, I realize that he's a lot like a savage version of Kratos. Part of his glow was that people's hearts start racing wildly when he nears, and thanks to Joe, whenever he loves someone, their heart actually explodes. As if my character needed more reasons to be mean and uncaring <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'll let the other players talk about their characters, but just in short: we had Joe's violinist so gifted that his songs could end lives and myths; Brendan's sole survivor of the Children's Crusade who never aged and was hailed (by us players) as the Second Coming of Christ; and Jackson's Scandinavian hero who trapped a fairy into his sword and forced her to sing magical songs during battle while he killed mountains. Thanks to our combined Hero Glow effects, whereever we go, rivers run clear (and then freeze), people cry, mountains shy away, sparks fly, birds of darkness circle, metals sing, and so on.<br/><br/>We ended up fighting a huge serpent Dragon and the Earth Itself. They never stood a chance. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Here's how fighting works. The basic action allows you to roll a trait's rating in "storm dice." Storm dice are fleeting; you just roll them to see whether they give you successes this round (4+ on a D6). Any success nets you a "thunder die."<br/><br/>You also start with one thunder die, and roll all that you have during your action alongside your storm dice. Any success on those nets you a "lightning token." So, <b>storm dice -&gt; thunder dice -&gt; lightning tokens</b>. However, thunder dice stick around after the roll (unlike storm dice). That's important because thunder dice also represent your "hit points" - when you run out of those, through taking damage, you've got to spend your most valuable resource (mythic energy) or be out of the conflict.<br/><br/>And finally, you can spend lightning tokens to create a condition (i.e., Scene Aspect), hinder an enemy, or straight out inflict damage. When you do damage, the victim rolls to see how many thunder dice she loses. So you're taking away effectiveness at the same time that you're bringing them closer to defeat. Each consecutive time you hurt someone, they're more likely to lose dice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147828/#Comment_147828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T20:49:23+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  8:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me first say that the fight was great fun. Rolling the dice and reading the results becomes intuitive after just a round or two. There are some added options, like Grandstanding, where you don't get to roll storm dice but all your thunder dice net you two lightning tokens per success (and failed ones are discarded), and you can bring in special moves and relics with various powers. Our descriptions were quite over the top, in a good sort of way. The Second Coming of Christ struck out with the light and judgment of God (and a hammer). The violinist was baked into a husk of earth, died, came back to life, and burst out with a vengeance. Jackson kept pummeling the poor Dragon with Death From Above and slit open its face, and my character used that opportunity to tear out half its jawbone and bash its head in with it.<br/><br/>The main thing I noticed about the rules is that your narration has no impact on your effectiveness, but it can impact the kind of effect you cause. So you want to cover your bases with your descriptions, but there's no mechanical need to make them especially creative, awesome, or tactical. The reason we did that anyway lies in part in the character creation: we made these total badass characters, and we'll be damned if they don't show off during a battle. The other part is that we as a group supported it with the typical social rewards of yelling, laughing, and applauding. So there obviously are various ways to promote that kind of input. This makes it fundamentally different from Beast Hunters; at the same time, there are many more tactical options to allow Stepping Up on the mechanical level.<br/><br/>While players cannot combine actions, they can hand each other lightning tokens, and they get a bonus token if they pass on 3 or more. That's crucial, I think, to making this work as a group game, along with creating conditions for each other to use. Initially I was wishing for more ability to work together, but conditions are probably flexible enough in the long run to simluate various sorts of group maneuvers. You might just want to think about a third level of condition (or maybe one that lowers damage costs to 5 against a particular enemy or something) to broaden that existing mechanic a bit.<br/><br/>The one thing I suggested right after the game was that you might want to require myths to use all of their traits once before they use one a second time. That's because they're rated higher and lower, but contrary to PCs (who gain mythic power from using each trait once), there's no incentive to use the lower-rated ones. You might say that a GM would do that anyway for flavor, but in an outright players-vs-GM game like this, if I was the GM, I would like to be able to play to the fullest without being tempted to go with lower traits to give players a break. It would be easier for me as a GM to cycle through all of them rather than having to consider whether to be harder or softer on the players through my use of traits with higher or lower ratings.<br/><br/>Oh, here's a thought: if you did this, hinderance could allow characters to check off any trait of an enemy, so that the enemy has to use the lower-rated ones all over again before getting back to the higher one. In the fiction, you'd temporarily block the Dragon's breath or whatnot.<br/><br/>We didn't get a chance to play our characters outside of a conflict. And I'm not sure we'd do much of that anyway. The fun in Mythender is in epic battles between legends of different worlds, and I wouldn't mind focusing on that. Still, it might need some longer-running playtesting to see how that plays out. It does have several things to support longer games, including the gaining and improving of special moves and relics and the mortality track.<br/><br/>Ryan, I think this thing is pretty damn solid right now. Thanks for running it, and I'm looking forward to seeing it all polished and dressed up <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147831/#Comment_147831" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T21:08:20+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  9:08PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dammit, Ryan, I demand you come to Miami Beach right now and run this for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147867/#Comment_147867" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T00:10:25+00:00" title="June  4, 2008 12:10AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2008 12:18AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you so much, Christian.  Poke me if I don't do up an Anima Prime one by tomorrow.<br/><br/>So, the really fucking cool that about running two playtests at a con is the ability to rewrite elements based on one and immediately try it again -- "playstorming" I believe is the term.  Here's what I changed for the Sunday morning game:\n<blockquote>The one thing I suggested right after the game was that you might want to require myths to use all of their traits once before they use one a second time. That's because they're rated higher and lower, but contrary to PCs (who gain mythic power from using each trait once), there's no incentive to use the lower-rated ones.</blockquote>\nRight.  I used it because it's cool to change up your stuff, but yeah, GMs need a reason to not just hit hard every time.  Well, there's a rule that I don't think I stated (or needed to state) which needs a better title, but it's currently the "Rule of Not Repeating Shit."  If you do something that's essentially the same as a previous panel, with no attempt to vary, then the other side as already seen it coming, and you lose one success in both pools.  This goes equally for everyone, so the GM is encouraged to keep things different.  (Which does mean there is a little bit where your narration affects the immediate mechanics rather than future mechanical choices, but not much -- which I like.  I'm a fan of a lighter hand in that department, I've found.)<br/><br/>But I don't want Myths to regenerate Mythic Power like the Mythenders can.  So, for Sunday morning, I made a "check off all the traits, and when it's cashed in, the Myth rolls looking for 3+ on the dice instead of 4+ for that roll."  We'll see how that works, but it seemed to work well then.\n<blockquote>Oh, here's a thought: if you did this, hinderance could allow characters to check off any trait of an enemy, so that the enemy has to use the lower-rated ones all over again before getting back to the higher one. In the fiction, you'd temporarily block the Dragon's breath or whatnot.</blockquote>\nI'll have to try that.  But given how uninteresting Hindrances were, here's what I changed:  You don't raise their success TN on the dice, you actually <i>hinder</i> someone's ability to use a Mythic Power-using Battle Ability.  Remember how the Dragon kept spending MP to take an extra turn, interrupting you guys?  How would you like to stop that?<br/><br/>This ended up solving the game's biggest problem: unless the GM handwaves something (which I did in the Saturday night game, as an attempt to implement a rule idea), the battle surges on until the Myth is out of Mythic Power.  But it's a beat-fest, totally tyranny of the victor, once its Thunder dice are reduces and it can't generate Lightning to do anything worth a damn, but isn't dead.  Since "Not Dying" is a Mythic Power-using Battle Ability, it finally gave me a way to hand the players the Myth's own doom.  It worked well Sunday morning.<br/><br/>And what's slotted to be changed:\n<blockquote>While players cannot combine actions, they can hand each other lightning tokens, and they get a bonus token if they pass on 3 or more. That's crucial, I think, to making this work as a group game, along with creating conditions for each other to use. Initially I was wishing for more ability to work together, but conditions are probably flexible enough in the long run to simluate various sorts of group maneuvers. You might just want to think about a third level of condition (or maybe one that lowers damage costs to 5 against a particular enemy or something) to broaden that existing mechanic a bit.</blockquote>\nThe Sunday morning group also asked for more ways to work together.  That's high on the list, though as I spoke with Albert, finding places where working together is mechanically interesting.  The lightning share bit came from the first time that was asked for.<br/><br/>[continued...]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147868/#Comment_147868" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T00:10:38+00:00" title="June  4, 2008 12:10AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2008 1:07PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the thing is that, with the new Hindrance rules, you needed to be able to buy off a Hindrance.  The side doing the hindering spent a minimum of 2 Lightning to hinder something, and the total spent indicates how much the other side has to spend to get it back.  I ruled off the cuff when asked that someone else could spend that cost +1 to unhinder someone else, like helping a friend out.  Later, Ogre said it should be the reverse: helping someone should be cheaper than helping yourself.  I'm totally implementing that.<br/><br/>And, after talking with Albert, I'm looking at Damage also providing an additional effect: a single use, 1-Storm Circumstance that is only usable by the next friendly person.  That way, there's more interactivity going on.\n<blockquote>Then, in one of my favorite pieces of the game, the character's player sets out a seed for the character's "Hero Glow."</blockquote>\nHoly crap, what you guys did for your Mantles were fucking awesome.  On Sunday morning, I remarked that I wouldn't be surprised if, since I'm so hardcore framing this game as a comic book game, someone actually took something like "My font is red, dripping with blood, whenever I speak" as a Mantle.  Ogre did, which his speech always in 24-point calligraphic font (if I recall right).  In any case, those two games snapped something in my mind:  Mantles should be a part of the narration.  I mean, you guys were totally using it, but I think that if you could get an extra Storm die for working in a Mantle (I think a limit of two: one for a Personal Mantle, and one for a Relic's Mantle), that could rock.<br/><br/>Which means, yeah, Relics will have Mantles, too.  Even Christian ones, because, fuck it, Ogre's right -- they should look awesome in the comic.  Though, it would be thematically-appropriate if they weren't pagan-y gonzo.  But who am I to say that your Christian Relic can't have the Mantle "The sword sings magical songs of a trapped fairy who laments her inevitable doom"?<br/><br/>Also, based on what I saw in the game with Grandstanding, I'm making it so that the Mortality dice causes Mortality loss/Quadruple Lightning on a 4-6, not just a 6.\n<blockquote>We didn't get a chance to play our characters outside of a conflict. And I'm not sure we'd do much of that anyway. The fun in Mythender is in epic battles between legends of different worlds, and I wouldn't mind focusing on that. Still, it might need some longer-running playtesting to see how that plays out. It does have several things to support longer games, including the gaining and improving of special moves and relics and the mortality track.</blockquote>\nNancy was in my Sunday morning game, and she was the first person to have a "level 3" Mythender.  It showed that I need to work on advancement &amp; Mortality.  The point of the advancement is that, at the end of a campaign (say, five battles), you should beat the living hell of our Thor -- which, being a pagan God, has a whole new level of shit to bring to the table.  (Pagan God Grandstanding: roll Thunder dice, total the pips rather than looking for successes, and that's how much Lightning it generates.)<br/><br/>Also, while the playtests convinced me that I don't need to make all sorts of separate sub-systems for dealing with the town and perilous journey and all that (the whole "seriously, this is a badass comic book" bit finally hit this weekend), I think I could use making advice text on how to have an "exposition spread or issue" (again, with the comic terminology).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147882/#Comment_147882" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T00:48:14+00:00" title="June  4, 2008 12:48AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2008 12:48AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h3>Mythender Characters from Saturday Night</h3><b>Christian as Korek</b><br/><br/>Name: Korek<br/>Ambition: I will be the most remembered<br/><br/>Traits [Rating]:<br/>- I am terror [3] (Minion Trait)<br/>- I have slain my entire tribe [1]<br/>- I am known ever my the myths [2]<br/>- I am a wrestler of myths [3]<br/>- I am the bringer of winter [2] (Supernatural)<br/><br/>Convictions:<br/>- I must break their courage<br/>- I must kill heather priests<br/><br/>Signature Moves [Rating/Uses]:<br/>- I tear open their jugular [3/1]<br/>- Ripping out their bones [2/1]<br/><br/>Personal Mantle:<br/>- Hearts race and, if I love them, explode<br/>- Bones ache to be torn out by me<br/>- Birds of darkness circle around me<br/>- Rivers freeze over<br/><br/>Mortality: 2 out of 15 lost (due to Supernatural Trait rating)<br/>Battle Damage: [3] [3] [4] [5]<br/><br/>First Relic: Sophia's Cross<br/>Origin: Christian / Level: 3<br/>Description: Silver, tiny, bright<br/>Battle Effect: [Reaction] Ignore rolling when damaged, cost: 2 Mythic Power<br/><br/>Second Relic: Giant Dragonbone Sword<br/>Origin: Pagan / Level: 1<br/>The rest of it wasn't fleshed out<br/><hr/><b>Brendan as Mariette</b><br/><br/>Name: Mariette<br/>Ambition: I will bring about the second coming<br/><br/>Traits [Rating]:<br/>- I am the first from the brow of the son of Man.

Vasili speaks to him without moving, his voice eminating from the land, and then stands-and-grabs-the-boys-leg in one motion, suspending him upside down. the boy reveals that he isn't operating on someone else's behalf, he just hates powerful people coming into and disrespecting his villiage. in the dream, vasili is about to kill the boy whom upon closer inspection is a girl, then decides against it. he marks her forhead with his name and tells her that he shall return for her in a dozen years or so, then tosses her into the snow. there are many other harsh words exchanged. (to be clear, i see this as a frank miller-esque sort of comic character, with all the pointless sexism and violence that accompanies. i imagine that there are uncomfortable sexually-charged moments with this captive child which feed the anti-hero vision i have for Vasili.) after vasili exits, the girl says something that insinuates that she'll be training her ass off for the next twelve years and be ready for him when he returns, He, this mythical man who has come to her villiage. and a new MythEnder is born!<br/><br/>so, i think it would be fun if each ME had an opportunity to evidence themselves to the other players, though NOT the other mythenders. this game is like <b>Perfect</b> insomuch as i think it works better with minimal character-to-character interaction. like, brendan's character and my character would have hated each other. actually, the only two whom i could see working together and liking each other were brendan's and joe's. though christian and i were both barbaric (total games that weekend i played feat. christian barbarians: 2/6) we'd still try to rip out each other's throats. so let's not.<br/><br/>yeah, so it would be cool to have a scene with the mythenders arriving in a town, and what some of the townfolk reactions are. this could give the GM a chance to set up what the town is like, and then the players can maybe throw in details too. this is also a great inspiration for the players for their own scenes.<br/>then we'd have a series of short scenes like the one above, mostly monologing with other players tossing stuff in... or it might be nice just to sit back and watch what other folks have made up. this is just to see who these monsters are a little, showing how totally hardcore they are by standing them rightr next to simple, normal folks just trying to get by in mythic norden.<br/>then there'd be a scene with the MEs leaving, and the villiage behind them, maybe the GM could provide snippits of conversation that the players as audience (or the reader of the comic book) would be privvy to, normal people talking about the legends they've just interacted with. i mean, maybe there would be pillars of smoke from the buildings that had been set ablaze (i've got to protect people fron the cold, right?), just showing the changes that the MEs had enacted upon the townsfolk's lives.<br/><br/>to me, that would crank the awesome. so to speak.<br/>i would like there to be some little mechanical thing too, maybe one of three or five options that a player could seek to get from a scene. then we could pull a feather from bliss stage's cap and have the other players who watched the scene decide what they saw and the player gets that bonus. <br/>or whatever. the other player's judgement thing isn't really neccesary. <br/><br/>more later, "breakfast" time.

The fate of many mythenders is to become myth, and to be themselves ended by their friends or by the next group of mythenders to come by.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>so, i think it would be fun if each ME had an opportunity to evidence themselves to the other players, though NOT the other mythenders. this game is like<b>Perfect</b>insomuch as i think it works better with minimal character-to-character interaction. like, brendan's character and my character would have hated each other. actually, the only two whom i could see working together and liking each other were brendan's and joe's. though christian and i were both barbaric (total games that weekend i played feat. christian barbarians: 2/6) we'd still try to rip out each other's throats. so let's not.<br/><br/>yeah, so it would be cool to have a scene with the mythenders arriving in a town, and what some of the townfolk reactions are. this could give the GM a chance to set up what the town is like, and then the players can maybe throw in details too. this is also a great inspiration for the players for their own scenes.<br/>then we'd have a series of short scenes like the one above, mostly monologing with other players tossing stuff in... or it might be nice just to sit back and watch what other folks have made up. this is just to see who these monsters are a little, showing how totally hardcore they are by standing them rightr next to simple, normal folks just trying to get by in mythic norden.<br/>then there'd be a scene with the MEs leaving, and the villiage behind them, maybe the GM could provide snippits of conversation that the players as audience (or the reader of the comic book) would be privvy to, normal people talking about the legends they've just interacted with. i mean, maybe there would be pillars of smoke from the buildings that had been set ablaze (i've got to protect people fron the cold, right?), just showing the changes that the MEs had enacted upon the townsfolk's lives.</blockquote>\nI think there's a dial here.  Some folks will make mythenders who should totally be in each others scenes -- like, maybe a party of Templars who decide to quell some mythic ass.  To keep with the comic book terminology, I'm looking to call them "exposition issues," where it's just about character interaction.  You get a page or two (what we'd call a "scene") to play out a scene in a town.  In each scene, you decide beforehand if it's involving a Trait to worth up mythic power, or if it's about being humble &amp; mortal to regain Mortality.  After playing at GPNW, I'm leaning towards something in the vein of PTA for these scenes, though without conflict rules.<br/><br/>I do love the idea of a page as the Mythenders leave, showing the aftermath of their encounter.  I think that'll really sell the impact of the Mythenders coming into these people's lives.  Actually, thinking about it, bookending that -- having one also beforehand which shows these lives before the Mythenders come in the picture -- could also be potent.  But these wouldn't be systemic, necessary elements, just techniques that might be used by some folks, and might by used on occasion -- not every comic focuses on the NPCs of the world so much.<br/><br/>I think I've also seen how to do a "perilous journey" spread -- have the players go around a round or two in battle before the Myth shows up.  That'll have a different feel that "suddenly myth here!"  Again, not for use all the time, but a neat way to change things up and make different issues feel unique in a campaign (which needs its own comic term).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148875/#Comment_148875" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T14:50:55+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  2:50PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah, i like that idea about the mythic journey.<br/><br/>heh, that might just give us a huge helping of thunder dice by the time the baddie shows its face, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148950/#Comment_148950" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T00:23:22+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True.
