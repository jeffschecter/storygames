I've commented on our experience at the latest episode of <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a>.  I enjoyed the game and I'm glad to have played but, having my curiosity sated, I'm in no rush to pick up playing again--except maybe to get better at the tactics in the game.  We definitely had fun--more than some games, less than others--but it didn't 'feel' like D&amp;D.  I'm sure it's a perfectly good game--perhaps even 'the' game for fantasy miniatures combat, which I enjoy in measured doses.  The trick will be to link the battles with the interests and goals of the characters, which is the key in any game.    <br/>Mel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149006/#Comment_149006" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T10:07:20+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 10:07AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, Mel. We're about to jump in to our D&amp;D4 campaign, and I want to get on the same page with the other players about how to tie the battles into the story and especially what "play D&amp;D" means to them. I've been reading the books like a good Story Gamer trying to internalize what D&amp;D play is supposed to be but I realize that the D&amp;D veterans in my group may have preconceptions of what "D&amp;D" is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149075/#Comment_149075" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T13:48:00+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  1:48PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 1:48PM by M Eryesen.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wondering what you mean by "didn't 'feel' like D&amp;D."  Which previous version(s) of D&amp;D did it not feel like?  Which have you played?  I'm seeing tons of old school gamers who have played a lot of pre-red box, BECMI, 1st &amp; 2nd edition who are finding it really does scratch their D&amp;D itch.  I'm also seeing a  lot of people who have spent a lot of time with 3rd who say it doesn't "feel like D&amp;D."

There are two aspects.  First, 4E is a brand new game so of course it's going to be different--different rules, different mechanics, different races.  It's very likely if the game wasn't called D&amp;D I'd be wishing that D&amp;D had been like 4E at the start.  The second aspect, though, is really what I was getting at and that is that I'm not feeling the sense of wonderment and 'fantastic' that I felt when I first started playing AD&amp;D and that I can recognize in Tony's thread on playing with his son.  That's the feeling I was hoping for--expecting, maybe--and so I'm a little disappointed that, from the introductory adventure only, I wasn't feeling it.  It's not really the rules I don't think.  I can see 4E playing a lot like AD&amp;D--emphasis on the combat (at least the way I played it in high school), where the combats were important to the story and everything in between combat (or other conflicts) was achieved through roleplaying.  One more point--since the character I most associate with AD&amp;D was a wizard who was required to memorize spells in advance and adapt those spells to unexpected situations, all the while hoarding those spells for when they were really needed, I can't 'see' that wizard in 4E terms even though, as I mention on the podcast, I always wanted to somehow enable him to cast Magic Missile every round!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
