Now I'm up for talking about the craft of actually making it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically:  There's two types of scene-fragments that both <i>start out</i> looking very similar ... but which actually seem (to me) to have wildly opposite intents.  In both cases, character A (we'll call him Abe) is coasting along when something comes out and smacks him in the face with trouble or sadness or difficulty of some kind.  His happiness and freedom are threatened.  If something isn't done, his life is about to get much worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOW ... on the one hand this might be a adversity.  The intent might be to set Abe up to try to overcome this conflict and change himself and his situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut on the other hand, it might be suffering.  The intent might be to establish that Abe is a person who has bad stuff happen to him, and that there's nothing within his power to be done about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorta important to know which you're aiming for:  Adversity <i>absolutely requires</i> that Abe have the power to fight back against his circumstances.  Suffering <i>absolutely requires</i> that he not.  If two people are trying to play out a scene with Abe, and they don't agree on whether it's adversity or suffering they will butt heads, sure as anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, adversity is a well understood value in games.  We're all used to doing it ... indeed, there's a pretty well understood formula for how it goes:  Stakes, conflict, resolution, outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order for suffering scenes to get any traction, do they need to be equally well understood?  Is it possible to get on the same page of "This is suffering, not adversity" if we understand how to do adversity but don't understand how to do suffering?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway ... a first draft of a formula:<br/>\n(1) Character's bad circumstances are shown (e.g. "Keichi has no money")<br/>\n(2) Some external pressure acts to make those circumstances <b><i>immediate</i></b> (e.g. "Keichi goes to buy ice cream for Belldandy ... but has no money")<br/>\n(3) The external pressure is relieved (e.g. "Belldandy has money from her day-job, and offers to buy the ice cream instead")<br/>\n(4) The circumstances are expressed again, at more intense pitch (e.g. "Keichi knows that without money he is not a man ... he cannot even buy ice cream for his girlfriend!")<br/>\n<br/>\nSound right?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104301/#Comment_104301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T07:53:25+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  7:53AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are plenty of 'one damn thing after another' films and books where the source of suffering is not even overtly resolved (as in your formula). The formula is just "shit happens" and that's that. Existing games have done this with bad luck mechanics (or Bad Stuff in Amber, a slightly different but similar concept - Good Stuff characters still have adversity, Bad Stuff characters suffer.)<br><br>Not that your formula there is a bad one, it's very good actually. Having a plan to relieve the immediate cause of the situation but in a hollow way that the suffering is relieved too, that's a great idea. One thing that leaps out at me is that there has to be some flag for everyone involved that this is suffering and not adversity.  If I am thinking "man, how are we gonna have ice cream on this date" and then "yes! She paid! Score!" then we are not on the same page.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104302/#Comment_104302" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T07:54:56+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  7:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to ask whether the victim has to know if he has the power to fight back.

I think that the <i>player</i> needs to know (or at least explicitly learn) that they don't have the power to fight back.  <br><br>The obvious benefit of this is that they don't get all emotionally invested in winning a conflict that they're foredestined to lose.

Both the character and the player believe the bad stuff is avoidable.<br/><br/>The AP example I give is of state 2 - which resulted in a very odd feeling in me of alternating between a sense of empowerment and a sense of disempowerment during play.

So, you can say "Fine, I'm stabbed in the eye, I'm now Mutilated and I get tokens to help me in my next fight.  By the way, you're a bastard."  Note: You can also say "Some bastard stabs me in the eye. Tokens please!" But when someone else is doing it to you, you can say "Hell no, I don't want to lose an eye, I'm fighting back!"  The results of the fight might be mutilation, death, injury, whatever to you or the other guy.  The choice to fight or not could be anything, whether your character believes he can win, whether you do (your fighting ability might be crap), or whatever.<br/><br/>But, looking at your draft, that's still probably Stage 1, "Bloodbeard is pissed that he's been mutilated."  You can either make the choice to suffer stage 1 suffering and get a mechanical reward, or try and overcome the adversity and possibly have worse happen for no mechanical reward.<br/><br/>To take a non-game example track which I think matches John's question: What if the player can choose between suffering and adversity?  What if you can choose whether or not your character has the power to overcome it, does that make is suffering instead of adversity?<br/><br/>And a question of my own: does having the power to solve the suffering have to negate the suffering?<br/><br/>Like this:<br/>1. The problem: Keichi has no money.<br/>2. Immediate: Belldandy wants him to buy her some ice cream.<br/>3. Relieving the immediacy: Keichi get a loan from the local Yakuza and buy ice cream with it.<br/>4. Reinforce the hurt: Keichi was able to buy ice cream, but now he's in debt over his head.<br/><br/>Or perhaps even something less obvious:<br/>3. Relieving the immediacy: Keichi gets a job as a law clerk so he can afford gifts for his girlfriend, and buys her ice cream first thing.<br/>4. Reinforce the hurt: Keichi's boss is a huge jerk and he hates his job, and now has no free time to spend with his girlfriend or pursue his own dreams, like race car driving. But if he quits, he has no money and is back to square 1.<br/><br/>Couldn't you still focus on suffering even when you have the power to overcome the immediate problems?  Couldn't this be more about "right sizing" the conflict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104420/#Comment_104420" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T15:56:02+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  3:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>(2) make the problem immediate (e.g. Your character's house is burned down by elf-haters)<br/>(3) relieve that immediacy (Maggie the smith offers to let you stay in her attic until you find a new place)<br/>(4) reinforce the hurt (Maggie's fiance breaks off their engagement, now that he's discovered that she's an elf-lover)</blockquote>\nWell, thinking back on that campaign, there were cases where step 3 was handled by me, the player. That is, I'd come up with a "solution" to the immediate problem. To put in terms of your example, I'd come up with the existence of maggie the smith and call in the favor. The GM would then fiat that my clever idea automatically failed, or disastrously failed , or at most worked with disastrous side effects(step 4). It's linked to the idea that CHARACTER thought there was a solution to the problem, even thought the GM was hell-bent on foiling any solutions. <br/><br/>However, I could only keep up the in-character belief in her own efficacy for so long. After her actions had led to a sufficient amount of misery to the people she cared about, I couldn't help but play her as very cautious and "turtled." In response, the GM changed the consequences of one of her disastrous choices from total cluster$%#$ disaster to remarkable success, restoring some of her confidence. Which he then resumed whittling away again...<br/><br/>(Note, this would probably be described as GM asshattery of the worst kind by alot of people, including myself between sessions, but a) I didn't mind while actually playing because I could firewall off the railroading and b) I bet it would of worked better if I'd been in on the project, giving suggestions on how to hurt the character between sessions. In fact, in retrospect, I did a little of that, or at least I said "if you do x, you'll really torment the character" and we did talk quite a bit about what was going on)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104423/#Comment_104423" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T16:10:41+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  4:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            actually, come to think of it, I think I've implemented versions of your 4-point-misery program in Polaris games as the mistaken before.

I was answering about the story-structure of a character who has that sort of ability, and how it's different from the story of a character who doesn't.<br/><br/>The question of the player, and whether a character has the power to escape them (which, of course, no character ever does) strikes me as a totally different thing.<br/><br/>If you still think I'm conflating player and character, can you explain more precisely where you think that's happening?

Here's my thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\nA <i>character</i> who can choose between rising to adversity and giving up cannot thereby choose to be in a story of helpless suffering.  They're not helpless, and they can't un-narrate their power by just not taking advantage of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA <i>player</i> who can choose between giving their character the power to rise to adversity and giving them no hope at all can thereby choose to author a story of helpless suffering.  The character is genuinely helpless, because the player makes them that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think I've ever seen an example of actual play where people <i>explicitly</i> made that choice for a scene (although I've seen plenty of conflicts-turned-consensus:  "But ... you want my character to lose, and I want her to lose too ... do we have a conflict here at all?")

That's key.<br><br>With <i>Poison'd</i>, you sometimes make your character genuinely helpless, explicitly, because it's a part of the mechanics. When someone is helpless you can do certain things that you can't do otherwise. So it's a lure, kinda. "Look! James is helpless. He turned his back in defiance and can't stop you. Ebenezer is awfully good at hurting helpless people.

I don't know how I, personally, would deal with making the choice <i>after</i> the nature of the hardship was already on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's sort of like ... hrm.  How do I say this?  Okay, actual play from our recent Frostvar game (a little bit back in time, before issues got simplified):<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm playing Roland, who loves his fiance Skuld and hates his brother Sebastian.  Skuld loves Sebastian, who does not love her in turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a scene with Sebastian about whether he will be allowed access to Skuld, that <i>has to be Adversity</i>, by the nature of the situation.  Roland has power in that arena, whether he chooses to use it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a scene with Skuld about whether she will be allowed access to Sebastian, that <i>has to be Suffering</i>, by the nature of the situation.  Roland has no power to deny her.  It's not in him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, if you said "Let's have a scene about whether Sebastian and Skuld get to meet" then I can choose between adversity and suffering if I get to say whether the scene is with Sebastian or Skuld.  But if you said "Let's have a scene with Skuld about whether she can see Sebastian" then those stakes are already sufficiently detailed that they give me no wiggle room.  I could decide to have Roland <i>fight</i> with Skuld over this, but I would never, ever, not in a million years want there to be any chance that he might <i>win</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the outside, the "I stab you in the face" gives me the vibe of something with enough detail that it would be a very constrained decision.  What did it feel like from the inside?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104468/#Comment_104468" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T21:49:19+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  9:49PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2007 9:51PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've decided how Roland would deal with either situation, and if you had done that in the moment in play... awesome.<br><br>"Skald leaves to go see Sebastian.

It's wired into the guy ... it's a set of constraints I've chosen to play under.

Were you one of the people being discriminated against, or was the character looking at the problem from the outside?<br/><br/>Half-elven baronness, the richest and highest socially ranked half-elf in the nation.   (Elves were Arrest-on-Sight, and had been for a generation. The change had been now the xenophobes were turning their attention to oppressing half-elves as well.) To some degree it was a combination though of being direct victim and on the outside. It was much worse for working-class half-elves, and a fair amount of the action was of the form "what are you willing to risk to alleviate the suffering of your fellow half-elves" although actually saving the half-elves was completely off the table as an option or possibility, and whatever she tried to do tended to end in disaster. (Another example - we rescued a half-elf who was severely wounded and in danger of losing his arm. We took him to a sorceress to heal his arm. He was later recaptured, and the human fanatics noticed that his arm was healed with magic. So they cut off his arm in order to restore the natural course of things.) Also the threat to her ramped up over the course of the campaign, from vague "these anti-half-elf actions portend eventual disaster for you" to "better not go out alone at night lest you get raped and killed by human vigilantes" to "better not go out at all, unless disguised" to "unstoppable magic ninja assassins with strong political ties kidnap your boyfriend and try to kill you" to "flee the country or die"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
