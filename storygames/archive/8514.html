Heart in mouth time here as I post some more detailed stuff about it for you all. First some background, then a link to a full description of play, so if you're not interested I'm not littering your screen with game spam. Its all on the Collective Endeavour site if you already read that, and that's where the links will take you.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic premise is that you play a star that has fallen to earth due to your fascination with mortal concerns. When you fell, you lost your starlight and your memory. Recently something triggered the awareness of what you were and a longing to go home, but you are held to earth by your lack of star stuff and ties that you have developed (either as a result of your fall or made during your "blank" period). You are now searching to find your starlight and return home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope it would appeal to people looking for something a little whimsical, with a lot of freedom (you can go anywhere in history in your search, but it could be a fantasy, sci-fi or horror setting if that's what you prefer), who like Neil Gaiman, Steven Moffat, Hayao Miyazaki and Guillermo del Toro (to name but a few). You can run it with a GM, or go for a really co-operative story-telling set up.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst play test description is here: http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1576                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lynne%20H" title="Lynne H"><img alt="Lynne H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lynne%20H">Lynne H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188949/#Comment_188949" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T00:19:10+00:00" title="January 19, 2009 12:19AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of these days I'll work out where I'm supposed to post stuff ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll go and stick it over there too...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
