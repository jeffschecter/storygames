We don't want to waste a bunch of time with you being indecisive about who your gonna be.  <br/><br/>We live in a city floating in the ocean. It is made up of many,  many boats, and other sea worthy devices tied together.(the size of New York City)  All the fish in the ocean are dead so food is somewhat hard to come by, though salt is almost a form of currency. Several years ago there was a bright flash of light.   Since then the shores have been glass, (HOLY SHIT MAN, THE FLASH MELTED THE SAND INTO GLASS) and mostly unapproachable aside from the random island here and there.  <br/><br/>Think Kevin Costner meets China Mieville. <br/><br/>Some bitch who shot me in the knee controls the city, with her tough gang of like minded biker bitches.(I think minus the bikes, but I bet they have canoes) I didn't vote for them because she shot me in the knee.  Miles is jesus, but girl Jesus, plus two weird points.  Tori is kind of a con artist of sorts, following Miles around and saving his her from burning boats.  They are both under twenty years old. <br/><br/>I'm older and was alive during the flash which makes me kind of a wise man so heed my advice.  I'm like Plato meets Rambo, but without the speech impediment and throw in some burns and scars. <br/><br/>I have my own boat with which I kicked the fighting shit out of a giant submarine.  Then Miles negotiated some form of peace with the subs captain, bringing it back to our city.  Then the bitch that shot me in the knee shot their captain in the head.  I wasn't happy about this.  The sub still has a crew though, so one of you might want to be one of them. <br/><br/>James is GM, so any thing can happen.  Think crazy."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338320/#Comment_338320" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T16:55:03+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  4:55PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great.
