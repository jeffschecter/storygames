The purpose would be to give other players, who've yet to play the games, an idea of whether the game is a good fit for them. We would also discuss what we consider to be a games strengths and possibly where the game may have opportunities to grow. <br/><br/>The games we play are made by the creators in the "indie" space; the designers frequent this forum and other places, such as G+, where we all discuss games. I know many of these designers, respect them and consider many friends, and the last thing I would want to do is to cause resentment or hurt feelings. Would it be best to completely remove the discussion of where we think the game could grow, even if we emphasized the positive aspects of the game and focused on what type of game it was and the type of tastes it would appeal to? Would including any information about where the game could grow even be useful; is there a role for constructive suggestions or of discussing areas where we had some difficulties in play? <br/><br/>I know it takes me a lot of time to see what type of game is a good fit for our players, and to decide what game I want to invest time in, and I certainly don't have time to go through all my games in a way that would give me anything but a superficial idea; games can seem like a good fit but turn out to be the opposite. There just isn't much out there, in terms of comprehensive discussion and review of what type of audience would be a good fit for a particular game, of the indie games we play. I really like how Ben Lehman makes clear the type of players who would like his games and the type of players who wouldn't. <br/><br/>One option I've considered, it to only review games that I would personally recommend, that way there would be pretty much zero risk of causing hurt feelings. <br/><br/>Anyway, how would you go about doing this without causing resentment, hurt feelings, etc?  And, what approach would you take, that you think would be most helpful to other players in deciding what game they should play? What type of "review" would be most helpful to you?

Why would a designer who's already left the project behind want to read you second-guessing them? Rather, focus on describing what you understand the game to be, that's really the gist of what art reviewing is: you describe what it is, how well it is what it is, where it falls down or becomes particularly noteworthy, and perhaps, if you're so inclined, you might philosophize about the historical context, cultural significance or moral worth of being the kind of art that the piece you're reviewing is.<br/><br/>And if you don't understand something, then say so - the most common way for a reviewer to fail is when they do not recognize their own ignorance. It is entirely acceptable to say when you don't understand, and in fact it is admirable because it shows that Socrates has more sense than the nine other dentists who decided to speak their mind in ignorance.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're really the most interested in giving constructive criticism to game designers, perhaps out of simple joy in the art, then I suggest focusing on studio critique, playtesting and other such ways in which you can help other people in their game development. That's a community-positive activity to partake in, and it may be both educational and artistically satisfying. But it is not the same thing as reviewing published games - treating the latter like games in development is just rude.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One option I've considered, it to only review games that I would personally recommend, that way there would be pretty much zero risk of causing hurt feelings.

I can certainly say that I've made a mess of negative reviewing myself more times than I'd care to.<br/><br/>Were I doing a review series myself today, I would pay particular attention to one thing when it comes to negative reviews: I would attempt to write with compassion rather than malice. It is much too easy to take on the role of a know-it-all, reveling in the stupidity of another's work. The only payoff from that, though, is the poisonous satisfaction of metaphorically kicking a person in a weaker position, and perhaps the dubious admiration of an audience that gets visceral enjoyment out of seeing a reviewer eviscerate a work with malice. I would still write the negative reviews, but I would pay attention to being a better person in this regard. It might presumably lessen the hurt feelings, too.<br/><br/>Regarding the technical goal of informing people, I myself like to go heavily qualitative in reviewing. I define categories and slot games into them. I make recommendation lists. I label things a lot. Instead of giving out X stars out of five, I prefer to give out stickers or labels, contextual pass/fail diagnostics. Something is "legit" or it is "unhygienic", rather than something is "3/5". I find that this makes me a better reviewer in general, although I imagine that it's rather a matter of taste [grin].<br/><br/>Aside from that it's like I said above: you need to tell what the piece you're reviewing is and where it falls down or shines in comparison to its ideals. You need to tell it when you don't understand something (which is also valuable information to your audience - they need to know if a work is difficult to understand). You want to, if you can, provide historical and cultural context for the work and your exegesis of it. Ideally you'll arrive to a conclusion where you determine who will benefit from the work, and who won't, in terms of interest and exposure and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466955/#Comment_466955" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-11T20:25:48+00:00" title="October 11, 2017  8:25PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2017 3:24PM by DeReel.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like reviews that detail the box, put hands on, and give detailed ratings, such as "skill level", "rules redaction", etc. Of course, the overall experience is important, but are not the focus of the reviews.
