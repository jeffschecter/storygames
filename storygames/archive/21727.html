Things that might distance them?  What good is coming together, if there isn't a clear, if only superficial reason, why they're apart?<br/><br/>In The Breakfast Club, the characters outwardly are different, and more than just  different, they contrast one another, superficially.   But it's all just outward appearances, I mean it's a bit more than that, but mostly.   <br/><br/>This outward contrast, is what makes them seem so unique.  A contrast highlights the original aspect it's contrasting.  It's why heroes are only as good as their villains.  <br/><br/>I was thinking about a set-up where you would describe your character by throwing another character under the bus.   You'd describe your character by adding what you view or what your character views as negative traits, to another player's character.<br/><br/>"(insert name of another character here)isn't(insert adjective)like me".<br/> or<br/>"(insert name of another character)doesn't have(insert noun)like me".<br/><br/>Maybe do all this round-robin style?  One at a time, like Fiasco.  <br/>Maybe include examples of opposites for players?<br/><br/>I guess the characters have to start off divided, so maybe the first thing that needs to happen is to separate them, by the superficial, petty and real things that separate us.   <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475232/#Comment_475232" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-05T15:26:54+00:00" title="July  5, 2018  3:26PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been a while since I've read it, and it's hard to find, but I think <i>Silver &amp; White</i> might cover this genre pretty nicely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475239/#Comment_475239" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-05T21:17:48+00:00" title="July  5, 2018  9:17PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, there's nothing dramatic in what characters are at the beginning...
