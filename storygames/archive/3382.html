It started three years ago with a traditional GM - player relationship and a fairly traditional group.  It was put on hold for a while, then re-started last year with three of the original five players and three new ones.  In the mean time, we had all tried a lot of different story games and had developped a taste for distributed story authority.  At the time, we were using the <i>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</i> 2e system, but even with this system, we <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2041" rel="nofollow">gradually started riffing</a> when I invited the players to frame scenes and add elements to the story.  <br/><br/>Since then, we have transitioned to the <i>Truth &amp; Justice</i> system, which supports our style very well.  We have been having more and more player-generated story elements, which now include creating clues and flashbacks for the main mysteries.  It developped fairly organically, as the players were using Hero Points to add minor (1 pt), significant (2 pts) or major (4pts) story elements.  I was already giving them colour scenes (more or less as used in <i>Burning Empires</i>) for free.  It was a natural step to give more and more authority, and it seemed to become a sub-game of its own for us to keep track of all the clues generated and tie them into a coherent story.  <br/><br/>For example, a few episodes ago one player described a strange vision where his character, who has the super-power Post-Cognition, saw the victim of a Ripper-style murder killed in a way that appeared impossible.  The rule was that he had to have an explanation for it.  I said OK to the scene, but added another detail that (unknown to me) made <i>his</i> explanation more difficult to support, but I too had to have an explanation.  So at any given time, when someone adds a significant detail, they have to have a possible solution, but this will not necessarily turn out to be the <i>final</i> solution to the mystery.  As GM, I do retain the authority to add "But..." at the end of every new detail.<br/><br/>As a result, the players were reporting this weekend that they were happy with the game because they still don't know how things will turn out, and yet they really feel like they are participating in creating the story.  Some confessed they hadn't thought it could work originally, because we would lose the surprise when anyone could just decide what "the" solution is, but we never ended up using that tack.  The topper is that things are getting increasingly complex in the story, yet increasingly easier for me as GM!  I can do minimal preparation, largely limited to keeping a good inventory of on-going plot threads, character agendas, and clues.<br/><br/>Have other people tried toeing that line between the players-as-authors and the players-as-audience (rather than the author/actor balancing act I'm more familiar with)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76543/#Comment_76543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T18:35:58+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  6:35PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see this as a different continuum than you have identified, but this is cool. <br/><br/>I like that the detail you introduced contradicted what the player thought was going on. I think that is crucial here.  That is half of the thrill of the "revelation of something outside me" pleasure (the other half is the reveal of what is 'actually happening') - the idea that 'wow, I thought this, but I was wrong, now I really want to know what's happening!'.  If you had, by contrast, just supported what the player thought was going on, it would have been fun in a creative way, but not in a revelatory way.<br/><br/>What if we borrowed something from Clue?

Could something like this work?<br/><br/>1. the group creates a set of character names and describes how they are related to each other. At this point backgrounds are not fleshed out.<br/>2. A victim character is randomly determined and the group decides on a brief background. The rest of the characters are suspects.<br/>3. Now scene framing begins. First the facilitator fleshes out the murder scene along with any apparent cause of death etc.<br/>4. Next come motive scenes, where one by one, each character is shown to have motive and opportunity to commit the deed.<br/>5. Then there are clue scenes, in which each scene must point the finger at a randomly determined suspect.<br/>6.  Once all suspects have at least one clue pointing to their guilt, the end game condition is met.<br/>7.  Now begin the exoneration scenes, where the group has to do the reverse. Each scene will exonerate one of the characters, explaining away the clues that were found before.<br/>8. The last character remaining is the murderer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76756/#Comment_76756" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T03:23:56+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  3:23AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Here's a rough outline for a cluelike game.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=192" rel="nofollow">And another</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76776/#Comment_76776" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T08:12:00+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  8:12AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about a mechanic that would force a character to gather everyone and explain what they thought was happening, and the first 2-3 characters (the number could vary depdending on length of session and size of group) were required to be proven wrong at some point?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76783/#Comment_76783" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T09:31:16+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  9:31AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>How about a mechanic that would force a character to gather everyone and explain what they thought was happening, and the first 2-3 characters (the number could vary depdending on length of session and size of group) were required to be proven wrong at some point?</blockquote>\nYou could tie it to a time limit.
