The basic idea is that it is a very low setup time game, where everything is defined during play by a resource called <b>presence</b>, which everyone starts with. When you run out of your starting presence the only way to get more is to overcome pitfalls set in your way, so basically you are defining yourself through action.<br/><br/>The other facet of the game is that you create a nemesis to defeat. The game is split into 3 acts and a finale. In each act each player takes it in turns to frame a scene, maybe gaining a resource, history or trait that adds to their <b>depth</b>. Each scene they frame they gain <b>momentum</b> as well, which is essentially the force of the plot against their character. If, at the start of a scene, a player has more momentum then depth then they must frame a nemesis scene, and flesh him out a bit more.<br/><br/>Simple, I think.<br/><br/>The problem is that I have been inside the game so long that I am getting stuck as I approach the end. Their are some small things that need sorted and I keep getting myself in a muddle as to how to fix them. <br/><br/>1) At the moment there are a limited number of things a player can do to their character in a scene, and that is currently making it very hard to define yourself through action. If you create a pitfall, which you do as an action, and then overcome it that takes up your two slots for a scene and doesn't allow you to increase your depth which would be ideal. I could just increase it to 3 slots but that has proved too powerful in the past and negates the delicate momentum/depth balance.<br/><br/>2) I was explaining the game to a friend the other night and she said that she couldn't really identify with the characters and that it was more storytelling than roleplaying. This is a fair point but it got me wondering if the game should involve the players more.<br/><br/>3) At the moment you basically set pitfalls for yourself which is a bit dull. One idea is to have scene framing such that the narrator says what they want to do and the other players round the table narrate enemy, allies and further complications into the scene.<br/><br/>4) We were discussing over on the CE forums whether the game is Sim or not. Now I don't really care too much for those definitions, I just design a game until it works and if people want to call it that then fine. I was wondering what opinion here would be though.<br/><br/>Well that is all for now, I can email anyone a copy of the game if they want to get a more indepth look at it.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90024/#Comment_90024" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T04:51:04+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  4:51AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2007 4:52AM by Graham.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gosh, that's lots of questions.\n<blockquote>1) At the moment there are a limited number of things a player can do to their character in a scene, and that is currently making it very hard to define yourself through action.

OK.<br/><br/>What would you <i>want</i> a player to do during a scene? It sounds as though you want something like:<br/><br/><i>1. Tackle a difficulty (whether that's already created or not)<br/>2. Add something to your character based on the result</i><br/><br/>so that, as you say, you're defining your character through action. If the difficulty is, say, a guard; and you pull out a gun and shoot him; then you add the trait "Big gun".<br/><br/>Taking that in conjunction with your third point:\n<blockquote>3) At the moment you basically set pitfalls for yourself which is a bit dull.</blockquote>\nit'd go something like:<br/><br/><i>1. Overcome a difficulty that's created by someone else (either on the spot or previously)<br/>2. Add something to your character based on the result</i><br/><br/>If you want that, you could change the central mechanics to do that.<br/><br/>I am getting the feeling that the central mechanics need a big tweak of some sort: at the moment, it looks as though you've got the classic problem that the most <i>effective</i> way to play isn't the most <i>fun</i>.<br/><br/>By the way, the problem about setting pitfalls for yourself is a classic Forgey thing. It's variously called the Lesson From Chalk Outlines or the Czege Principle. Might be worth a search.\n<blockquote>4) We were discussing over on the CE forums whether the game is Sim or not. Now I don't really care too much for those definitions, I just design a game until it works and if people want to call it that then fine. I was wondering what opinion here would be though.</blockquote>\nI do understand the suspicion of those definitions.<br/><br/>I guess I think it might help to clarify whether Reel Adventures is:<br/><br/>1. A celebration of action movies, where we all revel in taking part in our own action movie (Simulationism)<br/>2. A character-based game about heroism or (Narrativism)<br/>3. A game where the fun is in the narrator throwing down challenges to the players (Gamism)<br/><br/>(I don't really think it's 3, just including it for completeness).<br/><br/>I'm not an expert on these terms, by the way, so I may be using them wrong. But I <i>do</i> know that, when designing A Reason To Murder, I wanted the game to be:<br/><br/>1. A celebration of English murder mysteries<br/>2. An exploration of family relationships and<br/>3. A game where you try to pin the murder on someone else<br/><br/>And, once I realised I couldn't do all of those in one game, it got easier.<br/><br/>If you decide that (whether it's a celebration of action movies or a character-driven game), I think that'll solve your second problem:\n<blockquote>2) I was explaining the game to a friend the other night and she said that she couldn't really identify with the characters and that it was more storytelling than roleplaying. This is a fair point but it got me wondering if the game should involve the players more.</blockquote>\nIf the fun lies in celebrating action movies, identifying with characters <i>doesn't matter</i>: they'll probably be generic as all hell. If it's a game about characters, the characters are <i>all that matter</i>.<br/><br/>How does that sound? Does any of it make sense?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90248/#Comment_90248" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T15:15:31+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  3:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wise words mr. walmsley and and your advice to go back to the start was great. I was just getting a bit lost with the game. <br/><br/>I have decided that Reel Adventures is a Sim game, which is surprising but heh that is where it has ended up.<br/><br/>So I do want something like you are suggesting. What i am thinking of is removing the physical, social and mental stats I had and defining everyone through backgrounds. So for instance if you had background as a cop you could add tratis to it like 'shooting, negotiator' etc. that could help you out. <br/><br/>I think the other problem was making sure the players were fighting against the nemesis all the time. I am replacing the momentum vs. depth mechanic with a threat pool that fulfills a similar job. Whenever the heroes want they can try and stake some threat on the outcome of a scene. If they win it gets reduced, if not it gets increased. Does that sound interesting enough?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90488/#Comment_90488" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T08:07:28+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  8:07AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you're making some big changes since I went round that night. As always, it doesn't matter what I want from your game, it matters what you want it to be, so I'm glad you're only taking some of my advice. I know I look for games where I identify strongly with my character, so if something is billed as an RPG, that's what I expect to see; this isn't always true though, but I would recommend that you take into account people's expectations when pitching your game to the crowds and masses. I've been involved in several games which people didn't really expect to be high in the character interaction but which <i>I</i> thought would be, so I was quite unsatisfied because I didn't realise why no-one was playing the game 'right'.<br/><br/>Regarding your post and ideas: I'd worry about allowing the Threat pool to reduce too much; you have to build to a climax in an action movie. It is true that the threat has to be completely nullified at the end though, so perhaps you could work that it somehow...?<br/><br/>I like the idea of removing the totally arbitrary stats and replacing them with backgrounds; I think you might have noticed the stress I was putting on motivation for action heroes, and I would say that background and motivation are the key reasons why Action Heroes do anything.<br/><br/>We should definitely get in some hardcore action movie viewing time at some point. Perhaps a day of Die Hard/Lethal Weapon/Dirty Harry-ing in the not too distant future?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90610/#Comment_90610" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T05:17:30+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  5:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am watching die hard right now as I post.<br/><br/>The idea behind threat now is that it would be possible to reduce it to 0 in the finale, but that would not be necessary. Dependent on how much would be left this would inform you how your film ends. Is the nemesis still alive? Does he have a son to carry on his work etc. Basically is there going to be a sequel. It will need careful balancing.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
