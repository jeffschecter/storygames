Back in 2000/2001 over on RPGnet there was a thread where we were exploring that sort of thing (realizing that this kind of stuff was going on, basically roleplaying in fan fiction), and discovered that there were no <b>fewer than five</b> Yahoo Group mailing list/play by posts where the members took on the roles of members of the 80s band <b>Duran Duran</b>. I shit you not. Many were just "normal" (band issues, travel, etc) and one was about how Duran Duran are here <i>to save the world</i> from some alien menace.<br/><br/>So, it's out there, and it's popular as heck, and so there's probably a lot of good or bad communities to watch and base your methodology upon.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117970/#Comment_117970" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-04T11:34:39+00:00" title="January  4, 2008 11:34AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>More exotically, you could play a Lexicon-like game, using the blog metaphor instead of the encyclopedia metaphor, and using linear time instead of the letters of the alphabet to move things forward.

I've been thinking about doing a fictional blog like that, but just me. And I've heard of a lot of play by blogs.  But I never thought of combining the two into awesome.<br/><br/>I have a bunch of friends who are in a popular blog type called Nexus.  The premise is that the setting is a Nexus of worlds. So, any character from anywhere can appear. I think they have Abe Lincoln, a bunch of anime characters (I think they have something like 20 Goku's*), characters from Babylon 5 and Farscape, and a cybernetic Care Bear in their game, to give you an idea.<br/><br/>*This is the biggest reason why I've never explored this mode of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118042/#Comment_118042" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-04T21:08:11+00:00" title="January  4, 2008  9:08PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2008 9:09PM by RichD.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ask an ye shall receive Jason.<br/><br/><a href="http://asylums.insanejournal.com/thecoldwar/profile" rel="nofollow">The Cold War</a><br/><br/>Its on hiatus for the moment while one of the mods finalizes her move but all the info and journals are intact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118411/#Comment_118411" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T02:52:09+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  2:52AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given that I have some gaming friends scattered across the continent, I'm starting to look into what form of online gaming to go with.

And that you were the trigger man in that drive through.  If you don't tell me about the locket Jimmy, I'm going to have to charge you with that murder.  And I might let it slip on the street to some of the Westsiders that it was you doing the drive by.<br/>\n<br/>\nJimmy:  No!  They'll kill me.  I have nothing to do with those guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nCop:  Well, Jimmy, as it stand that's how it's going to go down.  Any reason why I shouldn't tell the Westsiders that it was you?<br/>\n<br/>\nJimmy:  Fine!  I did it.  I broke in and took her jewelry.<br/>\n<br/>\nCop:  Where's the locket Jimmy?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAnd that's when it gets passed over to the player who knows the answer to the question (probably the GM).  He'll write the next section of dialogue.  In a play by post game of any sort, I can't really see why you'd even want to attempt line by line dialog between too parties if you don't have to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118871/#Comment_118871" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T16:10:57+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  4:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main reason in play-by-forum/play-by-blogs games that I have seen is that many, many of them are based on media properties (Harry Potter, soap operas, Duran Duran, etc.) where possession of and celebration of a character is the main buy-in for the game, not the narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118882/#Comment_118882" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T17:59:18+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  5:59PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think play by post/play by blog is probably not suited for the type of game where you cover everything.  Where it's all about where your character goes, each word he says, what he buys, what he does.  You know, the typical "What do you do next" style of RPGs.  Instead of simulating the experience of the character through all the parts of his life, you'd want to simulate the genre or explore themes.<br><br>I've been reading different people's play by post games and I'm beginning to think that some of the "indie" games that have come out over the last few years (or are coming out shortly) will likely work quite well.  Anything where you have all participants doing more than actor stance.  In a Wicked Age might be well suited, as an example.  Perhaps Donjon?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/george" title="george"><img alt="george" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/george">george</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118901/#Comment_118901" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T22:01:41+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 10:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2008 10:02PM by george.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite><br><br>In a Wicked Age might be well suited, as an example.
