The thing that specifically caught my ear was that not a lot of small press publishers are involved.<br/><br/>My question: have those of you who have self-published games been approached to participate in this activity (my suspicion: no)? Or did you simply decline?<br/><br/>I can't say I'm too excited about this. I mean, color me pessimistic, but I don't think White Wolf's <a href="http://www.white-wolf.com/index.php?line=news&amp;articleid=1121" rel="nofollow">Geist</a> or whatever else will show up is going to be that amazing, at least as far as my play preferences are concerned. But if, say, the demos that are run at Gencon for these indie games showed up at Free RPG day, I'd be totally stoked, and I'd imagine that it would be great publicity for you gamesmiths and the community in general. Is this possible for the future?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212798/#Comment_212798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T00:48:56+00:00" title="June 17, 2009 12:48AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got mixed feelings.<br/><br/>On one hand, I think giving stuff away is good.

It'd be nice, from the website, to feel Free RPG Day was a fun day of giving away RPGs. But what do I get? "Free RPG Day is now sold out to retailers" and "Impressions Advertising And Marketing".

You have to print either 600 or 1800 copies of a product in order to participate in the lowest levels of the promotion and these are distributed to participating retail stores, which then give them away however they see fit (I heard rumors that some places even sell them for $5).  Printing even 600 copies of anything is expensive for small press publishers, even if it's a little saddle-stitch booklet that costs a couple dollars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212840/#Comment_212840" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T05:59:29+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  5:59AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't speak generally but the local game stores in western Massachusetts and NYC let us add our games along side other free RPGs without having to meet those minimums or go through the program officially. None of the gaming stores I visited were selling these free RPGs (I'm sure it happens, just not what percent). That being said, it does cost a lot to print a small print run of even saddle stitched booklets to give away for possibly no return.

It seems to have stolen an idea that I have been floating for a campaign for some time (spirit mediums who have a support group in a shitty church basement with horrible coffee and donuts every two weeks) and spruced it up in the White Wolf way.<br/><br/>I also liked Rogue Trader but I still can't understand if I'm supposed to take Warhammer 40K seriously or not, and whether the answer to that question is "yes" or "no", what I am supposed to relate to about it.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D module actually I think is quite good for what Free RPG day should be and shows excellent packaging skills that people should take a look at.

For those who haven't seen DW, and who are interested in things retrogamey, it's worth checking out.  A somewhat Basic D&amp;Dish feel, with a few cool little twists of its own (like how armor works, or a somewhat standardized ability check), but with a very different world feel, somewhat more authentically medieval with fairy tale touches, compared to old skool D&amp;Ds pulp swords &amp; sorcery ethic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213940/#Comment_213940" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T15:02:40+00:00" title="June 22, 2009  3:02PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All in all, I thought the free stuff was worlds better than in past years:<br/><br/>- Dragon Warriors was pretty and awesome, looking exactly like a short indie game or playtest ashcan<br/>- Geist was gorgeous and kinda interesting; I only didn't pick it up because the first PC had "Tiger Style Kung Fu" which made me want to throw the book<br/>- Rogue Trader was gorgeous and 40K-tastic, didn't get it because I still haven't played Dark Heresy<br/>- Paranoia looked cheap and crappy in comparison, but it was mostly the old school Palladium-level layout, I think<br/>- the Eberron Adventure was pretty solid, but not playable on its own, which was an odd choice. They should have included the little quickstart from Shadowfell or Basic Set.  Also, I continue to find it really, truly baffling that D&amp;D adventures don't include all the maps you need to play the game at a size you can actually use.  Even a link to a downloadable PDF with extra maps would have been cool, or an indication of which Dungeon Tiles you need to buy.  Instead, you get an included piece of cardboard with maps for 10% of the included adventure and no guidelines for how you map the remaining encounters.  WTF, WOTC?<br/>- the Pathfinder monster book was pretty but completely disposable, mostly an add for Pathfinder, seems like<br/><br/>That was all that was left by the time I got there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Wiegand" title="Chris_Wiegand"><img alt="Chris_Wiegand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i1035.photobucket.com/albums/a438/clowndissection/icon2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Wiegand">Chris_Wiegand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214067/#Comment_214067" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T13:24:00+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  1:24PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the stuff I saw at my flgs was pretty disposable, but I think that Troll Lord did a really good job on their Castles &amp; Crusades Primer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nQuick start rules, character generation rules for four races and classes up to fourth level, plus a short adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214071/#Comment_214071" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T13:41:06+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  1:41PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C&amp;C Primer: aw man, I would have liked to get one of those!
