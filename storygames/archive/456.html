                    Following the first draft  of Jonathan Walton's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=422" rel="nofollow">A New Anthem</a> (about a month ago) there was a sidetrack discussion about gaming groups taking systems and adjusting (or "fudging") them to their liking. This is obviously a common phenomena, and always at a group's disposal, but the question remains how desirable is this phenomena?<br/><br/>My position was that given what I'd like to do with a game, I prefer a system that does this while requiring as little alteration as possible. The ideal system, then, would be one that I wouldn't have to change at all.<br/><br/>(This is not saying that I'd only ever use one system because it was "the best", but rather that a system would be best suitable for a specific style and gaming experience if it provided them with as little alteration as possible. This seems to be an obvious statement, but it's still important to make)<br/><br/>Chris Tatro's very wise response is hereby italicized:<br/><br/><i>So long as the designer and the gm/players are different people, I don't think you will EVER see a game played unfudged straight out of the box.<br/><br/>My personal philosophy on rpg rulesets is that they are toolboxes. They're full of stuff for me to use when I need it, but I sure don't need all of them every time. And sometimes, for some simple stuff I might not need any of the tools at all.</i><br/><br/><br/>Which makes me wonder. I mean, I know how I play it, and I know how my friends play it, but that's a very limited sampling. So:<br/><br/>Do you play games unfudged straight out of the box? <br/><br/>What are your views on altering a ready-made system? <br/><br/>Are these views different when it comes to "mainstream" vs. "indie" games (I can imagine someone would be more willing to mess with GURPS then Polaris, or vise versa)?<br/><br/>Where's your limit? Which is to mean, how hard will you work to change a system you see potential in rather then just trying something else?<br/><br/>And finally, what are your views on the toolbox analogy? Do you believe that your game is best played whole and should kept like that, or do you agree that players who know what they're doing should just pick and choose the ones they feel serve them best (let's assume these players already have some familiarity with the game, and are not working blindly)?                </div>

<p>If I need to change a system's actual honest-to-God rules in order for it to be fun for me then it's not well-written for my play priorities.</p>
<p>If <strong>everyone</strong> needs to change the systems rules (perhaps each in their own distinct way) in order for it to be fun for them then it's not well-written, period.</p>

                            I agree with Tony. Although this is a recent thing for me. I used to tweak and modify every ruleset I ever came across, that is until I found Sorcerer and its ilk over at the Forge.<br/>
<br/>
I just ran a game of Dogs in the Vineyard following the rules to the letter and it was my best experience as a GM ever!<br/>
<br/>
I still enjoy tweaking rules though, but with some there's just no need. They're just that well designed.<br/>

                            More agreement here. I play games as written. <br/><br/>I have neither the time nor the inclination to tinker with rules these days. I'd rather play something that works as is.<br/><br/>That's not to say there's no place for toolbox type games, but it seems like the difference between buying a new car and an old one you need to fix up. Some people enjoy that fixing up, but most people want a car that just goes. Now.                        </div>

                            I have recent experience with The Shadow of Yesterday that's very similar to what Yoki says about his game of DitV.<br/>
<br/>
To compare that with having to ignore, strip away, change and in rare cases add stuff as used to be the case with the games I played ...<br/>
<br/>
I ain't looking back.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was one of the Joshuas that said "I want a game that says what it does and does what it says", and that holds true for me too.<br/>
<br/>
That said, TSOY also made me confident for the first time to tinker with with a game engine, and it gave me the tools to do so. To use what's there in form of Keys, Pools and Secrets made me want to set up a TSOY game the same way I see people do with Humanity, Descriptions and a One-Sheet in Sorcerer.<br/>
<br/>
But then I don't see that as altering, fudging or drift in any way.                        </div>

<p>I don't alter systems until I've played them.</p>
<p>I tend to shy away from games that <em>can</em> be played as toolboxes; I strongly prefer systems that function like well-built machines, where each mechanical part constributes crucially to the game experience. If the system isn't playing as hard as I am, then I could be using a better system.</p>

                            I've played Sorcerer as it was written. And Trollbabe. And Dogs in the Vineyard. And InSpectres (the, um, first edition, I think). And My Life With Master.

The idea that you have to fudge a game to play it, or that people will always automatically fudge a game to play it, is one of those myths of RPGs that needs to be flushed down the toilet.                        </div>

                            Hmm, in one sense, Chris is right, no one other than the designer plays exactly the same system, though it should be noted that group to group, or even week to week, the designer doesn't either. But this is getting really picky and taking the LP to it's fullest (since by the LP, system includes things like "who gets to sit in the beat up orange recliner").<br/>
<br/>
In a more reasonable and relaxed sense, there is truth that anyone other than the designer will play the system at least slightly differently. The question is to what extent can the differences be? Taking Dogs in the Vinyard as an example, while playing as strictly by the book as possible, it's still possible for one GM to run a game that another GM would observe as very different. Why? What is a legitimate raise or see in your game? I bet each of us has slightly different standards.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think it is possible to play games "by the book," and be playing something the designer would feel is the game he designed. It does require the game be well written.<br/>
<br/>
I remember way back in college when I realized for the first time that I could take a game text and feel comfortable running it without changing it. Now the particular game text in question was incomplete (Cold Iron), and true, I did choose to drop a spell or two. But it was far cry from D&amp;D/AD&amp;D where I had, with the help of a couple friends, typed everything of importance to me into the computer, and changed things that I didn't agree with (by the end of my second year of grad school, I no longer needed to carry ANY of the TSR books with me).<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there I decided that it was important to run the game as written at least once before starting to make changes (one should note that I was already changing D&amp;D before I ran it the very first time - using the original 1977 Basic D&amp;D set). These days, I see many games that don't need to be changed to run. Honestly, even D&amp;D 3e, or at least Monte Cook's Arcana Unearthed/Evolved version, is something I can run, at least for a time, basically by the book. Dogs in the Vinyard is certainly something I would run unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also a lot less excited about toolkit games. I'm not sure I ever really was that excited. I long ago admitted that a "generic" system didn't really make sense, back after I tried running Fantasy Hero (which of course back then was not "generic" even if it used the same rules core as Champions). I was initially intrigued by Fudge, then totally dismissed it when I realized that setting it up to play felt like designing a game practically from scratch (ok, so you get a dice mechanic straight from the book, and there are a few sub-systems that you can pick and choose from, but nothing complete enough, at least for what I wanted to run).<br/>

                            So this is just me taking the title of the post perversely, but what if you treated a game as a "ready made"--a found object, a la Duchamp.<br/>
<br/>
That is: take a new game; follow its proceedures explicitly; do not attempt to make it 'work'; and treat the (probably dysfunctional) result as 'art'.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be funny, and not just because you'd be implicitly comparing the games to a urinal.                        </div>

I know just why it is that people do this. What is beyond me, though, is that the role-playing community is <i>the only friggin' community that does this</i>(*), and that's just plain weird.<br/><br/>Sports people don't do it. Basketball is the same all over the world. (Well, except in the States, but you guys are weird, and even then, it's the same all over the States.)<br/><br/>Board game guys don't do it. Advanced Squad Leader is the same all over the world. (Well, you'll find the occasional house rule, but to my knowledge, it's a rare exception indeed.)<br/><br/>Card game guys don't do it. Bridge is the same all over the world. (No, bidding conventions don't count.) (What about poker, you say? Poker isn't a game. Five card stud is a game. So is Texas Hold'em. Poker is a scoring mechanism. Deal with it.)<br/><br/>So. I need to get back to the original questions. I've pretty much answered the second one, by the way, but I'll give you an answer for the first one as well.<br/><br/>I play games I know nothing about unfudged out of the box. (That's been everything except D&amp;D, so far.) I fudge D&amp;D like I'm on speeds. I fudged 3.0 before I ever played it.

<p>With games that come out of The Forge, yes. Otherwise, it depends.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>What are your views on altering a ready-made system?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If the system is tightly focused and I'm interested in the intent of the designer, then it'd be silly for me to alter the rules. This applies especially to indie games, which I'm playing with an eye to learning about Forge-influenced design philosophy.</p>
<p>I also believe that, in any case, a game should be played unaltered a bit before fiddling. Often a rule's purpose or effect won't be apparent until after several playthroughs. (On the other hand if you're setting out to create a homebrew, all bets are off.)</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Are these views different when it comes to "mainstream" vs. "indie" games (I can imagine someone would be more willing to mess with GURPS then Polaris, or vise versa)?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, as noted above. I'm rather a fan of unfocused games and I expect that, in the course of using them to realize my vision, I might alter, edit, tweak, bend, spindle, or mutilate the rules to bring them into focus.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Where's your limit? Which is to mean, how hard will you work to change a system you see potential in rather then just trying something else?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I'd rather add or subtract than fix fundamentally broken rules. I also don't see any point in trying to "fix" a system that's obviously designed to a completely different intent.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>And finally, what are your views on the toolbox analogy? Do you believe that your game is best played whole and should kept like that, or do you agree that players who know what they're doing should just pick and choose the ones they feel serve them best (let's assume these players already have some familiarity with the game, and are not working blindly)?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Basically, I think it depends on the tradition you're working out of. One of the attempts at defining Sim over on the Forge suggested that it entails "exalting the fiction". Going off that idea (and it's just a jumping off point, not an attempt to get into a GNS debate), I believe that a lot of groups have a type of play that they're aiming at (often a specific campaign world with a certain "feel"), so they seek rules to match that vision as closely as possible, then tinker to achieve an even closer fit.</p>

<code>Do you play games unfudged straight out of the box?</code><br/><br/>No -- and neither does anybody else who's already posted to this thread, no matter what they've said.  Their answers were focusing on the 'unfudged' part; but most if not everybody missed the 'straight out of the box' part.<br/><br/>You cannot play Dogs in the Vineyard straight out of the box.  It does not work that way.<br/><br/><code>What are your views on altering a ready-made system? </code><br/><br/>Here it's important what you mean by "system."  If you mean amending the published rules, well, that depends on the published rules in question.  This is especially important when we're talking about sets of published rules that, by their very construction, require additional rules provided by the players.<br/><br/>Dogs requires the "most critical player" rule.  It is not provided in the game text.  You must provide it.  Alternately, PTA Pitch Sessions, Capes Comics Codes, and Sorcerer "What Are Demons" are all required player "tweaking".  Just because the book explicitly calls for it does not make it different from another book that is designed assuming that you're going to do it.<br/><br/><code>Are these views different when it comes to "mainstream" vs. "indie" games (I can imagine someone would be more willing to mess with GURPS then Polaris, or vise versa)?</code><br/><br/>See above -- outside of the indie scene, most games are made with the assumption that they will be houseruled, or used only partially.  These games are designed with the implicit assumption that the players will be tweaking, house ruling, adding, subtracting, or otherwise 'fudging'.<br/><br/>Games, by their very nature, require player input to operate and to create direction.  No game plays "straight out of the box" and if it did, it would be a pretty unengaging game, that sat there and played itself while you were supposed to just sort of sit there in awe.  A good design offers that five-cornered box, provides the gaps, invites the player to step in and fiddle.  Otherwise, it's an objet d'art, not an interactive experience.                        </div>

                            JBR,<br/><br/>Maybe it's my insomnia talking, but I seriously have no idea what you're talking about. Here's how I interpreted the initial questions: you buy a board game, maybe it's Monopoly, maybe it's Risk, maybe it's Pirate's Cove. You bring it home, open up the box, read the rules, set up the game board, and play the game as the rules tell you to play.<br/><br/>Similarly, I got Sorcerer, Trollbabe, Dogs in the Vineyard, The Shadow of Yesterday, My Life With Master. I opened the games up, read the rules, set up the "game board," and played the game as the rules told me to play. I didn't have to, say, tweak the amount of Experience Points you get for killing monsters or let the wizard start with more spells or add a skill system into the rules or change the task resolution system to a conflict resolution system.<br/><br/>When gamers talk about "out of the box," isn't that what they mean? When gamers talk about "fudging rules," isn't that what they mean?                        </div>

                            Anymore, I play most games 'unfudged' in terms of the 'core' rules, but find myself adding new layers to the core, pushing them into different areas.  To give a kind of banal example from my 3.5 campaign, I use damage reduction rules 'straight out of the box' but have created new categories of it to reflect elements unique to my campaign.  I wouldn't call this fudging but it isn't really straight out of the box, either.<br/>
<br/>
I think this may provide the answer, too, for why we roleplayers are tweakers.  A RPG is an expressive medium--you are trying to provide rules that govern a narrative experience.  Plenty of rpg's have some 'flex' and deliberately so--a story isn't a flowchart and the rules need to allow for that.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as we go along, we come across stories that we want to tell but which don't quite fit the rules we have.  What do we do?  Simple, we start playing with the rules to make them fit our new premise.  Sometimes, this works quite well, when the rules are relatively well-suited to the (new) premise.  On the other hand, sometimes the rules are very poorly suited to the premise and you end up with a franken-game, a monstrosity of ad hoc rule-premise grafting.  I personally began digging into indie games for just this reason--look, build the rules around the premise!<br/>
<br/>
I find myself less tempted to tweak indie games--they tell you the purpose for which the rules were built so I know whether they will do something I like or not.  If anything, I just outright steal from them to use a cool mechanical element for a game of my own.  My temptation to 'fudge' indie games usually occurs in terms of setting rather than rules--more like changing the clothes than altering the body.  (All this said, I haven't played a whole lot of indie games, so perhaps that would change with more experience, but I don't think so).<br/>

                            I don't see any difference between fudging a rule and creating a character, as far as adding something to the game that wasn't there before.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the days of Vampire 1ed, there was a huge amount of designer notes in the back of the book about "how you should play", which I ignored when I was making my Nixon White House-inspired cabals and conspirators. I followed the "rules" with respect to character creation but was creating something absolutely against the game design.<br/>
<br/>
In my current Gotham City Adventure! game, I made up some new supernatural abilities to reflect those of ghosts and some of the other eerie powers of the antagonists in that setting. I did not follow the rules with respect to character creation, but was creating something that didn't disrupt the game as my Vampire 1ed games did.<br/>
<br/>
Some days I may be doing something that doesn't break the rules, technically, but is, nevertheless, absolutely outside what the game indicates (or a designer intends) should be done. Some days I might be doing something that does break the rules, technically, but is inside what the game indicates (or a designer intends) should be made. Some days I perform actions both mechanically and thematically appropriate. It's a wide ole world out there.  <br/>
<br/>
The same as everyone else, I'm bringing something new to the game the very first time I open my mouth to say "I check the door for traps" or "we ride into town" or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
It's different from board games and card games, your input in those games is pretty limited and there are a set number of legal moves. <br/>
<br/>
(For counterexamples, look at Once Upon A Time - a card game where your input is extraordinarily unlimited, and which is subject to very similar concerns and social pressures that RPGs are....or the lesbian stripper ninja talking to the Khan RPG that recently was published, in which there are only a few stylized "moves" that the two players can make and other moves are just as illegal as moving your rook diagonally in chess. By my theory, it would be possible to play the latter without straying from the rules, and not be possible to play the former without it, but these are clearly unusual outliers.)<br/>
<br/>
There's something else floating around this analysis about designer intent but I'll let this simmer for a bit.                        </div>

<p>Preferably. I usually buy games with an eye on "<strong>that's</strong> what I'd like to play" as opposed to "I'm gonna tweak that then it will work out right". For setting it's usually somewhat the opposite... but I digress.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>What are your views on altering a ready-made system?</p>

<p>Much like yours, that is to say I'd prefer to do it as little as possible.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Are these views different when it comes to "mainstream" vs. "indie" games (I can imagine someone would be more willing to mess with GURPS then Polaris, or vise versa)?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It's easier to grok what an "indie" game is about, and chances are higher that an "indie" game will achieve its design goal. They're usually more focused than "mainstream" games, and have a smaller chance at ruleset clutter or points where the game "breaks". So insofar as I'd <em>prefer</em> to alter an existing system as little as possible, with most "mainstream" games I've played it's usually inevitable to some extent.</p>
<p>From another POV, "indie" games tend to have a "toolbox" mindset as far as <em>setting</em> is concerned. This I actually like, because it aids people create imaginary stuff instead of chewing it for them beforehand. In a sense, "indie" systems are more rules-"transparent" (ugh) this way, as they make me trust the rules a lot more and invest my creative energies in the chewy stuff.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Where's your limit? Which is the mean, how hard will you work to change a system you see potential in rather then just trying something else?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hard to gauge. Sometimes the process itself becomes quite fun and rewarding (when the tweaks are small and few and improve my gameplay a lot). But let me tell you, years of rewriting xD&amp;D "the way it should be" were quite enough, thank you very much. My patience for drift is much, much shorter.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>And finally, what are your views on the toolbox analogy?

</div></blockquote>
<p>FWIW, I don't think many games publish themselves as "toolbox" games, first and foremost. Most try to present themselves as complete rulesets, Golden Rules notwithstanding. I like to play with my toolboxes in other places (Operating Systems, for example) but not in games.</p>

                            Shit, Josh and JD are agreeing on something. Must be true. That or it must be evil. <br/><br/>So, to put what they've already said in my terms: <br/><br/>You can play Ticket to Ride right out of the box. This is because there is nothing in Ticket to Ride that requires any investment from the players other than about an hour of time. You take it out, you count the trains, you deal the cards, you play. Play Ticket to Ride with just about anyone one earth, and you get about the same results. <br/><br/>You cannot play Dogs right out of the box. Besides the fact that you have to make towns and characters -- adding something to the game not already there -- you (more importantly) have to add your own issues to the game. Furthermore, you have to bring your own judgement to the game: both about the fiction and (through the most critical player rule) about the way the game itself should run. Part of Dogs says "run this the way your group runs this" -- which is something you don't see in Ticket to Ride. Playing Sorcerer makes this even more obvious, as unless you have a strong group definition of humanity (and demons) play isn't going to go all that well. Sorcerer needs you to bring the things that squick you, or else it isn't gonna be fun. As a result you'll almost never get the same results from Sorcerer when playing with different people. <br/><br/>That is why the "out of the box" issue gets weird with a lot of RPGs. What you can do with boardgames, you can't do with many RPGs because of the very element that makes many of us love RPGs: personal investment. <br/><br/>(Of course, if you're playing a D&amp;D game with pregen characters and a pregen dungeon like the mid-period boxed set, you probably could play right out of the box. That's the point at which the boardgame/RPG divide starts to crumble.) <br/><br/>Now, unlike JD, I do differentiate this from changing the system or "fudging" for one simple reason. When, in Dogs, you make a town, make moral judgements, and have the most critical player decide on specific interpretations you are doing what the game tells you to do. You've added something, yes, but you haven't change the fundmental procedure of play. Ditto Sorcerer and deciding humanity. You're not out of the box anymore, you're making your own thing, but you are doing so according to the procedures of play laid out in the book. <br/><br/>This is significantly different than when you fudge a rule in a game in order to change the procedures and methods of play. If you were to play Sorcerer without humanity at all, that would be a fudge. If you were to play Mutants and Masterminds without capping powers at level, that would be a fudge. If you play GURPS by replacing the dice with tarrot cards, that is most certainly a fudge. When you do something that changes the way the game works, rather than just adding material in a manner the game already intends for you to do, you are fudging the rules. <br/><br/>With those responses in mind:<br/><br/><code>Do you play games unfudged straight out of the box?</code><br/>Unfudged, sometimes. Straight out of the Box, rarely. I don't like pregenned games, so the SootB isn't something I want from a game. A lot of Indy games and a handful of mainstream games (Mutants and Masterminds, Unknown Armies) I play straight by the rules. But even then its no "straight down the line" as I've made some minor changes here and there to things like Burning Wheel and Shadows of Yesterday, in order to make the engine do more of what I want. <br/><br/><code>What are your views on altering a ready-made system?</code><br/>I will usually try to run a game straight at least a few times, in order to get to fully understand the way it works. After that, however, I'll almost always start to develop my own set of customiszations. Sometimes this is just a system of interpretation (one that scriptural scholars would be familiar with), other times it is outright changes to process. <br/><br/><code>Where's your limit? Which is the mean, how hard will you work to change a system you see potential in rather then just trying something else?</code><br/>If a game lets me make changes but doesn't require it, I'm happy. If a game requires me to cludge it in order to work at all, I am unhappy. So I still thinkg BW and SoY are awesome games -- because they didn't require the changes I made to work. The changes I made just made them work better for me. OTOH, Exalted first edition (haven't tried second) is a game that causes me constant iritation these days because the games I'm in that run with it have to have a constant process of houseruling in order to stay functional. <br/><br/><code>And finally, what are your views on the toolbox analogy? Do you believe that your game is best played whole and should kept like that, or do you agree that players who know what they're doing should just pick and choose the ones they feel serve them best (let's assume these players already have some familiarity with the game, and are not working blindly)?</code><br/>Depends on the game. This, really, is asking me to judge between two different philosophies and find one superior to the other -- which I don't do. Dogs, which is pretty fucking narrow down the line, is an awesome game. Fudge (especially when played with FATE), which is pretty much not narrow down any line, is also an awesome game. Really, this one is just a matter of how your game process works and what the intended effects, audience and (da dum!) marketing of the game is.                        </div>

                            Okay, then I've obviously misunderstood what "out of the box" meant. I've always used the term to mean "I can play this game by reading the rules and following the rules as written." Personal investment didn't have anything to do with it. Creating towns in DitV didn't have anything to do with it, as long as you're following the rules on town creation. This other interpretation of "out of the box" (you don't add anything to the game) seems a bit weird to me, since adding to the game is following the rules of the game as written. The characters and towns are already in DitV (to use that game as an example), in the rules for creating them. They exist in their potential, and if you follow the rules of the game, you bring them into existence to play with. To me, it's like saying you can't play Ticket to Ride out of the box because you have to set up the board first. Or am I missing something?                        </div>

                            Out of the Box -- presumably, everything you need to play is inside the box (or book), and you just need to take it out in order to play.  This is not the case with 99% of RPGs (the 1% being those pregenned dungeoncrawls Brand mentioned).

<blockquote>RPGs by their very natures do not have everything you need to play inside the box</blockquote>
I'm not convinced this is the case. I mean, in most (not all) RPGs, you have to create characters to play. The setting may need to be elaborated on by one or more players. Situation may not come ready-made in the rules. I don't see this as really much different than setting up the board to play Risk or Clue or Pirate's Cove. I mean, you <i>literally</i> cannot play Pirate's Cove "out of the box," because you have to set up the board, place Legendary Pirate ships, set up the Tavern and Treasure cards, and decide who will be which color ship. You can, however, set all of that up and play the game by the rules as written. Similarly, you can set up "the board" for Dogs in the Vineyard and play the game by the rules as written. I'm seriously not seeing much of a difference between the two. To say that you <i>can't</i> play an RPG "out of the box" because you first have to make characters (which isn't true for all RPGs) and establish the setting (not true for all RPGs) and set up a situation (not true for all RPGs) seems to be taking the phrase "out of the box" far, far too literally to make the phrase much use at all.
<blockquote>RPGs require not only player operation, but player investment.</blockquote>
I don't buy this at all. Investment is an internal thing. You can look for clues to see whether another player is invested or not, but I don't believe you can point to them and say, "Yes, I can see that you are objectively invested in this game." I also don't believe investment is a prerequisite for RPGs and not for other games.<br/><br/>EDIT: If this is derailing the discussion of playing games "out of the box," I'm more than willing to concede that we have different approaches to this and let it drop.                        </div>

                            Joshua -- it's not that there are steps you need to do in order to set up play.  You're right -- you have to place ships in starting positions, or deal out hex tiles to build Catan.  The distinction is whether or not that procedure requires input from outside.  When I make a character, I am using my real-life experiences and my real-life aesthetic preferences of what makes a good character for my purposes in the game.  I say, "I'll make a guy like Pablo Picasso but a sculptor, instead."  When you place those starting ships, you're thinking, "Well, I can place it on any one of these ten places."  Your consideration never goes outside the box.<br/><br/>As for investment and operation -- have you ever <em>enjoyed</em> a RPG that you didn't care about your character, the situation, or the setting?                        </div>

                            Guys, I can't help think we're toeing the line of Theory Wankery here.  The analogy _du jour_ seems to be to boardgames, and it seems to be valid.  So, by analogy:<br/>
<br/>
*Pictionary*<br/>
<br/>
Does one not play Pictionary out of the box?  But I draw pictures, and they weren't there before.  Certainly I'm not fudging the rules.  fap fap fap.<br/>
<br/>
If the game tells you "in order to play, you need to decide these things," the decisions you make are not "fudges" and aren't usefully different from out of the box play, any more than the characters you bring to any game would be.  Unless you're then arguing that no RPG is ever played out of the box, and you've just argued the term into meaninglessness.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a meaningful, legitimate distinction between "out of the box" and "as the author intended?"  I'm excepting degrees of precision, since I'll grant that with minimal perversion you could read "as the author intended" to include really serious fudging, since the author expects that the game will be played 70% as written, whereas "out of the box" implied a tighter fidelity to the game as written, regardless of the author's intent.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimate point: "out of box" meaning "everythings in there" applies to pregenned dungeoncrawls and reality television.  Outside that scope, that definition is useless.  There is a reasonable connotation of "stock, unchanged" which is useful, though, and I'd suggest that that be the definition worth using.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think the Wikipedia entry would have to include a treatment of the "everything's in there" meaning because that observation is definitely worthy: if the game is worth anything at all, it's because the players brought something to it.  Games are not passive entertainment.                        </div>

<code>Unless you're then arguing that no RPG is ever played out of the box, and you've just argued the term into meaninglessness.</code><br/>Except we obviously haven't. <br/><br/>Why are boardgames different than RPGs? Where is the difference? As many folks start talking about making RPGs more like boardgames in the context of fast in play, being playable without prep by either GMs or players, pregenerated scenarios and ideas (Mountain Witch and such) and in very limited time spans (all entries in this years Iron Game Chef), we're going to have to start looking very seriously at "theory wanking" divisions like these. <br/><br/>Because if you say that Pictionary and Sorcerer are played pretty much the same way, and that one can't judge the differences in investment between them, nor the differences in mode of play and interaction, then we're pretty much just tossing our hands in the air and going "hell, its all the same anyway!" <br/><br/>And I think that is exactly where the differentiations are coming from. Joshua BishopRoby, for example, has been doing a lot of design work (Web of Shadows, Agora) that move away from a lot of RPG assumptions and towards types of play normally seen in boardgames or CCGs. So it only makes sense that he'd be thinking about the terms used with a very critical and precise eye. Just because others haven't been thinking about them other than in generalities doesn't mean that there isn't a good reason for Josh, JD, or I to be more specific in our needs.                        </div>

                            JBR,<br/><br/>Ah, okay. It seems to me that since outside input is required for (or at the very least typical of) RPGs, that "influence from the outside" is inside the box. That is, if you can't play the game without it, it's not something you bring to the game frivolously, it's required. Now, if you take that to mean you <i>cannot</i> play an RPG "out of the box," then the phrase "out of the box" is meaningless to RPGs. So, if someone asks, "Do you generally play RPGs out of the box," the question is meaningless.<br/><br/>Which seems...well, it seems silly to me. A much more sensible approach (to me) is to assume that "out of the box" means something different to RPGs than it does to board games. For one thing, most RPGs don't come in a box. You <i>literally</i> cannot play My Life With Master out of the box because it <i>literally</i> doesn't come in a box. So if I ask you if you play MLWM out of the box, I obviously don't mean it literally. Which is why I stand by my answer: yes, I've played My Life With Master  "out of the box"--that is, I read the rules and played the game following the rules, just as I would do with a well-made board game.<br/><br/>As for your other question:
<blockquote>As for investment and operation -- have you ever enjoyed a RPG that you didn't care about your character, the situation, or the setting?</blockquote>
Have I enjoyed an RPG where I didn't care about my character? Yes. Have I enjoyed an RPG where I didn't care about the setting? Yes. Have I enjoyed an RPG where I didn't care about the situation? I'm not sure. I played some D&amp;D and Gamma World in junior high where the character I made was about as important to me as a token in Monopoly. Playing the character was like playing Prof. Plum in Clue. The setting was a dungeon or town or ruined city, with nothing beyond really detailed or thought about. The situation was "there are monsters and treasure--kill the monsters and get the treasure." I can't say I was any more invested in that than in playing Risk or Pirate's Cove. But it was a hell of a lot of fun at the time. I don't think that's particularly odd for RPGs, either.                        </div>

And then suddenly the whole "out of the box" issue has meaning again.                        </div>

                            My questions answered to satisfaction, I allow the thread to derail.<br/>

(And for the record, by "out of the box" I meant "using only the rules and directives the author included in the game", but this new debate is interesting too)<br/>

Thanks everybody who answered, you've given me exactly the input I needed for my next post on low-impact play (though it might still be a while until it's posted, given that I've got a busy week and a giant convention next week).                        </div>

<code>Have I enjoyed an RPG where I didn't care about my character? Yes. Have I enjoyed an RPG where I didn't care about the setting? Yes. Have I enjoyed an RPG where I didn't care about the situation? I'm not sure.</code><br/><br/>Sorry, my language was less than clear.  Have you ever enjoyed any one game where you did not care about at least one of those three things?  That's what I meant.<br/><br/>In any case, this is all Book versus Game stuff again.  An actual game of anything is not composed solely of the rules presented in the Book.  There is always something added, in terms of social contract, player expectations, player aesthetics, and the social reality of the game.  You can parse the "out of the box" or "fudging" thing as either:<br/><br/>(a) We used only the rules presented in the book and nothing else<br/>(b) We used all of the rules presented in the book without changing anything (but added in our other-stuff rules)<br/><br/>Point being, (a) doesn't happen, period.  (b) might happen, but I imagine that it happens a lot less than folks believe it does.  Does the GM roll damage for every NPC every time, or does he at some point go, "Okay, that's enough of <em>that</em>.  He dies."  Also and importantly, (b) only works if none of the published rules contradict each other -- which is relatively rare.<br/><br/>More importantly, though, we need to recognize that lots of rules, lots of what I'd call good rules, and lots of the rules that tend to appear in indie games, not only are aware of the fact that the published rules are not the sum total of the system in actual play, but go a step further and explicitly direct the players to discuss and add in the rest of the equation.  At which point "out of the box" under both (a) and (b) becomes an incredibly murky thing, to the point of incomprehensibility.  The rules direct you to modify the rules -- by doing so, are you following the rules, or changing the rules?  You're doing both.                        </div>

                            I agree with JBR and JDC. And what they and Brand have been saying about the impossibility of playing an RPG completely "out of the box" is exactly what I've been talking about on other threads when I bring up the difficulties of expecting a game with "natural language" (as opposed to formal language) rules regarding procedures and motivations to accurately communicate the designer's intent.<br/><br/>Or, if you find the Lumpley Principle useful, RPGs are problematic when it comes to conveying a complete System via the rules. In most boardgames, by contrast, if you assume that the rules can be mechanically enforced (if necessary through computer moderation), then the only thing needed to complete the System is a common understanding of "winning" and "losing"--strongly ingrained concepts in most cultures.<br/><br/>Getting back to RPGs, DitV for example doesn't "work out of the box" even when it's played "unfudged". It's taking me some work to find an approach to the game that's not only satisfying, but which even guides me at all with regard to how I should make decisions. Do I try to entertain the other players? Have the character do what I would do? Have the character do what I think works best with my vision of the setting and the character's background? Maybe I should just try to blow through the town, engineer my conflicts to maximize my Experience Fallout, minimize the effect of any "bad" fallout, and become a Conflict Monster. I'm pretty sure some of these approaches are "wrong" (or at least they aren't very interesting to me), but I'm not sure I'll find one that's entirely "right", either. I can easily imagine that some people will never find a right answer.<br/><br/>When I move a man in chess, if someone asks me why I made that move, I can always give a general answer in terms of the tactics of the game ("to hold the center", "to threaten the queen", etc.), and if questioned about that, I can relate it in some way to larger objectives that ultimately connect to "in order to win". Even if someone doesn't like chess, they'll understand what they're supposed to try to do with it--win. With RPGs, not only is it possible to dislike a game--it's quite possible that someone will <i>simply not be able to understand</i> what it is that they're supposed to do within the game, and thus be unable to develop any criteria for their actions in the game.                        </div>

                            I am of the view that if we have defined "out of the box" into meaninglessness, that's approximately where it belongs. I just don't see any clear line between drawing up a dungeon in D&amp;D, a town in Dogs, or a zeppelin in Adventure! on the one hand, and making up a house rule about maximum IQ allowed in a GURPS game on the other.  There are so many cases that straddle any line I could conceivably draw, I have to come to the conclusion that there is no line and it's all just in my head and meaningless.                        </div>

I'm still open, empirically, to the idea that an RPG can be "complete", but I haven't seen it yet. My working hypothesis is that not-completeness is really not-getting-it-ness.                        </div>

                            Brand, <br/>
<br/>
bq. Because if you say that Pictionary and Sorcerer are played pretty much the same way, and that one can't judge the differences in investment between them, nor the differences in mode of play and interaction, then we're pretty much just tossing our hands in the air and going "hell, its all the same anyway!"<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm hardly saying that.  But the direction the discussion is taking is that "no game is played out of the box."  In which case, that usage of "out of the box" is pretty pointless.<br/>
<br/>
By analogy: I could critically ask about a game (Sorcerer, say) "Does this game tend to be played out of the box?"  If the usage is "nothing is added," then as a critical analysis tool, it's as useful as "Is this game a set of rules to govern a social interaction?"  <br/>
<br/>
I don't disagree that there's very fruitful territory to be explored in the realm of where does design leave off, and where does a table pick up, and what role should the designer play in making that call.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest that there's different qualities to that call.  There's the difference between explicit "input boxes" (What is Humanity, design the town, Engineer a Situation), a presumption of fudging (GURPS, arguably D&amp;D et al), and the mid-ground of No Myth stuff, and the Burning Wheel suggestive background.<br/>
<br/>
Unrelated and in the same vein is the judgemental crticism of congruency between Game as Conceived, Written and Played.<br/>
<br/>
And all of that's fascinacting, and worthy of designs and critiques that focus on them, but all I'm saying is that "out of the box" as a term is either pretty close to "without fudging rules" or uselessly restates the concept that an RPG pretty much requires that we make an investment in the game.                        </div>

                            JBR,<br/><br/>I would go with (b)We used all of the rules presented in the book without changing anything (but added in our other-stuff rules)--because I think the "adding our own other-stuff" is obvious and goes without saying. It doesn't go without saying all the time. I think there are definitely times when it's important to point out that people playing a game bring their own stuff to the mix. But I don't think it needs to be said <i>every time</i>, and I don't think <i>not</i> saying it means one isn't aware of it.<br/><br/>So, when I said before "I've played RPGs out of the box," yes, I meant, "I used the rules as written and didn't change a thing, and the players all brought their own stuff to the mix." Now, while that kind of thing has been rare in my history of playing RPGs, nowadays I try to make it happen more often than not. Generally by sticking with games where I know the rules as written work, so I won't need to change any in order to play the game.<br/><br/>But I'm not convinced that "bringing our stuff to the mix" is something unique to RPGs. It could very well be, but I haven't seen anything to really sell me on it. I think it sells other games short (and elevates RPGs to a level I'm not comfortable elevating them to) to say that RPGs are games in which the players are invested while in other games the players are just playing the game.                        </div>

I agree with you, too.<br/>
<br/>
How I square that with earlier agreements is: JBR may have been going off on a tangent by emphasizing the "straight out of the box" part, but I agree with what he wrote, as a self-contained rant.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm seeing here is the birth of a very important distinction between "fudging" and "adding necessary ingredients that only the players can provide." I've gotten the impression that this distinction has often been blurred by the catchall term "drift", combined with disagreements over which parts of a game text are "the rules" and which parts are just "guidelines".                        </div>

                            I strongly disagree - I think what we're witnessing here is the death of that (Eliot's) distinction. Over the many centuries, and by centuries I mean years, of gaming, plenty of people have said "Oh, we don't change any of the rules" and even in some cases "No, we play in the standard setting".  Adhering to "canon" is a big deal for a lot of groups, such a big deal that they react to changes in canon that they don't like via new publishing with horror and furious dismay.  After all, they're not here to play some (haughty sniff) homebrew, they're here to play The Game.<br/>
<br/>
I often fell on the other side of the line, feeling that if you weren't playing a homebrew, you were basically just playing around in some dumbass game designer's sandbox and what the hell did he know about our games? Nothing. Not one damn thing.<br/>
<br/>
Now I feel that the distinction is meaningless and unfruitful (although I still know game designers don't know one damn thing about my group, ha ha, your loss, my group is rad.)  Consider a group playing D&amp;D3 with characters they generated in the Forgotten Realms, a group playing D&amp;D3 with characters they generated in a setting they generated, and a group playing D&amp;D3 with some house rules and some characters they generated in a setting they generated.  All three groups are playing D&amp;D3.  Certainly we can draw distinctions between what each group is doing, but what's useful about the distinctions? <br/>
<br/>
I don't think they're useful.  Who cares if one person's contribution to the game is Biff Smackface the dwarven monk and another person's contribution to the game is rolling 3d6 instead of 1d20 and a third person's contribution is that every session, GMing duties pass to the next oldest gaming group member? Do any of these things have anything to do with talking about any quality of D&amp;D3?                        </div>

                            I know about your group, JD.  Haw.  You still MUSH?<br/><br/>I think the distinction Eliott was trying to get at is player input as expected by the published rules -- town creation in Dogs is way more embedded into the expectation of how the game is played than your homebrew Toreador bloodline is embedded in Vampire.                        </div>

                            JD, you said: <br/><code>Who cares if one person's contribution to the game is Biff Smackface the dwarven monk and another person's contribution to the game is rolling 3d6 instead of 1d20 and a third person's contribution is that every session, GMing duties pass to the next oldest gaming group member? Do any of these things have anything to do with talking about any quality of D&amp;D3?</code><br/>When I'm in designer head I'd say: No, yes, maybe -- in that order as an answer to those examples. <br/><br/>(The individual characters created matter only in so far as they follow the rules, the mechanics of the rules however have a huge ripple effect on game systems that can change the mode of play when they are changed, and the rotating GM example would depend on what they are doing with their CRs and such. In D&amp;D it probably matters less, in other games it could matter more. In Rune, for example, it's a killer.) <br/><br/>When I'm in player head I'd say: Yes, maybe, yes -- in that order as an answer to those examples. <br/><br/>(The other PCs in the game are always going to matter to me in terms of this specific game, the rules change is going to depend on what my agenda towards the game is and how it effects my critical strike range, and the rotating GM thing will essentially change the way I approach the game.)<br/><br/>When I'm in GM head I'd say: Yes, Yes, Yes -- in that order as an answer to those examples. <br/><br/>(I only care about the individual game at hand, and the players contributions to it are the most important thing. However, I still have to think about what the others are doing in their GM time, which is different than how I normally play D&amp;D, and how the 3d6 is going to stack with that guys Lightning Reflexes, Improved Trip, Spiked Chain combo.) <br/><br/>So I guess it depends on where I'm sitting at the moment. And since my answers can change based on perspective, I'm guessing that means there are some differences in operation between the sets. I just won't see them all from any one place.                        </div>

I agree with that. Except...there's something in the back of my head saying, "Yes, but..."<br/><br/>But I can't think of what that "but" is. So, I'll just agree for now and let it go.                        </div>

                            First, I should answer Nir's questions.  <br/><br/><i>Do you play games unfudged straight out of the box? </i><br/><br/>Yes.  I used to house-rule more often than not, but these days I will generally play a system exactly as written first, and only introduce house rules after a many sessions of play.  (For example, the first 15 sessions of Buffy we played by the book.  Then in Season Two I introduced house rules.)  <br/><br/><i>What are your views on altering a ready-made system? </i><br/><br/>It's fine.  Pretty much everyone and his brother has their own RPG system that they're designing, and house rules are pretty much an equivalent approach.  <br/><br/><i>Are these views different when it comes to "mainstream" vs. "indie" games (I can imagine someone would be more willing to mess with GURPS then Polaris, or vise versa)?</i><br/><br/>Not for me.  Games is games.  <br/><br/><i>Where's your limit? Which is to mean, how hard will you work to change a system you see potential in rather then just trying something else?</i><br/><br/>None, really.  At some point of modification, it becomes easier to present an edited rules document rather than the original rules and a list of changes.  However, that's mostly a practical matter.  <br/><br/><i>And finally, what are your views on the toolbox analogy?</i><br/><br/>There's room for both toolbox games and more ready-to-play games.  <br/><br/><b>JDCorley</b> wrote:
<blockquote>I am of the view that if we have defined "out of the box" into meaninglessness, that's approximately where it belongs. I just don't see any clear line between drawing up a dungeon in D&amp;D, a town in Dogs, or a zeppelin in Adventure! on the one hand, and making up a house rule about maximum IQ allowed in a GURPS game on the other. There are so many cases that straddle any line I could conceivably draw, I have to come to the conclusion that there is no line and it's all just in my head and meaningless.</blockquote>
While I agree that no RPG is 100% complete, I think that we can distinguish differing levels of completeness.  Some game texts are more complete than others.  <br/><br/>It's not something that's strictly quantifiable, but my measure is to hypothetically hand the game by itself to a random stranger, and check how easy it is for him to play the game.  Some games rely heavily on assumptions.  For example, <i>Fudge</i> and <i>My Life With Master</i> use the term "GM" without ever defining or explaining it.  However, there are a lot of pitfalls in considering completeness.  <br/><br/>Notably, just telling the participants to do a broad task doesn't make a game complete.  For example, saying "Just make up equipment stats as you see fit" doesn't make a game more complete than a game which lists equipment but leaves off waterskins.  And just saying "GM decides" also is technically complete, but is rather passing the buck.                        </div>

Tell me you're playing D&amp;D 3, but hasten to add that you've munged the experience system to give a standard XP reward per session--that tells me something.                        </div>

                            Brand: I like your dichotomy between unfudged and out of the box. I could get behind that as a working definition.<br/><br/>In this context I see "play out of the box" as meaning you don't really have to invest anything creatively to start playing. (Setting up the Jenga tower does not count for investment.) Chargen, worldbuilding, whatever. Interestingly, I've had players who expect to not have to do this creative part, and they are the suck apathetic players. Or... maybe their expectations are valid, and games should cater to them. I hadn't considered it... Hmm.<br/><br/>And enough with that fucking lotus already.                        </div>

                            Larry - my whole group does not want to do any creation other than character creation. That's not what they want, that's not what they're there for. They're there to experience a grand adventure, setting, plot, and all, and they want to be surprised by it, and do cool stuff in it, but create? No. Fuck no. No way. The games I've tried with that sit there like a lump. <br/>
<br/>
They're fantastic players. Absolutely not apathetic. Extremely enthusiastic. But NOT about creating things. "If I wanted to do that," one said cogently, "I'd volunteer to GM."                        </div>

Okay, but the enthusiasm they bring, and the character's they create is an investment.  If you don't believe me, try throwing a My Little Pony plot at a party of barbarians (or whatever.)  They expect the grand adventure to involve their characters, and by extension they're setting constraints on the adventure from the characters they create.<br/>
<br/>
I think there might be something to the Out Of Box idea in terms of defining a role-playing game.  Which, as Game Chef has shown us, is sort of tricky.                        </div>

                            JD, I'll bet your group may not conceive of themselves as being creative, but simply by playing their characters actively, making decisions as if they give a damn, and caring about the outcomes, they're adding something to the game that isn't in the box. For that matter, even if they were a bunch of lumps passively rolling dice when the GM told them to, the game still wouldn't work (I'd guess) if the GM wasn't adding something to the box.<br/>
<br/>
"Out of the box" is definitely relative. Candyland and Chutes &amp; Ladders are among the few games I can think of that play almost completely out of the box, and even they "work" to the extent that the players interpret what happens on the board in terms of themselves, the players, winning or losing. Monopoly &amp; Clue seem to work out of the box, but in fact they do so less than Candyland because the players actually have to make decisions in the game, and furthermore based on compatible criteria--you're probably going to hate being the guy who's trying to win in Monopoly when somebody else is basically in it to put the moves on another player.<br/>
<br/>
Most RPGs are at the far end of non-out-of-the-boxness.                        </div>

                            This thread seems to have gotten bizarre.<br/>
<br/>
There's a difference between using a tool to create something and creating a tool.<br/>
<br/>
If a tool comes broken, I send it back and get a better one. That doesn't address whether or not I use the tool to make something good.<br/>
<br/>
"Fudging" the rules happens because the rules are broken. That's a totally different thing from using the rules to make a story. The rules are a set of procedures that, when followed and used within specification, have a predictable end result. If you don't like the end result, you should play using different rules. Sometimes, that's because there's a bug in the rules that requires a simple fix (PTA's 1st ed. dice rules vs. 2nd ed. card rules), but most of the time it's a systemic problem.<br/>
<br/>
<b>This is unrelated to the creativity of using those rules to make a story.</b> The amount of "creative investment" of a well-tuned rule system can be enormous. You can be in front of your friends laughing, crying, and gritting your teeth in anticipation because of your beautiful story, characters, setting, and chances are, if that's happening, you're either playing the rules out of the box or you're using completely different and new rules that work well (that you might not even be aware of until you sit down and analyze).<br/>
<br/>
If I had to change the rules of Mountain Witch or Dogs in the Vineyard to enjoy the game, I never would have given them a second glance.<br/>

                            I strongly, vehemently, and emphatically deny that rules are only fudged when they are broken. No, no, no, no. Absolutely not. The rule may accomplish exactly what its designer intends it to accomplish, or it may be broken and not accomplish that.<br>
<br>
But fortunately for me, what the designer intended to accomplish is of none, zero, zilch, nada, zippo, no consequence to me whatsoever. I don't care about what they want. Fuck the designers, they know nothing about my game. I care only about what I want. <br>
<br>
If I play D&amp;D without attacks of opportunity, which I have, I am not doing so because the rule is broken, I am doing so because that particular rule is not what I want for that particular game with that particular group. <br>
<br>
Hell! I will go so far as to say that if I "forget, except intentionally" to use an attack of opportunity in a particular scene in a particular game where we are otherwise using that rule, it has nothing to do with its brokenness or any deficiency in the game, the rule, the designer, the book, the publishing company, or the place where I bought it, it has to do with me, me, me, me, me, the glorious and unmatchable center around which my entire gaming universe revolves.<br>
<br>
Designers will never be able to give me anything remotely like the game I want. Why would they? So there's nothing broken about the rules I change, the setting I change. Even the elements I add to a game weren't somehow "left out" by a designer.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
That's a dismal definition. I decline to accept it.<br/>
<br/>
I also decline to decide that it's someone's responsibility to do the impossible. But maybe it's less impossible for designers to write what other people want than it is to write what I want. I'm happy to be an outlier.                        </div>

                            It should be noted, also, that we're not even saying that no one will invent the robot hammer with x-ray laser vision. This is an evolving technology. The argument you're making, JD, is that not only does this scissor-weight work at least as well as a hammer, but that no improvements can be made that are better than putting on more tape.                        </div>

<br/>
That is certainly not what I'm saying.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm saying is that a definition of "broken" that includes every word in every gaming book ever written is not a useful definition.<br/>
<br/>
After all, if just one group, say, mine, decides to change something in a gaming book, whatever our motivation, whatever informs our decision, it doesn't matter, we're doing it because the thing we're changing is broken. That is the definition, yes?<br/>
<br/>
Surely you are not saying that a rule (or whatever) that is "broken" again becomes "sound" (or whatever the opposite of broken is) when we decide to use that rule in a subsequent campaign or session (or moment?)  Or are you saying exactly that? <br/>
<br/>
The rule didn't change, we changed.                        </div>

                            Guys, y'all need to step down from your rhetorical positions, here.<br/><br/>Ben &amp; AC, there's a big difference between inappropriate and broken.<br/><br/>JD, whatever processes you use in an actual game to determine what happens in that game is that game's system.  System does matter.<br/><br/>Not all of your system comes out of a book.  Not everything in a given book is going to be appropriate for every given game.  Designers do not dictate play experiences, players do.  Designers provide content and procedures, but they fundamentally cannot provide all of the content and procedures required to create a game.<br/><br/>If a designer provides a tool that isn't used, that doesn't make the tool broken.  If a player substitutes, drops, adds, or otherwise changes the set of rules presented in the book before implementing the set in the game, that's a fudge.  The player makes most of these decisions based on what they want for their game; sometimes what the player wants out of a game makes a specific provided rule inappropriate to provide that kind of game.  The presented rules are not broken, they're just not appropriate.<br/><br/>Broken means it doesn't do what it's designed to do.  Inappropriate means it doesn't do something that isn't what it's designed to do, which shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.  This isn't about a player strapping a weight to scissors to bang things in.  This is about a player not using the hammer provided when he needs to cut something, and using the scissors out of the junk drawer, instead.<br/><br/>Designers cannot create a totalizing discourse that controls all games played using their rules.  It simply doesn't work that way.<br/><br/>However, that's a far cry from saying that the intent of the designers have no consequence to actual play.  That's crazy talk just as much as expecting designers to have absolute precognition and control over actual play.  The rules that the designer provides influences the game that is created with those tools, whether or not those tools are used without modification or in concert with other tools.                        </div>

                            I agree with JDCorley about the use of the word "broken".  Normal humans don't call a hammer "broken" if it doesn't work well to cut things.  In fact, we tend to call people who say that "stupid".  The fact that people have often modified and adapted Dogs to do new things is a testament to how well the base rules work, not that they are broken.  <br/><br/>There are genuinely broken rules which are modified or ignored even by a game's biggest fans.  I prefer to use "broken" to where it clearly applies -- when using something for its intended purpose and it fails to function.  <br/><br/>Going back to Joshua Newman's comments:  I think there's a very fuzzy line between what is a tool and what is product in a role-playing game, because the tools themselves are part of the game experience -- just as much as the fiction is.  So, for example, <i>Sorcerer</i> asks that you define for yourselves what Humanity is and what calls for checks.  That's not part of the fictional world -- that's part of the rules.                        </div>

                            The hammer is only a broken pair of scissors if it says SCISORS  on the side of it and has a little pamphlet explaining how to use it to cut hair. It's broken at a systemic, design level. It was designed poorly with concussive results.<br/><br/>If you decide not to use SCISORS for your haircutting purposes and use a steak knife instead, things are <i>better</i> but not as good as if you designed something from scratch to cut hair.<br/><br/>Now, providing a rule that doesn't get used means that the designer has taken on the (probably impossible) task of designing a bunch of rules that both work well together and lose nothing by eliminating them.<br/><br/>So, when you decide "This Attack of Opportunity rule doesn't suit us," you're either taking on the task of redesigning tactical combat in D&amp;D, or you're striking out on your own completely, using whatever untested rules your group is coming up with on the fly and based on your relationships, who's hungry, who just took a great bike ride, and all that other stuff that, in game design, is noise. <br/><br/>What's the difference between a product and a tool when the producer produces tools?                        </div>

                            Still working on quoting, so bear with me. I disagree with this:<br/>
<br/>
"Now, providing a rule that doesn't get used means that the designer has taken on the (probably impossible) task of designing a bunch of rules that both work well together and lose nothing by eliminating them."<br/>
<br/>
Who says? Man, the rule might be perfectly damn good, and I still won't use it, possibly because I'm an idiot, possibly because I'm a genius. The rule doesn't change depending on whether idiots or geniuses use or don't use them, surely its brokenness doesn't change either.<br/>
<br/>
What if a designer's created a rule that is easily removable from the ruleset if a particular group wants to remove it? I don't know whether that happens a lot, but it's got to be in someone's mind, sometime...<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure about the product/tool distinction either (I am kind of thinking it is a red herring, like the scissors/hammer thing). But I'm double super not sure about the distinction between "redesigning tactical combat in D&amp;D" and "striking out on our own completely", and why player motivation matters. If we redesign tactical combat, whatever our motivation, are we not striking out on our own? If we say "yeah, this is probably subpar tactical combat design, but we don't want to put a ton of work into it, let's move on!" is this not of a piece with the fellow who has the notebook full of alternative rules? (Is it not of a piece with the guy who refuses to upgrade to 3.5, or who obsessively downloads errata?)  Are not all of these people doing the same thing on some level?<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I'm trying to get at is what you identify as "noise" to the game designer is, to me, the only enjoyable thing about gaming that has ever existed.                        </div>

                            Hi, :)<br/>
<br/>
Dudes disagreeing with JDC, and especially Ben:<br/>
<br/>
There's a game that I like that has a rule that I like. But, alas, I also like playing without the rule. So, I start a campaign with the rule, but I start another without it, and I have a bucketload of fun.<br/>
And before everyone goes all DDWWMDW on me, imagine this story with a horrible mangling involved, like, say, playing Sorcerer without Humanity. Shock and horror, yeah, I know, but imagine it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What you guys seem to be saying is that I am using this "context" thingie to turn the rule into broken and then back to unbroken and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Meh!<br/>
<br/>
I'm with Fred and Jason on this one, in that I so don't buy that definition of "broken".<br/>
<br/>
It's not "the ducks".<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<blockquote>Who says? Man, the rule might be perfectly damn good, and I still won't use it, possibly because I'm an idiot, possibly because I'm a genius. The rule doesn't change depending on whether idiots or geniuses use or don't use them, surely its brokenness doesn't change either.</blockquote>
You're assuming that the rule is doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Joshua BR, I think that rules should be carefully designed. I think that you'll find that, the more carefully you design rules, the more tightly tied together they'll be. When rules aren't tied to other rules, that means they don't effect each other, and that means that you're sort of playing multiple, simultaneous games. I doubt that ever really happens. At the very least, they all effect the fiction.<br/><br/>Attack of Opportunity is a rule that has a single intent (as far as I can tell): limit the players' options by their initial decisions, a design philosophy echoed throughout the game: character creation limits your valid leveling choices, spell memorization limits, even hit points. The who system is designed so that you make choices that have tactical limiting effects later. What you're doing is reducing the input the system has into the game. And you're doing that because you don't like the root of the system; if you liked the "make choices now that limit my options later" philosophy, you'd be embracing it. That sounds kinda broken.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how long I can sustain this conversation. I've been repeatedly eyerolled by designers who have read this thread and told me "good fucking luck." Here's the thing: if you want to design rules that deliberately have little effect on the course of the game, go right ahead. If you want to make up rules without playtest and careful design so that they'll somehow fit your social contract expectations, cool. But that doesn't make it good, thoughtful design. That's stabbing in the dark.                        </div>

                            See, now that just sounds weird. Why is it that the designer's intent in writing the rule matters, but my intent in changing it doesn't? I would think that it would be the other way around. The designer, after all, might have gotten hit by a bus right after he wrote it down and died before he could revise it properly.<br/>
<br/>
I can assure you that when I play D&amp;D without attacks of opportunity, it has nothing whatsoever to do with "not liking the root of the system". In fact, I have played two different campaigns without attacks of opportunity and left them out for two extremely different reasons. But if I am reading you right, it doesn't matter why I left them out, my decision to do so proves that it's "broken"?                        </div>

Your intent in changing it totally matters. It matters much more than the designer's. That's why you should be designing a new game that has the parts you want. You've already started.
<blockquote>In fact, I have played two different campaigns without attacks of opportunity and left them out for two extremely different reasons. But if I am reading you right, it doesn't matter why I left them out, my decision to do so proves that it's "broken"?</blockquote>
You're making the case pretty well yourself, there.<br/><br/>When you leave the rule in, why do you do it? Would the same decision to take it out be well-applied to other parts of the system? Is the only reason you're not doing that because it would take too much work to rewrite the system and then teach it to everyone?<br/><br/>[Edit: DAMMIT.

                            Cool, questions I can answer:<br/>
<br/>
"When you leave the rule in, why do you do it?"<br/>
<br/>
That reason also varies considerably with the campaign I'm designing.  Thinking back, I can give you the example of two very different campaigns where I used that rule for two very different reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 involved mass combat involving a civlization that had kickass spear-using folks. Thus I wanted them to have access to all the rad spear fighting moves involving threatening people who get within reach of their spears and being awesome. No attacks of opportunity, no rad special spear fighting moves.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 involved the PCs as zippy, chandelier-swinging, rapier-waving rogues. I wanted to show oft the fact that they all could tumble and dash about while the big dumb palace guards in their heavy armor trundled by with their pikes.  That doesn't work if everyone can tumble and dash about.<br/>
<br/>
"Would the same decision to take it out be well-applied to other parts of the system?"<br/>
<br/>
Uh...well-applied? What do you mean? Do you mean "did I alter other parts of the rulebook in order to get to the campaign goal I wanted?"  Ummm...sure? I mean, just in the two games above, I put a town in a Forgotten Realms country that didn't exist before, and a dungeon that didn't exist before...I used the alternate XP system in the DMG, I incorporated some awesome feats from another D20 supplement...the players generated their characters and their character's families and hot girlfriends and boyfriends?  I did some other things to get to the campaign I wanted...is what what you mean by 'well-applied'?<br/>
<br/>
"Is the only reason you're not doing that because it would take too much work to rewrite the system and then teach it to everyone?"<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how to answer this.  It doesn't seem to make any sense when applied to how I created these campaigns.  I said "Yeah, D&amp;D swashbucklers, fucking rad, I'll need attacks of opportunity, and cool looking swords, and poofy sleeved shirts, and some town with dopey town guards in it...they'll have pikes...oh, I should use those crazy run up walls feats from that one PDF I bought...acrobatics all over the place, be sure to give people free ranks in Tumble...they should have hot girlfriends and boyfriends to get in trouble with...definitely..." When you say 'would it have been easier to just rewrite the whole thing', I wonder if you mean by hand or if I could use a Xerox machine, because I don't see myself as changing all that much.                        </div>

                            Ah, OK. So you did it because you wanted to validate or invalidate certain tactics. OK.<br/>
<br/>
You see how those changes alter the way D&amp;D works, right?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I can say "I'll take my feats when I need them" too, right? Or "I'll memorize as spell as soon as I need it." Right? They have the same game design effect: moving the point of decision forward to the time when it to the player, making it more tactical.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I see in no way how this is analogous to Town Creation in Dogs. Town Creation is part of playing the game; it has rules and procedure. Creating your own town is using the system as it was designed. Taking out Attacks of Opportunity, spell memorization, and feat choice is outside the rules. There are no rules for doing that, so you're shooting in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn't shooting in the dark, Wizards of the Coast wouldn't bother playtesting stuff.<br/>
<br/>
(I just remembered: spell memorization can be circumvented by playing a Sorcerer, right? But there are built-in tradeoffs. That's how you do that. To change the Attacks of Opportunity rules, you need to devise similar tradeoffs.)                        </div>

                            Of course my changes alter "how D&amp;D works". So does making up a dungeon and staffing it with monsters versus making up a town and staffing it with evil cultist conspirators. If "D&amp;D works" at all, it has to be working differently when the play experiences are so very different.<br/>
<br/>
Making up a town "about" sexual transgression in Dogs changes "how Dogs works" from the way it works when the group makes up a town "about" patriarchy and prejudice.  If it doesn't, what's the point of having the rules to bring different issues to the fore? If every town "works" the same as every other town, why generate different towns?                        </div>

Hmmmmno. JD, you lost me there.<br/>
<br/>
Driving in the city at rush hour is a necessarily different experience than rally-like driving in a country road. But the car works the same. On the other hand, if you take out the engine and replace it with solar panels, you changed the way the car works.<br/>
<br/>
So, I can derive different experiences from stuff without changing how that stuff works. But changing rules is a more in depth alteration than simply setting up different situations.<br/>

First of all, there is no clear difference between rules and situation -- since rules can govern what the situation is and/or how you generate it.  Similarly, rules can specify setting and character.  <br/><br/>I also disagree that resolution is inherently deeper than situation.  For example, consider chess with a different starting setup with no rooks, bishops or knights -- only pawns, knights, and kings.  You can change a game pretty radically by altering the situation.                        </div>

Of course, John. System Does Matter, after all, so it's a non-issue to say:<br/>
Altering System =&gt; Altering Situation<br/>
<br/>
What I was saying, though, is that:<br/>
Altering Situation =<b>/</b>&gt; Altering System<br/>

                            Joao, I think you need to reconsider that a bit.  If you take your party of D&amp;D Dungeoneers and stick them in a court politics &amp; intrigue situation, you're going to either be (a) accessing wildly different parts of the system and doing so in different ways or (b) using the system in ways that doesn't really support that situation (treating the castle as a dungeoncrawl).  Changing the situation most assuredly does change the system <em>that gets used</em>, which is the only system worth talking about in this context.                        </div>

                            Hi, :)<br>
<br>
I'm sorry. How is accessing different parts of the system, even if in different ways, changing the system? Are we not loosing the trees for the forest or something here?<br>
<br>
To (over)extend my metaphor, when I'm parking, I use the reverse gear and the rear view mirrors in a wildly different way than when I'm driving, but I still haven't changed how the car works.<br>
<br>
I agree that your (b) is changing the system, but not your (a).<br>
<br>
Well, that's not true. I agree that all of it is "changing the system that gets used". But that's not what the thread is about. You can take your party of D&amp;D Dungeoneers and stick them in a court politics &amp; intrigue situation, and you can do it with D&amp;D out of the box. In other words, you can "change system" and stil be playing out of the box, thus addressing Jason's last post, which is what I was aiming at.<br>
<br/>
Taking the party to the court is not the same as taking out attacks of opportunity, is what I'm saying.<br/>
<br/>

                            I just plowed through this entire thread, so pardon me if I'm repeating something other people have said and I somehow missed, but . . .<br/><br/>It seems like there's a significant group of people here who are arguing that  taking a rule out of a game (say, attacks of opportunity out of D&amp;D) is somehow a bad thing, because it makes the system unbalanced.  Or perhaps the system was already broken, because there arose a situation in which I wanted to remove a rule.  Or something.<br/><br/>I think there's one fundamental assumption here, though, that at the very least isn't true for me.  Who says I want to play in a mechanically sound system?  I'll take exactly as much system as I need in order to make a great story and keep my group happy, and not one rule more or less.  I don't care if this makes things mechanically unsound, because I'm perfectly willing to handle those imbalances through social consensus or through narrative reasoning.<br/><br/>As a GM, I generally want system for exactly two things: inspiring and guiding me to make a story, and resolving conflicts when I can't handle them narratively.  Lots of designers want to design rules that do much more than that.  To me, <i>those</i> rules are broken, even if they're really excellently designed and tied into the core of the narrative and etcetera etcetera.  I'd rather see the rules, understand how they function, and then make an informed decision about whether they make sense for me, or whether I'm going to use some variant, or ignore them, or what.<br/><br/>Those are design decisions, too, and my ability to make those decisions (and my desire to do so) has to do with my own nature as a GM and the demands of my group, my story and my mood.  I've 'broken' every single game I've played, from D&amp;D to Polaris - and that's because no one designs games specifically for me. <br/><br/>So really what I need is a full-time game designer on my personal staff . . . <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

That's fine Jess, but, do you do the same with card games? Board games? Sports? If so, then I'll shut up, now, but if not, then why not? I mean, they weren't designed specifically for you either. :)<br/>

                            Hey guys, I just got back and noticed that this thread is still going on, and a lot of people are still talking past each other.<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest taking a 24 hour break, and:<br/>
<br/>
1) Moving the minutiae of "What is Out of the Box?" to the blogverse to chew on (it's hard to chew on here while the very definition doesn't have consensus and is in debate), and<br/>
<br/>
2) Posting no more to this thread WITHOUT the use of solid examples.  I'm talking Game Names (spell them right out) so that people understand: <b>D&amp;D doesn't count, because it's too loaded to be meaningful here in this thread</b>.  Use anything else though.<br/>
