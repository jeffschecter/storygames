Why did I take this job, and why I take it home with me?  I wish they still paid for those swanky downtown offices, instead of this industrial blah. Ah well.<br/><br/>What I think of as "The Chilean robot" is, as far as I can tell, an AI chatbot of some kind.  It sometimes spouts nonsense, sometimes asks questions but doesn't seem to change based on the answers (except on its birthday).  My job is to keep altering a kind of Zork-like chat environment for it to talk to.  If it slips - basically, if the robot gets bored or thinks it's investigated all the options - I get notifications about various layers of containment breaking down.  I don't know why they call it "containment" - and when I ask, I'm told that it's classified.  I've never seen higher than Containment 5 breach - that's how things were before I came in, when they were offering $100k a year for a "creative programmer".  <br/><br/>Whatever, it's better than stealing bikes.<br/><br/>I keep thinking about my game - what I feed the 'robot' so it stays 'contained'.  It goes through major upgrades every 687 days.  Weird, right?  That's coming up next week.  I'm wondering how it will react when I say "Happy Birthday, Robot!"  Heh, I'll have to add that to the game.  <br/><br/>I flip that e-mail home, with that idea.  <br/><br/>I wish the server farm with the bot were here, instead of someplace in Chile.  Why did it have to be Chile?  They say the server farm is cheap there.  I'm surprised we don't see more downtime.  It's almost a self-fullfilling prophecy when I see something pop into my inbox.
