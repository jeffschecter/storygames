Once upon a time I would have just had people make up characters and see what happens but I'm beginning to think that's a bad idea. It seems like some sort of idea of what we'd like to do with the game ("Cavemen superheroes defending humanity from a superintelligent race of dinosaurs!") would be a good way to start.<br/><br/>Any advice?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188028/#Comment_188028" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T07:28:58+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  7:28AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that some general sense of "What's the comic book generally meant to be about?" will help to avoid ... well ... comics like the 1980s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing you can do (depending on your group) is to suggest that people can make up their own sets of characters to share with the group.  Like, when we were playing, Sydney wanted a race of lizard people, so he made up all sorts of templates and characters ... a leader of the lizard people, and brontosaur-riding cavalry, and their priest-class, and all that ... and then we'd pick out characters from there as the scene warranted.  Having a large pool as a resource encouraged us to play to that group, and helped us stay on the same page with Sydney about what kind of thing (generally) they should be in the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188049/#Comment_188049" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T08:33:27+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  8:33AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emphasize what kind of feel you want for your game. Do you wish for it to be heroic like out of the silver or golden age, or would you rather have it dark and muddled, where the heroes might be barely considered as such? Ask that the players fit that line. Of the few supers games I've played in, most of the characters would play more like a D&amp;D party than a heroic Superteam with a motivation to go out and smash evil. They should all have some sort of basic inclination to get in a suit to do vigilante work.<br><br>A thought would be to create a "Series Description" like one would find in the first page of a comic to get new readers up to speed and give that to the players aloud. Then instead of just having the players say "Well, this guy has gadgets and kung fu", have them also explain how the other players should view him from the beginning "He's the moral support guy, gives good plans and doesn't brood alot." or "He's kind of shifty, like a Hollywood Agent. He shows up to fight, and he's really good at that, but he always tends to break mission parameters to showboat"<br/><br/>if you choose not to do a "Beginning Episode" where everyone signs up, you can have players tell stories about a interesting thing that another character did that yours saw. "Wombatman and I saved people from a burning building one time, but while I was helping a kid out to safety, he discovered that we walked right into a trap. All the people were androids made by Prof. Destructo and he saved my hide."<br/><br/>If you want, having players have a hand in making a few villians might be fun.<br/><br/>Lastly, figure out the basics of the world- How is it different from ours? How does the legal system view capes and are there statutes that protect certain uses? How many people have powers? How does the normal person consider supers? etc etc.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188177/#Comment_188177" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T17:36:58+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  5:36PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wirebrain</cite>If you want, having players have a hand in making a few villians might be fun.</blockquote>\nThis is a bit confusing: who else would make the villains?<br/><br/>In my experience I have (perhaps somewhat strangely) found the Comics Code to be a bit of a sticking point -- maybe because we have never ended up with a setting that can just use the book example straight-up. But since Gloating seems so integral to the game's complex sort of Awesome, there's often a fair bit of spinning around what should and should not end up in the Comics Code. I'm not sure that a perfect Comics Code is really essential, but a good one is definitely a major step up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188228/#Comment_188228" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T06:23:53+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  6:23AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A thing to remember about the Comics Code.<br/><br/>If you don't want something to even make it by inference into the game, don't put it in the Comics Code.  This is because players are awarded for pursuing something that is in the Comics Code really hard.  They can't ever actually get it but they do get to Gloat (which has real, mechanical benefits) if they are successful.  Putting something in the Comics Code is almost a guarantee that it will show up at least as a goal in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188249/#Comment_188249" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T09:06:48+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  9:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe just get "Capes: Invasion from Earth Prime".

But basically, other than just discussing the tone, style and subject matter beforehand, it seems the trick is (for you and/or your group) to come up with a stable of thematically appropriate characters and make sure that they're bound up in a web of Exemplar relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188495/#Comment_188495" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T12:26:06+00:00" title="January 15, 2009 12:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you use the <i>Spirit of the Centure</i> method to create a group of characters?<br/><br/>You know, make up a few comic books they've appeared in together.

Adapting the Burning template, mostly as it appeared in The Blossoms Are Falling.  Start off with some big questions to nail down scope and setting details. Then get more specific with setting locations and recent (or concurrent) events, ending with the main characters (the stars of the comic book and their nemeses).  Things like major locations (Metropolis? Genosha? Hell's Kitchen?) and genre conventions (are their diety super heroes? Is every superhero a mutant? Are their alien empires involved in secret invasions?) and the important mortal characters.  And for Capes specifically, working out the Comic Code. You don't need every conceveable location or character, but a starting place, a sampling. It's not just the foundation for the first game or so, but also indicators for what people are interested in (locations like Hell's Kitchen and Compton instead of Atlantis and Moon Base Gamma are good flags for interest and style of stories to pursue).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188499/#Comment_188499" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T12:49:58+00:00" title="January 15, 2009 12:49PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My advice is to absolutely decide what kind of tone and atmosphere are acceptable and how that tone and atmosphere impacts the selection of characters people build.<br/><br/>Here's the next bit of advice that might seem odd: GM the game.<br/><br/>You don't need to change any rules but if your sort of leading the game (especially if you're playing with people who haven't played it before) keep an eye toward adversity.  Take the opening scene and play a villain (or his minions) or anything creating a crisis.  In the next scene you will go *last* in choosing characters so watch carefully what the other players choose, if no one is clearly bringing adversity to whatever the player setup, bring it yourself.  Do that in every scene.  If by the time your turn comes around no one has brought in an adversary take it upon yourself to do so.<br/><br/>Eventually other people will catch on to what you are doing and start doing it themselves.  The goal is to have EVERYONE doing this but when you're learning someone needs to know this and do it every scene, otherwise it won't work.  So, seriously, GM the game.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
