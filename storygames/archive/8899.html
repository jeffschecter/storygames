It would involve wanderers whose stories sometimes intersect. I'm not sure whether I'll end up writing it or not, but one thing I thought of for it was that I would like to have a resolution mechanic based on this dice game:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho-han_bakuchi<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not been able to think of a way to make this work, to make the chances of success (or whatever) change based on situation, while maintaining the flavor of the dice game. I probably will not actually end up using it in this game, if I write it. But, now I'm curious, how would you turn this dice game into a resolution mechanic?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196710/#Comment_196710" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T16:10:51+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  4:10PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would think something like this<br/><br/>The Dice can either be Cho or Han that is Odd or Even<br/><br/>The Players can either call Odd or Even, their wager is thier action. <br/><br/>Those who 'Win' Ie Call Odd when it is infact odd or call even when it is infact even get their goals. Winners get their goal unless two or more winner's are in opposition, either may choose to abandon their wager. If the opposition cannot be cleared both winners fail. <br/><br/>Those who loose, Ie Call Odd when it is even or vice versa, do not get their goals unless everyone who looses agrees to let everyone who lost get their goal. <br/><br/>This is roughly cribbed from KPFS which the book says is stolen from some place else, in the grand cycle of stealingness. <br/><br/>If you want to put a wager with currency in this it would work well, but someone else will have to get the details. Perhaps tokens that allow you to act outside of the Cho/han idea.  <br/><br/>Hope that helps, essentially cho han is a d2,,,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196714/#Comment_196714" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T16:44:04+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  4:44PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2009 4:46PM by Bill_White.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about this: <br/><br/>Every player gets a d6. Each player declares an intention; his or her character's goal for the round. Then everybody rolls. If it's odd (han), you get what you want; if it's even (cho), you don't. But you can opt to block or aid another player by foregoing your intention and adding your die to theirs--so you can use your han to make someone else's han a cho, or someone else's cho a han. But narration rights go the player with the highest die in the mix--so if your die is a 6 (a cho), you can be pretty sure you're going to narrate, even if you know you're not going to get your intention.<br/><br/>And there's nothing that says a third or even fourth die can't be added in to any given character's action. All that matters is the highest die and whether it's odd or even. Possibly the sum of the dice could be used for something as well.<br/><br/>That's the basic gist; you can then add in special powers that let you split your die (so that you could turn that 6 into two 3's, for instance), "protect" your roll (so that no one can add their die to yours after you've declared your move), and so forth.<br/><br/>It might have a neat kind of feel to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196722/#Comment_196722" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T17:14:12+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  5:14PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2009 5:20PM by Jarvis.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually had the exact same thought a while back. I love the idea of mechanics that actually add to the setting or theme of the game. The poker aspects of Deadlands or Dust Devils are a prime example.<br/><br/>As for incorporating Cho-Han...<br/><br/>The easy answer would be the correct guesser wins the conflict. Perhaps the character with the stronger ability chooses whether to guess first or second?<br/><br/>Let's try complicating things a little more. Perhaps each character has a few 'attributes' like Mental and Physical or whatever. In a physical conflict, the characters pit their Physical scores against each other. The dice are thrown, players guess odd or even, one player wins. The losing player then has a chance to check off a 'level' of his Physical trait to call for a rematch. Process is then repeated.<br/><br/>Doing it this way, my character might have Physical 3 and Social 1 (or Honor 5 and Piety 2 or whatever) with each 'point' in the attribute allowing me a rematch once per session. The game then involves lucky guesses and choosing what's worth a rematch and what isn't.<br/><br/>What do you think of that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HerpestesFantasticus" title="HerpestesFantasticus"><img alt="HerpestesFantasticus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HerpestesFantasticus">HerpestesFantasticus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196724/#Comment_196724" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T17:43:40+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  5:43PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, I really like your idea, and it almost makes me want to use it. Maybe not in a game about wandering martial artists, but maybe in a game about edo period organized crime. The GM would have to get some tatoos and be shirtless, the players would sit around on tatami mats, and each player would have a different colored die that he would pass to the GM to put in a cup.<br/>\n<br/>\nJarvis, yeah, I know, I like the mechanics to add to the theme and mood as well. It's why I use wooden dice for Mouse Guard. The first idea I don't think would work, because there is no odds difference between cho and han. maybe if you had a different kind of success depending on if you won with cho or han? Or if you used fudge dice, there would be a 2 in 3 chance of even and a 1 in 3 chance of odd. The second idea is basically what Mind's Eye Theatre used to use, isn't it? I don't think it would work, though, because it would bog down too much, I've heard it bogged down with RPS, let alone Cho-han. (and unless you did the whole "the dice are going in" "call your bets" thing, it wouldn't really help the mood, I don't think.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196728/#Comment_196728" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T19:03:20+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  7:03PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not too big into gimmicky resolution mechanics to drive an entire game that much anymore, but I'd definitely see it as a side-item.<br/><br/>I know that when I roll dice as a GM in Tenra, sometimes I do a routine (because I normally roll with a die cup) that involves the whole "hold both hands up, throw the dice in and slam the cup down" thing.<br/><br/>Here's a link to a sequence of what cho-han looks like without hands (dice, calls, betting sticks):<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxukJA7cfrU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxukJA7cfrU</a><br/><br/>Also, in just about every Zatoichi movie there's a cho-han sequence, usually involving Zatoichi fucking people up.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjsWR5HT5wI" rel="nofollow">like this</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlqelHFP-6Y&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">or this,</a> where Ichi basically tricks a bunch of people into thinking that he rolled the dice in the open, when in reality they're actually under the cup... he actually uses this trick in a few movies (where he lectures the people for taking advantage of their blindness, then fucking them up)... but in this case, the trick backfires, because the dice under the cup rolled exactly as the fake pair did, so he loses all his cash.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_RXZaIuk4g" rel="nofollow">or this,</a> where a cho-han sequence turns into a sword-draw battle: "Whomever splits this coin wins".<br/><br/>Anyway, an important thing about the cho-han is, well, the gamble. You have those gambling sticks (trade your money in for sticks on the way in, trade it back on the way out; that way you're not Officially breaking government rules on gambling with money: "We were just playing with sticks!"). Honestly, the chip mechanic in Shab al-Hiri Roach is actually kinda similar to the feel of group betting in cho-han.<br/><br/>In any case, I might do something in a game like "Bringing down the Cho-Han", where the player "cashes out" some resource ("social pool", "combat pool", etc) and gets it back in sticks. The GM gets a number of sticks, too, for the NPC. Another player makes the dice rolls, the GM/player bets (others can join in if they cash in a resource). Each round, the players describe how their wins or losses in-game ("He came back with a retort and floored my argument, crap!"). Eventually, the player can decide when to walk away: Either winning all, losing all, or anywhere in between (the conflict is over, and the pool is adjusted by that amount). The player can also go into debt at "the house", but he basically becomes the bitch of the house, a total slave (this happens a lot in samurai dramas; in fact, Zatoichi gets attacked quite a bit by samurai who were indebted to a gambling house and were told to kill Ichi to clear their debts). I'm not sure how that would work out ruleswise, maybe the GM can simply force the player to jump into situations or do things that they normally wouldn't do, one "thing" per point of debt they owe, or simply say "I clear your debt if you do X" (where X is a really heinous act, or something that screws the other players): The player cannot negotiate back, though: GM either says "You must do X, I will clear you one point of debt" and the player does it, or "You must do X, and in return I will clear all your debt" and the player does it.  Returning the debt to "0" also returns the player's pool in whatever was rolled to its original amount as well.<br/><br/>Frex: If we were playing WoD and someone "brought down the Cho-Han" in a social situation, and the player had Manipulation of 4 and a Persuasion of 3, I'd give them 7 sticks for betting. Their NPC opponent (who I decided had Manupulation 5 Persuasion 4) gets 9 sticks. <br/>After a few rounds, the PC is down to 4 sticks, and decides to bow out while he still has a chance. Too bad, he loses the conflict. He has to readjust his Persuasion/Manipulation for the entirety of the rest of that game so that they are 4 dots total: 2 Persuasion, 2 Manipulation etc.<br/>If the PC was up a few rounds, got up to like 11, and decided to end it there, then they rock out: 11 points to split up between Persuasion and Manipulation for the rest of that session.<br/><br/>I'd also say 9for the sake of time) that you can only do this like once per session, per character.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
