Show off the system but don't be too ambitious. Take Dungeon World - part of the fun is making dudes, which takes 20 minutes, so do that and give some backstory at the same time. Then have a simple adventure prepped - mine was basically four rooms, three encounters, with some wiggle room on either end. <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/dungeon_world/dungeon_world_demo_morningstar.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here are my notes</a>. For DW you want to show them character generation, how moves work, what leveling up feels like and what the iconic bits for each class feel like. 1-2-3 done. Obviously it is a one shot so shower them with cool stuff and accelerate leveling.<br/><br/>I think this advice can be applied to any game that normally takes longer - identify the important and cool bits, and find ways to highlight that stuff reliably while multi-tasking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338242/#Comment_338242" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T10:05:52+00:00" title="August 11, 2011 10:05AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some games (like Action Castle) I'm not sure how you'd take two hours to play through, much less four.

Fr'ex, Morgan Ellis was prepared to run a four hour game on Sunday, but at least one of the players couldn't stay that long. So, the game ran about two and a half hours. I can see how it would have run in a four hour slot, and that would have been fine. But, the two and a half hour version was also good. It's the sort of game where some scenes can be cut or not, and either way, the game will be fine. I'm not quite sure how to describe writing a game that can go two or four hours beyond "Make it modular. Use the bits you absolutely need, and use the others if there's time and it makes sense."<br/><br/>I mean, you might think if the game could run in two hours, that the rest would be padding, or if the game works at four hours, there's nothing to cut for a two hour run. But, this doesn't seem to be the case.<br/><br/>One of my four hour games, a Laundry game I genericed into, ran two, maybe two and a half hours. The GM only took one ticket from me (if it had run the full four hours, he would have taken two, and he stated at the beginning that he expected it to run short), and on pondering, I decided that if I'd been someone buying the ticket in advance, I would have been fine with that. The event ticket guarantees a spot if you show and the game goes off.<br/><br/>I like Official Slots of four hours, and I don't mind if the game runs short so long as it's the right length -- long enough to cover the essentials, short enough to be interesting. For something like Apocalypse World or Burning Empires, you're going to have to pick what you showcase carefully, as you can't run a full game. I could see a sequence of two hour games, each going on to the next step, allowing people to play continuously or not, as they see fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338274/#Comment_338274" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T12:01:32+00:00" title="August 11, 2011 12:01PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For games of the "go out into the world and have adventure encounters" variety (Mouse Guard, Trail of Cthulhu, Apocalypse World, Dogs in the Vineyard, D&amp;D, etc), you build towards a single big encounter, and you build as simply as possible.<br/><br/>Beginning: They already know what they want, but they just need to figure out how to get there.<br/>Middle: Something complicates matters, and damages their resources.

Let's just assume you did some awesome stuff to get to this point.  I really like that GM questioning, player declaration element of a lot of story games.  This sort of start is a prime way to highlight it, by giving some fairly clear questions to ask and answer open-endedly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338508/#Comment_338508" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T16:53:46+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  4:53PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I do "Indie by Storm" (6 games in 4 hours), I carefully set expectations that the pace will be insane, that we will only touch on each game (for 30-35 minutes), and that they will be left wanting more (and here's where they can buy these games).<br/><br/>Next to that, two hours for one game feels positively luxurious. Just do half as much stuff as you would in a four hour game. <br/><br/>Also, prep lots. If chargens are appropriate, make them. Make short summaries of game procedures for the players so they can follow along and don't get stuck on the rules. Avoid the painful 30-minute chat session at the beginning of the slot: that's one-fourth of a 2-hour slot!
