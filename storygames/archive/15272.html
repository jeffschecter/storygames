This is something I'm very interested in, particularly the "do the designers get all the money, or are there ever any issues on that front?" (like, say, Amazon gives you the cash minus the Kickstarter cut, then a donator somehow revokes their payment - is that even a possible scenario, for example?)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not the kind of guy who requires constant massaging and probing after a kickstarter. I imagine like the above that "they're working on it". I don't want or need constant weekly updates or anything. But at the very least, I'm thinking that maybe one update a month would be good, to show that the project hasn't been kicked to the curb, forgotten, etc.<br/><br/>* One project I helped fund because it looked like it was almost complete (or at least on its last spate): All of the art, writing etc appeared done, and just the production was left, plus the future talk of media creation later. I was kinda surprised when after it was funded, I received an update saying basically that work had just begun on the project after funding. It was kind of a disconnect, and one that wasn't spelled out clearly (or obfuscated) in the project description. They've been regular with updates, so it'll happen, but the stage of the project was not clearly conveyed.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I think most projects I funded with the intention of them succeeding (see below) were completed or are on their way. Some had a few expected but pretty well announced printing hangups (Amaranthine; PDF was available *shockingly* fast, though).<br/><br/>** On a few projects, I "donated" a few bucks to them even though it was clear that the project was doomed: A $5000 and a $5500 RPG project, both which were kind of unclear on details, but had a true kernel of something interesting (sort of like a poorly formed First Forge Post). I seeded them like 5-10 to say, "Hey, looks interesting, but now it's time to get your shit together". One is ending with $91 in the bank (12 days to do: If it breaks $200 on its road to $5500 I'll eat a bar of soap) the other $110. <br/><br/>Anyway, interesting thread. Will keep an eye on it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346973/#Comment_346973" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T10:01:07+00:00" title="October 26, 2011 10:01AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I can tell, you can only revoke payment up till the deadline for the project, not after. Also, Amazon does the work of following up with people who's payments don't go through immediatly (due to expired cards or whatever), and shows the project creator who they're still waiting on, but I don't know what happens if there's still an outstanding payment after the time that Amazon holds your money for anyway closes.<br/><br/>Fulfillment is all up to the creator, but Kickstarter has a great questionnaire interface for getting peoples info.

If I like the project and fund it I expect it to get to me whenever it's ready. <br/>Kickstarter is not the place to have your 'impulse' buy achieved.<br/>If the pdf is ready when the Kickstarter starts that is pure gravy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347012/#Comment_347012" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T17:44:49+00:00" title="October 26, 2011  5:44PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe its just me, but when I like knowing that my money helped make the project possible or make the project even more awesome (rather than it just being a pre-order).  If the project is already at the .pdf stage, some good stretch rewards would let backers know that their money can still enable the project to be even better.   Maybe if there's enough money from backers you print hardback or include some full color interior art or maybe everyone gets a bonus supplement.

Technoir, likewise, was ready when it was funded. I prefer this as a backer.<br/><br/>60 Terrible Character Portraits was awful, although they came through eventually. It took a lot of prodding, however. Worldbreakers is missing deadlines, being non-communicative, and otherwise showing signs of failing.<br/><br/>Eldritch Skies is in theory on schedule, although there are rumblings of schedule slip. Hadean Lands, an interactive fiction project, is not looking so good. <br/><br/>I also funded Far West, but GMS isn't behind schedule yet. <br/><br/>Graham Walmsley had Stealing Cthulhu ready by the end of his IndieGoGo project. Pelgrane got the GUMSHOE character generator done.<br/><br/>In general, if there's not an established company or a finished product, I assume Kickstarters have a good chance of producing nothing. It appears to be fairly tough for most people to hold themselves to a deadline when the money isn't riding on it. The original street performer protocol assumed the product would be done when the hat was passed, and it's worked very well for Stolze. The bonus I get when I fund one of his is the knowledge that it'll be released for everyone, which satisfies my altruist bent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347041/#Comment_347041" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-27T07:33:31+00:00" title="October 27, 2011  7:33AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am backing the Robotic edition of Huckleberry Finn.

I can't remember a bad experience, though my tolerance for slow delivery is apparently much higher than some people's. The only real problem I have with it is that around 98% of the updates I get are completely useless to me. I actually wish that number was 100%, because then I could e-mail filter them out of my perception. But 2% of the updates contain things like URLs to the final product and so on, so I can't do that.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, if you are sending an update more than once a month, you are talking to me too much. I care about final delivery and, occasionally, reference to events/projects related to the one I backed, but not much else. I don't care about your problems with your printer. I don't care that you found a better deal by shopping around. I don't care how close you are to being backed or how many days you have left. I don't care that you are looking at proofs. It's about 12:7 against me caring about a sample of art you just got in.<br/><br/>Some numbers: the archive of activity shows just over 940 items and another 30 or so messages, an average of about 9.1 updates per project.

I expect that's because the cool excitement of adding new bonuses ad hoc when new funding levels are set gets ahead of the logistics of fulfilling said bonuses.<br/><br/>Most of the gaming projects I funded included PDFs (at least betas are very near final) well before the final product, including print and play components for two of the 3 board games.  <br/><br/>1 documentary movie project may never deliver...that's not a big deal to me.  I'll miss not getting to see the film, but I've thrown away more money on meals that I wound up worse off for having eaten, so...it's all relative.<br/><br/>1 game project creator was so disappointed in the quality of the initial proofs that he got back while the project was funding that he canceled the kick starter before it was closed until he could find the manufacturer who could do it right, then he started a new kick starter.  Noble, but probably overkill.  I guess he was worried at not being able to find a manufacturer at all.<br/><br/>1 project I'd starrred for future consideration wound up getting yanked by the creator before I contributed.  The comments suspect the project was fraudulent and when funding went way beyond target into the realm of Grand Theft felony he pulled it before actually absconding with the funds.<br/><br/>I do wish kick starter would put in a two tier communication model where I could subscribe to receive just the urgent stuff (like "hey we need your shipping address) and not the "hey here's me yapping about stuff" updates.  I like the yapping updates but I much prefer the forum check-in-when-want mode vs. the old email group blast mode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
