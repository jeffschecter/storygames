It's not <em>deliberately</em> killing the other characters. In my game, no-one got killed (the 5e encounter calculator kinda sucks).<br/>Examples in my game included shouting out curiously into a gaping dungeon maw (which awoke some surprisingly tame bats) and recklessly pursuing a rivalry with an old friend from school, trying to steal from her. The bats could've been a TPK but they ended up an easy fight.<br/><br/>On the German blogs, it seems that people were getting angry as soon as the words "I get scared" were uttered. They were there for a tactical fight, and that's it. In a horror game! (I read one CoC example, one McWoD example.)<br/><br/>In a WFRP 3 game I played in a few years ago, we had a bunch of flashlight-droppers too (including me), and one player (new to the group) was shocked by this. He was like: "What are you doooiingGGGGG?!?!". But in that game we had the support of the dice; we got setbacks and stuff on the dice and we translated those setbacks into various emotional missteps. We changed our IIEE proceedings to fit those funky dice, so we would announce intented effect, roll, then describe the execution and specific actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443195/#Comment_443195" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T17:47:54+00:00" title="February 24, 2015  5:47PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that sounds better.

It seems to defeat the purpose of having clashing "ideals" if everyone plays nice with each other anyway. (Note: I think "Ideals" is a terrible word for this sort of behavior. No one's "ideal" is running away in terror.  Except maybe Rincewind.)  <br/><br/>But I'd probably bow out of playing this sort of game in a "traditional D&amp;D game" setting. Why would my character even be going on an adventure with people he can't trust not to freak out and run away?  I just doesn't make any sense to me.  If you're going to put your life on the line, you're not going to select 4 other random individuals from the "Adventurer's guild" to do it with.  And, let's face it, if I survived this sort of situation, I wouldn't EVER do anything with that character again, so it pretty much ruins the game whether I die or not.  In my experience the idea the "Adventuring party" breaks down very rapidly once you start introducing reasons for the characters to not trust each other.<br/><br/>If you want to run a game with conflicting character ideals, I suggest one that doesn't focus on adventuring party-based play.

And while BW is <i>about</i> the beliefs, as in "the wheel revolves on them", they're absolutely a part of 5e. Unlike BW, they're an elidable part, but they're in the mix by default.\n<blockquote>5E is not like that. And if you think 5E combat is super lethal, I think I'm done with this conversation, because clearly we're not even on the same basic page.</blockquote>\nWait a minute here. Before I get back to the subject of 5e's lethality\u2026 you seem upset. I take that as a sign that I need to take a step back: yes, social contract is super important. Yes, if you as players agree that you should give your all to "succeed with the mission", you should honor that agreement. Yes, if you're uncomfortable with another character's flaw (there are a couple that have addictions, which I know can be a trigger) it can be difficult to speak up. If you think we are disagreeing about something primal, basic and human decency\u2026 please attribute at least some of that to miscommunication rather than malice. Chances are we probably do agree, once we've became clear about the circumstances.<br/><br/>Remember also that it's already established in the sandbox thread that you and I do have a CA clash, or, at the very least, a clash in "technical agenda". I don't mean that as a personal insult. All I'm trying to do is discover what has lead to, and will lead to, awesome play at <i>my</i> table. And I try run a game such that all techniques are in the open. Some are up for discussion, some aren't, but the players know how the game works. There's no DM's screen. I'm trying my best to do this safely and responsibly.<br/><br/>Now, with that said, back to the thread.<br/>It's been my experience that 5e is very lethal. We've only had nine characters die the last six months, but that's because the players are learning to have their characters run, close doors or bribe the enemy. I don't have a lot of 3e/4e-experience (played it once, read most of it though) but I've played a lot of B/X.<br/><br/>It's also a fact that the 5e text, even the basic rules, encourages players to play to their traits, ideals, bonds and flaws, and encourage DMs to reward that.

"Cowardly" behaviour is sneered at.<br/><br/>* Conversely, in another group operating with a different hardcore Gamist agenda (do everything in your power to survive and win), continuing a fight which you aren't sure you can win is considered bad form. In this group, any risky behaviour is evidence that you are not playing "optimally", and therefore failing. ("We win this game by making sure the GM never makes us roll the dice at all!")<br/><br/>* They are playing a combat-oriented game like D&amp;D 4E to tell a story about young adventurers becoming great heroes and overthrowing an ancient evil which threatens the world. The GM guides them from one combat to another as they progress through a fantasy epic. The game supports their Right to Dream agenda, because it's balanced so that the characters are able to overcome pretty much every encounter. In this game, dropping the flashlight would be so contrary to the CA that it would be an instant game-stopper. ("Heroes don't run! Are you a hero or not?" "The GM spent three hours preparing this set-piece... if you run away, we've got nothing to play tonight!")<br/><br/>* They are playing a game about the value of honour, courage, and resilience in the face of greater evil. The characters are all different takes on what drives a person towards self-sacrifice, and they are all excited to explore what happens to such people (the characters are people like Rob Roy, Joan of Arc, and Malcolm X). In this game, dropping the flashlight could be a really cool statement about your character, or it could be a total game-breaker, if we were all playing with the assumption that this would essentially disqualify your character from being a protagonist in this kind of story.<br/><br/>(Note that the last example could still be a Gamist game, if the point of play was to portray your character <i>better</i> or come up with wilder self-sacrifical, heroic behaviour than your peers, trying to one-up each other every night. It's really hard to say unless you're there and can see how the people interact.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not trying to distract from the thread; just answering a throw-away question.

I like where this thread is going, I love some GNS/CA talk and I appreciate you taking it in this direction.<br/><br/>To me, and this is a bit colored by the pre-Forge take on the threefold, the last example would probably not be gamist since gamist in that context is "It's important to provide appropriate challenges", though whether those challenges are diegetic (create a murderously hard dungeon they can use guerilla tactics to traverse, smoking out the ogres, like your second example) or mechanical ("combat as art" vs interesting monster powers and terrain squares, like your first/third example).<br/><br/>Yeah, the first two examples were ones I had in mind also.<br/>The third example (the "participationist" group), it seems they might value Right to Dream but it seems they value both of the other CAs higher. "Guiding them from one combat to another" seems like a stretch with sim. The combats are all designed to be winnable... and the out-of-combat stuff is handled with counter-sim techniques...<br/>Naw, I'm calling shenanigans on that one. They could be playing Narr if they were playing it like 3:16 or they could be playing Gam if they were enjoying the combats but in the Sim, why are they "running the simulation", where is the "exploration squared"?<br/>Whenever I play to any CA, I like to "play to find out". Such a great slogan and it applies to narr, gam and sim. But in the third examples, they're not playing to find out in the sim sense, are they? They are safe in the DM's hands.<br/><br/>I think in the last, fourth example, participants would probably have some sort of ideas in mind if/before they drop the flashlight; I touched on this "Them learning to hold on to the flashlight could be an interesting future growth opportunity. And guilt over causing the death of their comrades.". Being torn between the opposites of safe cowardice and risky courage can cause a lot of interesting narr moments and some flashlight dropping in the beginning of such a campaign can be awesome, but yeah, also frowned upon of course.<br/>I suggest using the archipelago cards <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> "Perhaps you do not drop your flashlight after all"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443385/#Comment_443385" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T21:36:35+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  9:36PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 9:39PM by Airk.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Your original example was "running away leaving the rest of the group to TPK".</blockquote>\nA.

No good.<br/><br/>Also, with regard to your comments on Paul's post, I think he successfully disproved your "This is proof of a gamist agenda" theory with example <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> alone.  You seem to be focusing on "But example 3 is not sim!" - when, in fact, no one has claimed it is.  I would argue that sim is the ONLY one of the agendas in which this sort of behavior might be considered appropriate, simply because of the aforementioned "narrative casualty" effect above - a near TPK throws away TONS of development and story, both existing and potential, for the "discovery" (Actually, it's usually not a "discovery" because someone has already written down "Coward" in their flaw field and even ingame, there should be signs that this fellow is easily scared.  It's not "fear" is a binary "I'm perfectly fine" or "I flee in abject terror" emotion.) that a character will run away and abandon their allies. <br/><br/>Which brings us back to "How is it sim that people are so foolish as to accept this guy as a trusted travelling companinion in the first place?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443408/#Comment_443408" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T04:43:14+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  4:43AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>--If using these traits causes you fuck up the game\u2026<br/>--Yes?<br/>--You get rewarded!<br/>. . .<br/>I also took the opportunity to say that there was no one mission or story, and started them off with a wrecked ship near a small point crawl (with some dungeons, a village, an abandoned village, and a bandit camp) I had created and a severe lack of rations on their part and a lack of food in the near village and we played to find out.</blockquote>That sounds amazing.  I'd never really noticed before how good a match those two play styles are:<br/><br/>1) Prioritize drama and entertainment, play characters who don't always make optimal choices, do not fear failure or bad things happening to your character.<br/><br/>2) Lethal sandbox play, where we all accept that any given dungeon room might kill you, and it's okay to go do something else instead, or to make another character and try again.<br/><br/>I feel like we need a big campfire for OSR grognards and indie hippies to join hands around.<br/><br/>On the negative side, if I were doing this, I would worry about PC death ruining some character arcs-in-progress, and trouble-seeking ruining the strategy in mission-tackling.

It was what happened, so how can that throw away development? It's like "Ismael marrying Queequeg was such a waste, it threw away all the stories I had in mind shipping him with Ahab".<br/><br/>I hated the time-rewind in our game and I'd be loath to do it again, but I'd rather see a time-rewind than going against "what would happen". Someone got scared and dropped the flashlight, OK, that's canon. All of the other development is only theoretical, it's AU. If you have a particular development in mind, you're already having problems. In fact, with my Lab Lord character who died, I had a great idea for what would happen at level four. I never got there, should I hate the DM for portraying the bone golem as a killer?\n<blockquote>Which brings us back to "How is it sim that people are so foolish as to accept this guy as a trusted travelling companinion in the first place?"</blockquote>\nWhat's the most foolish, having a scared friend or going into a shoggoth tunnel? Neither seems foolish to me but maybe I am a fool also.\n<blockquote>That sounds amazing.  I'd never really noticed before how good a match those two play styles are:<br/><br/>1) Prioritize drama and entertainment, play characters who don't always make optimal choices, do not fear failure or bad things happening to your character.<br/><br/>2) Lethal sandbox play, where we all accept that any given dungeon room might kill you, and it's okay to go do something else instead, or to make another character and try again.</blockquote>\nWhen I saw Gygax quotes to the effect of "This isn't theatre, your character should be similar to yourself", it was already too late for me. I've been playing in this style for years.<br/>Actually, I don't think I would play if I had to be myself.\n<blockquote>On the negative side, if I were doing this, I would worry about PC death ruining some character arcs-in-progress, and trouble-seeking ruining the strategy in mission-tackling.  Is your 5e game pretty light on the "strategy should matter!" front, Sandra?</blockquote>\nNo, it's brutal. I'm an SDK-level Go player and I bring it to every encounter. Goblins and stirges have killed so many characters. Hobgoblins who grab a hold of the "tank" PC, pull him out of the way, restrain him and shoot the wizards. The monsters fight dirty as hell.<br/><br/>But whether tactics should matter or not is up to the players. One of my goals (and this is a path forever leading towards the horizon, not something that's ever fully realized) is a very player-driven game. Always, always: "What do you do?"<br/><br/>In that one game "We get rewarded?", the guerilla tactics didn't matter because the PCs left the dungeon and went to the village, running cons and playing with their disguise kits and breaking into houses.\n<blockquote>If you're still reading old Forge stuff, there's a long <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=22017.0" rel="nofollow">thread</a> about my Werewolf game where Ron Edwards tries to diagnose our CA.  Years later, we agreed that he got it wrong, despite my pages of evidence and all the time he spent analyzing it.</blockquote>\nI'll read it, I hadn't seen that one yet I think.\n<blockquote>I think Creative Agenda is a very cool and useful concept, but I think G vs N vs S is an incredibly mixed bag, with more harm than good in most forum chats.</blockquote>\nTo me, going back to the threefold has been helpful. It did solve a lot of problems on rgfa. I always thought GNS obsoleted it fully, but there's some great sim insights there.\n<blockquote>Better to understand exactly what fits your game and follow that than be concerned over whether your particular game's CA falls just over the line on the S side or the N side.<br/><br/>There are far more than three CAs - each game is unique. It's just that the Model groups them in three general areas with common points.</blockquote>\nI like this.<br/><br/><br/>It's odd, I always avoided sim because it was presented as slower, more detailed, I was intimidated. But neither Kromm, Hite or Mook (famous gurps writers) play Sim when they play GURPS, they railroad (don't think that's true for Hite anymore, but it is for the others).<br/><br/>The other big reason I avoided sim was that I didn't know how to start. Simple maps and simple tables would've been a great way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443421/#Comment_443421" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T09:04:10+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  9:04AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I always avoided sim because it was presented as slower, more detailed, I was intimidated.

Using multi-step rules for figuring out wind direction when firing a weapon etc.<br/><br/>\u2022 hard to start<br/><br/>To me, it certainly seemed that way. "I have to create an entire <em>world</em>? That's not possible!"<br/>To then hear Moldvay say words to the effect of "Make one dungeon. The PCs start at the maw of it. Go play." was mindblowing.<br/>I'd have thought that was railroading... but you've got to start somewhere. So we started there.<br/>Krause's suggestion to the effect of "Make a town, make a few dungeons, make wilderness tables, go play" was also great.<br/><br/>\u2022 benefitting from maps and tables<br/><br/>It certainly does. I don't have to think in terms of "scenes" or "what if" considerations. "The PCs are standing in front of a dungeon. What if they decide to go the other way? OK, the PCs are standing at a road leading away from the dungeon." and so on. Writing a detailed scene for every situation. That sounds absurd and of course I never actually <em>did</em> that, but that was what I thought the game texts wanted. So I started winging instead, which led to a decades-long series of bad sessions, and I finally got my hands on D&amp;D and went... "OH! Duh... of course that's better!" (Learning inform 6 and 7 was also, as I've previously mentioned, a real eye-opener.)<br/><br/>\u2022 easy to consciously avoid<br/><br/>Heavy use of "Drama" as adjucator instead of Karma and Fortune and you're out of sim land, easily enough.<br/><br/>I'm oathsworn, since a few years back, to try to avoid discussing semantics and trying to push for a certain definition.<br/>Given that, I have to rephrase what I originally was going to post here.<br/>I was using a definition of simulation that's like this:<br/><br/>"Simulation heightens and focuses Exploration [in the big model sense, not the three pillars sense] as the priority of play". &lt;- That's Ron.<br/>"the style which values resolving in-game events based solely on game-world considerations, without allowing any meta-game concerns to affect the decision." &lt;- That's Threefold.<br/><br/>I know GNS wants to not be bound by "appeals to authority" of threefold. But in this case I think the two statements are compatible enough.<br/><br/>To avoid this, you simply value other concerns higher than the gameworld (both diegetic and systematic) causes and effects.<br/>To embrace this, you simply start digging on the gameworld causes and effects.<br/><br/>The rgfa discussions tended to associate detail, complexity and "slowness"/deliberation with sim play so I, lazy as I am, of course gravitated away from anything "sim"-connected because I thought it had to be complicated and slow.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443424/#Comment_443424" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T09:35:52+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  9:35AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is also Ron: "Used properly, the terms apply only to decisions, not to whole persons nor to whole games."<br/>Even so, it's easy to see how someone could shy away from sim-style decisions in one phase of her life, and then love them and go to them often in the next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443425/#Comment_443425" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T09:47:44+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  9:47AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking of it in terms of decisions, I can see:<br/><br/>\u2022 Narr motivations for dropping the flashlight.

Just added a note about the Forge threads.<br/><br/>My basis for decisions... I think you and I have the same broad goals, but very different preferences about the details.  I'll talk about my game <i>Delve</i>, which reflects my taste on these matters.<br/><br/>I like games and goals and challenges and measurable progress, but I also like to spend as much of my play time as possible in a state of "feeling like I'm there" immersion, just communicating via fiction rather than interacting with formal play procedures.  Every time I pick up a die, that's at least a tiny reminder that I still exist in the real world, so I try to minimize that stuff.  So, my solution is to make the characters' actual lives be as much of a challenging game with measurable progress as I can.  So that "just playing your character" <i>is</i> playing a game.  I mandate at character creation that every character needs to have certain goals, and I've created a world wherein the only way to achieve those goals is to tackle the challenges and puzzles in the setting.  (A lot of D&amp;D games wind up doing this, but sometimes without the sync between goals and tasks it can wind up feeling game-motivated rather than character-motivated.)<br/><br/><b>Players:</b><br/>Anyway, once all that is rolling, the players' basis for decisions is "what does my character value" at the broad, sandboxy, mission-choosing/defining level, then "what's the most optimal approach I can come up with" when there's something on the line to be gained (factoring in both short-term "I want this NPC to give me the key now" and long-term  "but I also want him to like me later").  And then back to "what does my character value" when it's time to bask in victory, milk latest achievements, etc.  <br/><br/>Some people ask about which one trumps the other, values or effectiveness, but I don't think it's possible for the two to conflict.  The ultimate decision rationale is, "What can I do that is most optimal, given what I value?"  Just because character values provide part of the constraints of the challenge arena, that doesn't make the challenge-tackling any less fun or important.<br/><br/>Because everyone is deeply in character, reactions are what they are -- if you freak out and run, then you freak out and run; there's no question of "if" your character "would" do that.  No one's picking options for some purpose like spicing up the story.  We just react as if we're there.<br/><br/>Players don't have to literally play themselves, but they do have to create characters whose skins they can inhabit unconsciously, without effort.  And there are no mental stats or mechanics to help with decisions, so your character is always as smart as you are, come problem-solving time.  Every challenge-tackling decision you make is always the best that you, as a player, can do.<br/><br/>As for player decisions beyond "what my character does", there are also coverage and pace-of-play decisions (basically, "the characters do X; speed through, summarize, or cover in detail?").  These are based on what mood everyone's in at the moment, and how much they think they could get out of events by playing through them in detail.<br/><br/>Ephemeral stuff like, who talks in character -- there's no decision there.  My rule is that, when we're playing through a scene, you <i>must</i> speak in character (and signal when you aren't, if not obvious).<br/><br/>Next post: The GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443437/#Comment_443437" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T11:17:05+00:00" title="February 27, 2015 11:17AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2015 11:25AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As GM, my basis for decisions looks like this:<br/><br/><b>In prep</b>, I use the tarot-card system I've devised for setting up problems, possible solutions, and ways to unearth those possible solutions.  The cards themselves will then be accessible to the characters as vague hints.  <br/><br/>The game has few stats, and I do zero rules-based challenge-level calibration.  The calibration I do looks mostly like this:<br/>- The new magical effect I'm going to hit the PCs with -- how exactly does it work?  Is it a meaningful threat without being unavoidably lethal?  If yes, then I'm ready, and also ready to accept improv thanks to understanding how it works.<br/><br/>I also choose my magical effects based on where the characters are in their path of discovery -- which secrets they're in the process of learning, and what's a helpful next step.<br/><br/>My basis for all the content I invent is the tone and the metaphysics of the setting.  Basically, real-world history with modern accessibility and a few secret principles of magic, demons and the cosmos.<br/><br/>I also like novelty and try not to repeat myself.<br/><br/><b>During play</b>, my basis for decisions is usually a semi-unconscious process of trying to inspire the players and then follow whatever they're enthused about, but it's always constrained by my vision of the setting (and what I already know about it, factually, from my prep).  If they come up with a slick plan and they think it'll work, then it usually does; but when I know something they don't, then I will enjoy surprising them.<br/><br/>When I'm running NPCs and monsters in the moment, I usually have an intuitive sense of how they'll behave, based just on my taste and mood when I invented them.<br/><br/>When intuition doesn't guide me, I'll default to a stock character or situation that I've done before.<br/><br/>When intuition guides me toward a danger zone, sometimes I don't notice.  When I do notice, I'll pause my talking, review my notes (or pretend to) to buy a moment for reflection, and quickly figure out a better option.  If I can't, we'll just play until we enter the danger zone, and then use my bailout tools.<br/><br/>For a situation that's simply pointless to play through, my bailout is the pacing control -- speed through, summarize, cover in detail.  Once players start down a dead end, I'll ask a few questions, then speed through telling them how it turns out to be a dead end.<br/><br/>For a situation that's important but tedious, my bailout is a decision tree sheet to help the players organize their process and get the necessities out of the way as fast as possible.  (This is a work in progress.)<br/><br/>For a situation that's gonna kill them without fair warning, my bailout is to say "I described it wrong".  The social contract in Delve is that the setting won't just randomly murder you -- the challenges of play are not about survival unless the players choose to make them so.  The risks instead are your progress toward your goals -- losing magical items, severing useful connections, missing opportunities, needing a month to heal injuries while the world moves on.  There's nothing in the setting that says the PCs <i>must</i> be killed without warning, so if my intuition ever leads me there, I view it as optional, not mandatory, and thus as my own mistake.  "Sorry guys, I described it wrong, the flaming column doesn't <i>fill</i> the hall, it just <i>bisects</i> it.  Oops!"  Sometimes I'll even pretend to be reading from something, to minimize the chance that anyone might get their immersion dented by watching me obviously make up content.<br/><br/>I will also use this "Oops!" if I accidentally do something inappropriate to the reality of the fiction, like forgetting the season or time of day or name of an NPC or how hard it is to load a crossbow.  Only if someone notices, though -- the fiction just needs to be real to <i>us</i>.  If we're all incorrect about crossbows, but none of us knows that, then whatever, man.  "Oops!" is not perfect, but it's functional, and I don't have to do it very often (maybe once every few sessions).<br/><br/>Patterns:<br/>That first paragraph of "during play" has all kinds of emergent effects -- I tend to adjust challenges on the fly to aim at the sweet spot of "most fun", for example.  I don't do this as discreet decisions, though; it's more a function of being a fan of the characters and excited to see them progress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443441/#Comment_443441" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T13:24:28+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  1:24PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it seems like we have taken different journeys to find where we are in gaming right now.<br/><br/>Picking up a die:<br/>I used to think I felt exactly the same way but I don't. (Not saying I'm right now and was wrong then.) Now, I really value the oracular power of dice.<br/>I want to use dice to answer questions about the game world. It's still an open-ended game, it's not "the game is happening completely over in dice-land and we have to remember describe it in flavor terms as we go along", it's more "Who's walking down that hallway? Let's consult dice!"\n<blockquote>Because everyone is deeply in character, reactions are what they are -- if you freak out and run, then you freak out and run</blockquote>\nThat's awesome!\n<blockquote>And there are no mental stats or mechanics to help with decisions, so your character is always as smart as you are, come problem-solving time.  Every challenge-tackling decision you make is always the best that you, as a player, can do.</blockquote>\nI run D&amp;D <em>kinda</em> the same way. You never have to play dumb. If your Int -3 character wants to come up with the solution to the problem, that's fine. She just don't know as many spells and languages, that's all.<br/>But I've had players do things that they themselves would never do but their character would do and I'm cool with that.\n<blockquote>My rule is that, when we're playing through a scene, you <i>must</i> speak in character (and signal when you aren't, if not obvious).</blockquote>\nI try to lead by example when it comes to that. I've gone gradually from "She asks you about the quickest route through the forest and she sells you that jar you wanted" back to "This jar? You wanna buy my jar? 300 GP."<br/>It's caught on (or... maybe I catched it from my players?) but there's no rule about it.<br/><br/>As for DMing style.<br/>I've already mentioned that I played a fully improvised style for decades and that it's often dissatisfying for players. The agency was low because while you could go or do what you wanted, there was no "there" there, it was all just whatever I wanted to say, often leading up to endings I (sometimes subconsciously) had in mind.<br/>I'm not implying that your style is that way at all, far from it! But your style is one that I would tend to "forget to use" and slip back into old habits.<br/><br/>When I run games like Fate (which advocates setting scenes with clear questions as you go along) and Dungeon World, I tend to get so caught up in it that I forget to follow the rules and go back to my old, very ingrained full-impro style without following moves or setting clear scenes-with-questions.<br/>That's why having the maps and dice help me a lot.<br/>I love it when the dungeon has this:<br/>"There are four paintings in this room, the third one has a picture of a vase of flowers, but it also looks like a skull if you squint" and no descriptions of the other three paintings.<br/><br/>If the players ask me "What's on the second painting?" I'll make one up and I love that, but I've lessened the risk that it just becomes "come follow along with the DM's story" because there <em>is</em> a clear place that the players can affect for real. There are blanks, yes, like "What's the wall like", I love coming up with answers for that.<br/><br/>That's why I so far haven't ran much of my truly own material. I've used some randomly generated dungeons that I tweak and I've used classic modules. It's because I rely on the other designers as a scaffolding to keep from falling back into my own bad habit.<br/><br/>Thanks for writing about the details.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443457/#Comment_443457" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T17:53:00+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  5:53PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2015 5:56PM by Airk.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is mind-melting to me.

What we're discussing here  - essentially random death - is more like when an actor doesn't want to renew their contract and do another season of a show, so suddenly their character is killed in a car crash, leaving all their arcs completely unresolved and probably doing the same for any other characters who had story involving them.

And we've already discussed how it fits poorly with gamist play. As a result, that leaves sim... occasionally.<br/></blockquote>\nReally? I don't think so. In certain types of games - and stories - character death is an absolutely vital part of the experience.<br/><br/>In the Story Now ("N") category, it's often because putting your character's life on the line is one of the most powerful thematic statements you can make. However, the threat of death has to be <i>real</i> for that to take place.<br/><br/>Similarly, if dealing with the death of a certain protagonist is central to the nature of the game (3:16, perhaps? War epics? Family tragedies?), then it <i>must</i> be part of play, as well.<br/><br/>In Step On Up ("G") play, character death is a very obvious yardstick for success and failure (most video games operate this way, as do games like old-school D&amp;D). Many Gamist adventures would simply not be satisfying under this Agenda without the possibility of character death. <br/><br/>In Right to Dream ("S"), character death is perhaps the least likely to be a vital feature. What's it for, after all? We don't need to it to address premise or to show the outcome of failed challenges. <br/><br/>Still, in some forms of Right to Dream play, it could be very important (for verisimilitude, for a sense of "stick to what would happen"-ness, for maintaining the logic of the gameworld, or for following the expectations of the genre, just as some examples - a Call of Cthulhu game which seeks to emulate H.P. Lovecraft's stories, including the terrible death of the protagonists at the hands of otherworldly horrors, being a prime example of such a Right to Dream game).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443462/#Comment_443462" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T04:24:22+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  4:24AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Paul!  GNS minefield aced!<br/><br/>Airk, I know you have a point about character death here, but I think the core of it is the part that's not agreed upon: "random".  I think we all agree that having significant outcomes (like character death) determined <i>for literally no reason</i> does indeed suck.  The sticking point is that there <i>are</i> reasons for characters to die, and they vary from game to game.  I think the relevant question isn't whether it seems random to us, on the outside, speculating after the fact; it's whether it seems random to the players in the moment.  If it does, then I'm with you, dropping the flashlight is shitty play.  But it's not hard for me to imagine reasons why the players might be on board with it.<br/><br/>There might be some more specific analysis from earlier in the thread that's intruding here, where some evidence has been presented that it <i>is</i> random to the other players in the game, but if so, I've lost track of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443463/#Comment_443463" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T04:55:40+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  4:55AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2015 4:57AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few scattered random thoughts:\n<blockquote>Picking up a die:<br/>I used to think I felt exactly the same way but I don't.</blockquote>I don't have anything against quick and clear usage of dice.  The classic "we try to do a minute task, does it work, yes or no" die roll doesn't interrupt my immersion very much, if at all.  And difficulty calibrations that are mapped entirely to describing the fiction ("the cliff is steep and slippery, Incredibly Difficult for a regular person, merely Difficult for you with your climbing expertise, target number 10") aren't too bad either.  The thing I really like to avoid is <i>attention</i> to the dice and the rules as things in and of themselves.  With a super quick "target number 10" and a super quick "roll: 11 -- success", we can kind of parse the whole experience as just "my character succeeds" and stay in the fiction.  But doing math and looking stuff up and reconsidering actions once you know the dice odds -- that blunts the fun for me.  So it's a matter of degree.  <br/><br/>There's also the fact that, if the GM is honestly acting as the presenter of a fictional world, and the players know this, then there's rarely any <i>need</i> to use dice.  <br/><br/>I'm not necessarily recommending this for you; just wanted to explain why it works for me.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Because everyone is deeply in character, reactions are what they are -- if you freak out and run, then you freak out and run</blockquote>\nThat's awesome!</blockquote>I should probably note that another character-creation requirement is that the characters be very willing to face danger for what they want.  So we don't have any surprises of the "Why would you run from <i>that</i>?" variety.  It's more that, if I'm trying to make them snap with awful horrors, one might snap before the others.\n<blockquote>I've already mentioned that I played a fully improvised style for decades and that it's often dissatisfying for players. The agency was low because while you could go or do what you wanted, there was no "there" there</blockquote>I know what you mean.  I have this happen every once in a while, when the players are just having a bad day and maybe aren't totally committed to playing, but none of us thinks to stop and reset, so the characters just do something, and I need to respond, and I'm totally uninspired.<br/><br/>Usually, though, the players have something they're excited about doing, and I have my vivid vision of the setting right there in my mind's eye, plus background from knowing how the world works, and that's all I need.  In that situation, "there" will just automatically be there.  I do look at some templates pre-game as reminders, though -- the standard medieval village, the standard orc ziggurat, etc.\n<blockquote>often leading up to endings I (sometimes subconsciously) had in mind.</blockquote>I could claim I never do this, but that wouldn't be 100% true.  The truth is more that I've gotten better at having "my endings" be situations, Bangs for the players really, as opposed to "final word, all done"-type endings.  <br/><br/>No GM who invents their own fictional arc wants it to fall flat -- we all want the players to respond strongly.  Once I spelled that out for myself, I think I pretty much limited my "this is what's up because I think it's cool, period!" stuff to smaller moments of play, not crucial mission stuff.  <br/><br/>I'm still very liable to get caught up in describing a location as the characters explore it, even when there's no point and a fast-forward would better serve the pacing.  But hey, the players have the power to speed me up if they want to, so I don't feel too guilty about it. \n<blockquote>But your style is one that I would tend to "forget to use" and slip back into old habits.</blockquote>Yeah.  This is why I haven't published <i>Delve</i> yet.  I am underwhelmed by the powers of RPG advice text.  I'm still working on turning all this stuff into concrete, easy-to-use procedures and rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443466/#Comment_443466" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T06:13:35+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  6:13AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2015 6:42AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>Incidentally, I think the reason you're occasionally getting confused by CA stuff is because you're trying to think in terms of "what I do as the GM", whereas CA is all about the group's reward cycles. What any one player does (even the GM) in terms of specific techniques doesn't necessarily set the table for the whole game, just like how in soccer all the players are trying their best to win while the referee is trying to be as impartial as possible - just because the referee is being impartial doesn't mean the game isn't competitive, in other words.<br/><br/>Have you read Eero's "challenge-based adventure" stuff? It's basically the style of gaming you're describing, but with a very clear Gamist CA as an expressed goal. If you haven't read it, you should!<br/><br/>(As another example, Apocalypse World is a total sandbox adventure game - using a lot of similar GM techniques - but with a strong implied Narrativist Agenda.)<br/><br/>Having a strong, clear CA allows you to cut through a lot of tough spots in such a game, by giving you a very clear direction to head in when things get murky.<br/><br/>In your case, it sounds like you're applying a whole variety of GM techniques which are, essentially, "Simulationist" (in the Threefold sense, not the Big Model sense). But that doesn't necessarily make the entire game Sim, you dig? <br/><br/>If you're setting up challenges and adjudicating them as fairly and impartially as possible, but the players are trying their best to WIN, dammit! - then you are using certain "Threefold-Sim" GM techniques to help facilitate or support a Gamist mode for the whole group.<br/><br/>At least that's how the Big Model would parse this, as far as I understand it.<br/><br/>In Eero's D&amp;D game and in Apocalypse World, there is a clear "thing" for the GM to do in situations where she is NOT clear on what should happen next:  Eero says, "offer the players another potential challenge, negotiate with them if they're interested/offer to skip ahead to the next challenge everyone is interested in dealing with", whereas AW says, "escalate the situation by making it less stable, typically by threatening something the characters care about". What do <i>you</i> say when you're lost and stuck? What's your yardstick?<br/><br/>(I'm only bringing this up because you seem interested in it. I could be totally off-base in my assessment - this is just a guess based on what you're written. And you obviously have an interest in character drama, as well - ideals, Inspiration, and flashlight-dropping as revealing something about Character rather than about tactical decision-making. So your desired CA here might not be as clear or as simple as in Eero's approach to this kind of gaming. [Ron would probably say that you could very well end up drifting harder towards one or the other over time, as the group plays over an extended period. Whether that's true or not, I don't have enough experience to say! But, for example, Eero's D&amp;D at first had a lot more typically story-gamer/Narrativist stuff in it which they trimmed back over time.])<br/><br/>Dave, <br/><br/>Do you parse this kind of thing in a particular way in Delve? Your methods, again, are similar, although you seem to put more stock in continuous drama/action/events (not necessarily in a Dramatic sense, but in the sense of avoiding boredom, which, for example, Eero does not consider a GM task but a player priority) and immersive techniques. But do you see what the GM does in Delve, relative to the players, as falling somewhere specific in the CA spectrum, or is it still something you're thinking about it and pondering for now?<br/><br/>You put a lot of weight, from what I can see, in making sure to set everything up BEFORE play so that the game itself can move ahead with only the GM making "meta-level" decisions to keep things moving, while the players can simply "play their characters" as immersively as possible (or as immersively as they like, anyway). <br/><br/>This is in contrast to Eero's D&amp;D or Apocalypse World. You want all the dominos to be set up before you play (characters with proper motivations, interesting locations and material), so that playing is all about knocking over the dominos and watching the fun, without ever "coming up for air" (or as little as possible, anyway). <br/><br/>Eero says something like, "First of all, the players are responsible for moving the game along and finding fun things to do, not the GM. And any of us (GM included) can and should, at any point, break the fourth wall and say, 'Hey, this is not interesting anymore; let's focus play on this thing instead.' " In his game, it's totally cool to say, "Hey, does that look like a domino to you over there? Ok, let's line it up with this one and that one, plus I'll roll a die to see how many more might get knocked over.

The GM has various responsibilities related to all of these:<br/>- Prep is mostly about making sure that there are fictional challenges available for interaction, fictional rewards to be won, and signals to the characters about their opportunities.  Some formulating a vision of the setting is also required.<br/>- Narrating the setting in play is mostly about keeping play immersed and colorful.<br/>- Deciding what happens when the PCs pursue stuff is an appeal to "what would happen", with the GM as the initial arbiter but not necessarily the final word (as per the <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow">comics</a>).<br/><br/>I don't think any of this is emblematic of "Gamism", broadly, but it all supports Delve's specific creative agenda (which does happen to be, among other things, Gamist).<br/><br/>For GM prep and ad lib, I've defined prep in terms of the bare minimum, because that's what I do.  GMs who don't enjoy/succeed at winging "what's around this corner" and "what's this NPC like" should prep more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443469/#Comment_443469" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T07:36:07+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  7:36AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice: Yeah, I've mentioned that I don't use that many skill rolls, I'm way more often going "What are you doing exactly?" when the players ask for "We wanna do a search roll". I do use saves and passives though, as a backup system for the players. And I love the dice for wandering monster checks. "You wanna rest for an hour? Here? OK\u2026" [picks up half a dozen d6:s].<br/><br/>Airk: Trusting "the system" more than my judgment? Sure, I'd agree with that. That'd help explain a lot of things in the "sandbox design" thread also.<br/><br/>CA: How about this take on it, which may be a dead end: What do I get my kicks from, when playing? It's when the system makes the world "come alive", "tangible". I think it was Paul that called this a "technical agenda" last summer. When the SIS almost takes on a life of it's own, I'm happy, when I can remember and believe in it, I'm happy. Exploration [in the GNS sense rather than the three pillars sense]. D&amp;D is a group effort, though. It's a player driven game. If they come to the table hungry for narr kicks or gam kicks, they'll find it and grow it. The players set up goals for themselves in the sandbox I'm trying to portray vividly (which is also one of AW's principles, right?).<br/>They're all veterans of GM-less games like Fiasco. Now they have a DM to provide the "world" for them. It's more up to them to find and make their own CA kicks. If they wanna go to the dungeon, they know where to find one.

It's not *complete*, in a Big Model sense, but it's a solid starting point you can use to describe your game. It has elements of Right to Dream (the high focus on Exploration) and Step on Up (design of challenges and random tables with more challenges) from the GM side, and room for the players to push it further towards Step on Up or Story Now, as you point out, depending on what they end up pursuing in play. Ron would probably say that your game would settle into an actual, definite CA (if it did at all) over time, as the whole group would start to prioritize certain aspects of play.<br/><br/>Of course, it's also possible that it would remain at this level ("incoherent" was never meant as a negative term at the Forge, but a reference to "coherent" vs. "incoherent" light, i.e. a light bulb versus a laser beam - two different forms of light), if everyone's happy with that, or the group can't all agree on what they want to get out of it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443489/#Comment_443489" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T21:53:35+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  9:53PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The tables have both challenges but also story fodder.<br/><br/>But... today was a con, and I ran a lackluster 5e oneshot and played in a good AW oneshot, so...

Some really like doing funny voices. You sound like you really like building and exploring a vivid fiction (some folks, like Dave and Vincent Baker sometimes refer to this as "high-Colour" roleplaying); I really like that too, and am usually unsatisfied without it. Those are very valid preferences, even though they don't limit you to any particular Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>2. For me, one of the big "deals" about Forge theory was that it moved past others' attempts to classify <i>gamers</i> and talked about groups playing games. You no longer tried to pigeonhole yourself or your friend as "Power Gamer"; instead, you tried to understand what a particular game/group/session/campaign needed to tick, and found ways to bring it out.<br/><br/>Creative Agenda is like food: there are some foods which are sweet (desserts), there are some that are greasy/fatty, and others which are delicacies. Some foods are breakfast foods; others are usually only eaten with dinner.<br/><br/>It would be funny to say: "Oh, man! I'm frustrated! I just can't figure out <i>which cuisine is my favourite</i>! What do I want?!? Arrrgh!"<br/><br/>You can have sweet things for breakfast, and, a week later, have a curry first thing in the morning. <br/><br/>But most people don't combine, say, waffles, pickles, ice cream, hot dogs, whipped cream, and eggplant curry in the same meal. We like things to *make sense*: breakfast foods are such-and-such, and adding fermented beets would be strange. But there's surely some culture or some person out there who does exactly that!<br/><br/>The concept of Creative Agenda, to me, was significant because it allowed me to enjoy each game on its own merits, while remembering that in the next game I could enjoy whatever I missed this time.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443496/#Comment_443496" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-01T07:35:57+00:00" title="March  1, 2015  7:35AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking should get going with upgrading my 5e campaign from Red Tide to An Echo, Resounding (it's not set in the Crimson Isles but I use some of the tags), something I've been procrastinating with forever.<br/><br/>I've known for a while that part of the reason I have such resistance to it is that it's an involved, multistep process that I kind of do understand on paper but I haven't gotten used to it in practice, either.<br/><br/>But this thread leads me to believe that another reason that I've been dragging my feet is that it's a motivation problem, too.

It's like lifting an empty jar that you think is heavy, you might even hurt yourself a little.<br/><br/>Here there's a food (it's called pancakes, but it's nothing like American pancakes, they're thin and basic, pretty much just flour, protein and water) that can be eaten with mushrooms or jams, either way, and I've never thought of it as weird, until one day we were eating it and the mushrooms ran out while we still had pancakes left. The others said "Oh, well, better break out the jams!". I was weirded out and couldn't do it. It's strange, it's not like one is a breakfast food and the other a midnight food, they're both often served as full meals or as desserts. But I've never had them in the same meal or even heard of that.<br/><br/>Maybe that's the ire directed towards the flashlight dropper. "Jams!?

It was probably 1991, I was still in high school. I was at a AD&amp;D table. The GM described a scary situation with some specters. A player said "I'm too afraid - I run away!" The rest of the table turned on him: "You can't do that" "You wouldn't do that" "Come on man" etc. etc.  (I was too new to convention stuff to speak up in either direction.)  The runner, naturally, said it was "what his character would do". The GM didn't take leadership in the situation and smooth it over, eventually the loudest player basically demanded the guy have his character stay, and he did.  I think the theory was "don't sit down to play and then not pursue the objectives of play" - in this case, success in the GM's scenario.<br/><br/>I remember a similar experience a few years later. I was running Call of Cthulhu at a convention and a player said "There's no way I'm going in there, I hang back". Everyone agreed this was fine. I improvised an encounter with some suspicious cultists for that player while everyone else was looking into the spooky cemetery and that was that. I suspect the permission to portray fear is very different in the two games.  (Note that in AD&amp;D et. seq., "fear" is a specific magical effect!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443524/#Comment_443524" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-01T21:37:10+00:00" title="March  1, 2015  9:37PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2015 9:40PM by 2097.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the magical fear effect (it's in Moldvay also) and that affected one of the henches behavior in my game which led to a very poignant scene. I would've never had him just run away and abandon the party on a DM decision, but the spell specified a wis save, which he failed. He was afraid of ghosts. The party blindfolded him but the ghosts spoke. I gave him a new roll, he faile that too and got lost in the dungeon, the new quest became to find him again.<br/>The player characters are so caring.<br/><br/>I see it as a complement to voluntary fear behavior.

It's one of the best explanations I've seen for how a solid CA allows a group to handle challenges together and establish a process of play that *everyone* supports all the time. <br/><br/>The resulting feeling is often one that "the game runs itself!", but Eero's description here (in his example, it's a very clear Gamist agenda in a prototypical D&amp;D game) is by far more on-point than just about any I've seen to date. He follows the Big Model concept of going from the bigger picture - social structure, dynamics, and stated creative goals - and then piercing down into how that guides each deliberate step of the game itself. Ron used to say that "Creative Agenda pierces through all the other layers of the Model"; and in Eero's description he's unusually clear in laying out exactly *how* that takes place and interacts with each level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20047/flashlight-dropper" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20047/flashlight-dropper" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20047/flashlight-dropper/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20047/flashlight-dropper/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20047/flashlight-dropper/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20047%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20047%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Flashlight dropper! - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20047/flashlight-dropper/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Flashlight dropper! - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20047/flashlight-dropper/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Mmm, yeah.

Perhaps you are ready to leave it in the hands of the players (which is a very valid choice) or let it evolve organically, or perhaps you are happy to play in a mode which is slightly "incoherent" (for instance, you let the players go in different directions and support whatever they do).<br/><br/>I linked to Eero's descriptions to show you how a coherent Agenda can help distill what you do and explain *why* you do it, which becomes a set of guiding principles in uncertain situations, and how having everyone aware of that allows everyone to contribute in keeping the game flowing in the right direction.<br/><br/>I don't know if "coherent" games are necessarily more fun than "incoherent" games (if these are even meaningful terms in this context), but Eero is very good at explaining how having a clear CA in the first allows you to develop principles for play, much like how a mission statement or business goal allows a company to make clear calls without having to confer with each other constantly.<br/><br/>For instance, Eero's encapsulation of the role of "challenge" in the game becomes very useful in certain play situations: <br/><br/>Let'say the players are spending a lot of time working out the logistics of how many mules they need for an overland voyage. In a typical game group, one player might be trying to do so as accurately as possible, another might be worried about "losing" by getting it wrong (and therefore the two might clash on the importance of certain details over others), and therefore trying to pay as much attention to it as possible, and a third might be sitting there absolutely bored. As a GM you're sitting there, and not sure how to contribute. Do you try to please the bored player by suggesting we skip ahead, or indulge the player who's interested in historical detail? It's not obvious.<br/><br/>When the group knows what the game is all about (whether it's conscious or just implicit), it's much easier: we can all look at each other and say, "Hey, what's the challenge here? Are we interested in pursuing it? Is it meaningful?"<br/><br/>Maybe there is no significant challenge, or maybe there is but none of us are interested in it. In those cases, the group might just abstract it away: "How about we just say that it costs you 2d10x10 gold coins to buy enough mules for the trip, and only about half of them will survive?" If everyone is happy with that, we move on.<br/><br/>Or maybe there IS a significant challenge, but the challenge is about our water supply (because we're crossing a desert, or water is required for the upcoming adventure, or some such) and not about how much we can carry; if so, we can ignore the irrelevant details (e.g. the carrying capacity of the mules, how fast they move, or whatever we deem an unimportant challenge), and focus more on the details of the water supply (which will then presumably lead to interesting situations in the adventure itself).<br/><br/>Those situations become very easy to resolve and move on.<br/><br/>I don't know if this is helpful to you!

This is "valid" is there's a REASON that one person is rolling two dice and the other one, and that reason is something that can be changed.  If the rules just say "Yeah, one player rolls two dice all the time" (A deliberately unbalanced situation) then no, it's not valid. <br/><br/>This goes back to your Chess example - it's only a "perfect game" if both players get a chance to play White.   So if you've got a rules equivalent of "the same player always has to play Black" then you don't have what most people would consider a valid challenge.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444046/#Comment_444046" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T19:18:49+00:00" title="March 13, 2015  7:18PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul.

It's defined as the glue that holds a group together creatively.  In that model, your personal ideals and goals don't have a simple relationship to actual play.<br/><br/>No <i>type</i> of creative agenda, whether G or N or S or other, is going to completely guarantee, or completely rule out, the sort of exploration that you and I love.  Instead, that type of exploration is about the <i>specific</i> creative agenda (and technical agenda) that we establish with a given group, for a given game.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>- Based on your earlier comments about populating your settings with challenging things for the players to engage with, I am thinking it's at least possible that you might be doing what I do with Delve, which is not-particularly-demanding Gamism with an emphasis on immersion and on maintaining an internally consistent fiction for the group to use as their challenge arena.  <br/><br/>- Or, it might be something totally different, with "challenges" simply there as an opportunity for your group to express themselves about the setting or adventure fiction or something.  <br/><br/>It all depends on what you like about what the other players do, and what the other players like about what you do.  Good immersive GMing doesn't make anyone happy unless there are players there doing something with it.<br/><br/>I don't think defining Sim, Forge-style, adds anything to this conversation.  I recall you having found an earlier definition that you liked; you might want to stick with that.<br/><br/>If you really want to know how Ron Edwards defines it, the best I can do is to keep posting links to threads where he discusses it at length.  I don't love his perspective on it, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444072/#Comment_444072" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-15T02:26:17+00:00" title="March 15, 2015  2:26AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Paul.

In such a game, clearly the focus is on something else entirely - that doesn't tell you which CA is in play, however.<br/><br/>In contrast, I've played in (and read accounts of) OSR-style D&amp;D games where a character reaching 2nd level was met with people jumping out of their chairs, laughing (sometimes even crying), and the fortunate player announcing that s/he will be taking everyone out for drinks. (Like the wonderful <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?676099-B-X-Misadventures-in-randomly-generated-dungeons/page8" rel="nofollow">Fellowship of the Bling</a> accounts.)<br/><br/>Trying to run a game like a "simulation" is a very specific technique, but it does not tell us what the creative goals of a game are, or what importance various decisions and events might have.<br/><br/>Like Dave and Matt (Deliverator) are saying, it's about the *why*. You still have to decide what you're simulating, how often, in what detail, and some kind of organizational principle, whether conscious or not, comes into play.<br/><br/>Let'say we're playing D&amp;D, and using "simulation" techniques to determine "what would happen".<br/><br/>Rognar, brave 7th-level warrior, wakes up in the middle of the night with a full bladder and decides he needs to go make water under a bush.<br/><br/>How do we deal with this? Just knowing that you're going to "simulate" fictional details accurately doesn't - and can't - tell you whether this is a worthwhile situation or a waste of time.<br/><br/>A group which is grooving on some kind of Gamist agenda asks themselves a simple question: is this situation providing some kind of challenge we're interested in seeing this player face? If no, they'll probably skip it. If yes, they'll focus on the elements which are relevant to the situation. <br/><br/>If anything will be simulated, it will be elements relevant to challenge. Perhaps it's how hard it is to maneuver in the dark without waking anyone up, or in the alien climate/landscape where they are. (Admittedly, it's a bit of a ridiculous scenario; it's fairly unlikely that there is challenge inherent in such a situation, and so most groups will be happy to conclude that "peeing in the middle of the night" is not something they're willing to spend valuable playtime on.)<br/><br/>However, Gam challenges can take all kinds of forms - maybe with this group, the challenge is all about how entertaining you can be compared to your peers. In that case, describing how you get up to go pee in the middle of the night would be a very suitable challenge, and everyone would be grinning and watching anxiously to see how player C will manage (or fail) to entertain them by describing Rognar's midnight leak.<br/><br/>The question is: will the player succeed or fail? (Or, alternately, *how much* will he succeed/fail. In some games, failure or success are presumed, and we compete over matters of degree.)<br/><br/>Under a Story Now agenda, this would also be skipped over in most cases, but could become the focus of play if it reflected on a particular Premise relevant to the characters. Were I the GM in this game, I might jump in to say how Rognar's hated enemy's family grave is near the campsite, inviting him to show how much he despises them by urinating on their grave, for example. However, showing disrespect to the dead can disqualify you from a happy afterlife...<br/><br/>Or Rognar's loyalty to the group might be tested: there is nowhere to pee, but his romantic rival's (who is an indispensable local guide, and unwise to piss off) half-empty water canteen is just lying there... will he go for it?<br/><br/>In any case, the question here is: what will the character choose, and what will learn about his values in the process? If the question is obvious, we'll probably skip it and focus on something else, just like in a Gamist adventure we would skip any challenge with an outcome we already know.<br/><br/>When it comes to Right to Dream, my personal interpretation (I have no idea if this is "canonical") is that we're dealing with Exploration, and therefore we will only play out this situation if we see a chance to a) show even further how something already is (add further detail to reinforce something we already know) and celebrate grooving on it together, or b) discover something new about what we're Exploring.<br/><br/>The Big Model had different categories of Exploration: Character, Situation, System, and so forth. Let's say that our particular Right to Dream-focused D&amp;D game was heavily about exploring Character.<br/><br/>In this D&amp;D game, we might like to play out Rognar's nighttime bathroom break to give the player a chance to show what Rognar is like. The player would portray Rognar and describe how careful or brutish or careless or noisy or whatever Rognar is, and we'd all grin and smile because, yeah, that's totally what Rognar would do! We'd be celebrating how *right* the player's portrayal of Rognar felt in that moment.<br/><br/><i>I think D&amp;D fights against mook opponents who are easily defeated are a fairly typical Sim D&amp;D moment: we just want to see the heroes beat up these bad guys, even though we already know they can, just to celebrate one more time how good they are at it. A bunch of people playing canonical characters in an RPG ("You'll be Spiderman, and I'll be Gandalf!"), without trying to subvert them, but rather seeking to play them "straight" might be another example.</i><br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe we'd use Rognar's nighttime bathroom break to learn something new ("Exploration" in a more traditional sense). Maybe we're curious to see if he's a civilized sort or a careless type. I, as GM, say, "Hey, there's a bush nearby, very convenient. But there is also a nice outhouse, with a washbasin, but it's all the way across the road." Which will he choose? Now we know something further about Rognar we didn't know before, and we enjoy learning more about his character.<br/><br/>Or I introduce a feature of the local environment (prickly plants? a local nighttime predator?), and we enjoy discovering what that is like (Oh! Look! The prickly bush only grows in the moonlight, walk under the cliff and there won't be any). Through Rognar, we all learn more about some aspect of this shared fiction, and we all enjoy that (and can reference it later to add more exciting details in the story, building on the knowledge we have now established - "Obviously, there are no prickly bushes in this clearing, since we know the enchantment keeps the moonlight from touching the ground here" - "Ooh, yeah! Totally!").<br/><br/>In a dysfunctional game, though, not everyone's on the same page. I'm GMing and I want to present Rognar with a moral dilemma, so I tell him he wakes up in the middle of the night with a full bladder, but that moving away from the group will the umbrella might expose his beloved to the rain. Rognar's player is looking for the challenge, and confused because he doesn't know where the challenge here is. He wants to know exactly how many feet away the outhouse is and how fast the rain is coming down.<br/><br/>Everyone else is curious to see how much of a jerk Rognar is, so they keep asking whether he's just going to leave the local guide's canteen lying there. The player now has no idea how to contribute meaningfully to the game; Lucy is sitting there altogether bored, because she's only interested in using her new Power Cleave ability and so has zoned out until the next fight.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444091/#Comment_444091" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-15T22:28:51+00:00" title="March 15, 2015 10:28PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>A lot of words just to say that a guiding aesthetic principle is what allows us to build a shared CA, not just specific techniques like "simulationist" GMing.

CA is all about which we prioritize and reward as a group - what things do we do at the table which make everyone else lean in expectantly, listen carefully, nod, and grin and cheer us on?<br/><br/>Again, Eero's descriptions are really good at showing the connection from the "social" layer and Creative Agenda all the way down to the specific decisions he makes as a GM or as a player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444099/#Comment_444099" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-16T10:46:43+00:00" title="March 16, 2015 10:46AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess we have a dysfunctional game where people have come to the table with different CAs in mind and that sometimes shows and chafes.<br/><br/>The most flashlight-dropping player is also the one most often expressing boredom -- and also seems to expect that all fights should be beatable/safe/fair (they're not). The other players have partaked in plenty of narr and instigating but they're optimizing their characters also (while also trying to avoid getting into fights -- they're good at them but try to stay out of them).<br/><br/>So we have one player who's exploring his character through his build, so to speak, but doesn't want to engage with the game world either. He (btw, I pointed him to S-G so if you're reading this, hi! Drop me a line sometimes) gives me the impression of being understimulated with what's in the game world, he nixes the NPCs and their conflicts, he doesn't really engage in the combat (c.f.

They were like "Today's session was much better than your usual sessions" and I was like "Huh? Really!?" (It was a great session but I appreciated last session much more.) and they explained that they felt some sense of partial closure, explanation and partial "wrap up" of some of the predicaments of the NPCs in the dungeon. Taking a step back, the events of the day does look like a proper climax and denouement "arc style".<br/><br/>From my own perspective, it's just that they set up goals for themselves and accomplished them. I just presented to them the game world and played it strictly, using the encounter tables and so on. But what they wanted to happen (to cure some "cursed" NPCs) happened and from the outside, it does look like a "story".<br/><br/>Nothing contrary to my own preferences happened -- quite the opposite, they interacted with the game world and I tried to run the game world fairly. The fact that they managed to pursue and achieve their goals within this world was very interesting. They're always asking for more narr type play but I think we're slowly finding a groove that works for everyone at the table.

(It was conclusive and cathartic, in other words, like the end of a good story.)<br/><br/>Or because they felt a sense of accomplishment? (They set goals and finally reached them, so they're celebrating.)<br/><br/>Or because they were curious about the fates of NPCs they cared about, and have been waiting to find what would happen to them, and this was the session when that finally happened?<br/><br/>Those can overlap a lot, of course, but if they value one more than another, it could be helpful to know that.<br/><br/>If I were GMing for this group, I would try to create a variety of similar challenges/situations/lures (this is a sandbox, right?), each pointing towards one of those directions more strongly, and see what they respond to most.<br/><br/>For instance, hint that this was the first step in a long series of possible accomplishments. Make it seem like Step One in a long plan, so they can look ahead to long-term goals.<br/><br/>Or present them with a bigger, more difficult challenge, and see if that lights them up (like going to the next level in a video game, or meeting the main host of the army in a war, after having defeated the scouting party).<br/><br/>Or give them some more depth in whatever human/emotional concerns they seemed to be interested in with these NPCs. If they rescued a girl who's been enslaved by Orcs, you might set in motion some problems for her to readjust to everyday life - maybe she goes back to her village but they think her "spoiled" by the Orcs and mistreat her or don't accept her, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>(Since we've spoken a lot about Big Model stuff, and I've just listed three examples for each topic, let me emphasize that this is not a G/N/S thing - I'm just picking out three possible elements the group might be enjoying from your brief post, in case something resonates with you. They don't line up with G, N, or S in any particular way; I just happened to think of three different things, in other words.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444575/#Comment_444575" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T08:06:13+00:00" title="April  5, 2015  8:06AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They said things like "I liked it because it felt like this story thread was finally wrapping up" and "We've been asking our way around but now we finally <i>did</i> something".<br/>One thing I've noticed is that if they figure out that one location is from a particular module, they want to "complete" that module, or even if it's a dungeon I've made, they want to "clear" it, explore it fully.<br/>I asked them why this campaign had, after fourteen sessions, been so mostly focused on B4 The Lost City as opposed to city shenanigans, country-side exploration, or JG The Caverns of Thracia which was also placed near the city. They answered "Because when the campaign started, our characters heard that the pyramids in B4 had just yesterday been unveiled by shifting sands, while the caverns had not changed recently. We responded to a change in the setting's status quo".<br/><br/>I like that they're becoming more expressing and insightful about what they like.<br/><br/>A couple of the players expressed that "We kind of forced ourselves to explore the pyramid even though our characters had no real motivation to do so" (they had causes to visit the pyramid but achieved those goals in the first few rooms). Others who did have IC causes to explore the pyramid dissented, but to those who said that they forced their characters to go further down for OOC reasons, I asked why.<br/><br/>I think there's sometimes glimpses of a participationism-expectation in a few of them (while the other two don't have such expectations).<br/><br/>They also said that an issue with the campaign was that they didn't have any real ties to the various factions in the city. Since I was procrastinating on prep in the beginning, these factions didn't crystallize until later and I need to do a much better job on this if I'm going to do another campaign on my own.<br/><br/>So I think they appreciate the same thing I appreciate -- leaving a mark on the game world, having some inpact.<br/><br/>Paul, I think they sincerely appreciated all three aspects of achieving that goal. They had been frustrated with encountering all the "cursed" (not really, but equivalent -- I don't want to give spoilers for B4) NPCs. They cared for them and wanted to help them... they set up the goal to help them, and it took a long time with only slow progress until the last few sessions where progress rapidly escalated (they found a route they had been searching for, once that opened up they could do a lot in a short time).<br/><br/>I need to be careful about using CA terms especially since I do think I like all three. What I like the most however is this Technical Agenda of having a "systematic game world" to interact with as opposed to "No Myth". As long as I can have that, I can make my prep in a way that increases the likelihood (even though it can't ensure) that the player character will encounter/create human stories, interesting challenges and a sense of place.<br/><br/>BTW, D&amp;D's new slogan of "three pillars: exploration, interaction and combat" instantly appealed to me. Dungeon World famously excised all talk about "story" from both the book and the promo materials and I think that's good because it's such a polysemic and loaded term in the RPG world. Similarly, I can't ensure a story when I put together the "petri dish" of the setting. I don't want to be "ouija boarding". But I can put in places to explore, and entities that can interact and/or fight.<br/><br/>I'm glad that my group after 26 sessions now is starting to get better at explaining to me what they want and figuring out what I want. It's the start of a long and hopefully fruitful conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444583/#Comment_444583" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T19:05:35+00:00" title="April  5, 2015  7:05PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2015 7:08PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds very promising, Sandra. And thank you for such a lovely write-up: it's rare to see people describe their gaming with that kind of insight.<br/><br/>I will add this:<br/><br/>If your goal is to "encounter/create human stories", you might consider adding some other tools to your Technical Agenda (as you put it). If you want the *possibility* of human stories, then maybe you don't need to. But if it's something you really want to explore (as a group, I mean), that it would help to have some more (or at least different) GM tools at work.<br/><br/>The easiest way is generally to get the players to do it for you. When I hear something like, "They also said that an issue with the campaign was that they didn't have any real ties to the various factions in the city," my immediate thought is: you can't force these things onto them. (Or, you can, but that's a lot more work, and there's the danger that the players don't buy it even after all that work.) <br/><br/>It doesn't sound like a huge problem to me. (Certainly not a "starting the campaign over" kind of problem!)<br/><br/>Just ask them: Hey, what do you think about this faction? Have you ever heard of them doing anything bad? Why don't you like that?<br/><br/>Which is your favourite faction? If you could join one someday, which one would it be?<br/><br/>If you could change one thing about this faction, what would it be? Do you think that's something you could accomplish, if you were on the inside?<br/><br/>Or you could say to each player:<br/><br/>Let's tie the characters in a little more. Come up with one person who's a close friend or a good contact. Which faction do they belong to? Come up with one person who's an enemy or a rival. Which faction do they belong to?<br/><br/>You can also be more sly about it, of course, if those questions are too direct:<br/><br/>"Hey, guys! I'm just curious: which faction do you think would be the most likely, in your opinion, to do something good? Why?"<br/><br/>"Which faction do you think is the most likely not to be what it seems, or to be hiding something? Why?"<br/><br/>You can do this while hanging out and having some pizza, just chatting about the game. (But do take mental notes!)<br/><br/>Or you can do this in-character: have an NPC ask them the same questions, see what they say.<br/><br/>I bet in 5, 10, or 15 minutes you'd have more than enough material to come up with sessions and sessions worth of interesting stuff. Sometimes you can use exactly what they came up with; other times, you can play contrary to expectations.<br/><br/>-"Which faction do you trust the least?"<br/>-"Those Templars sure seem fishy to me. How did they get to be so strong? They must have some blackmail against the ruler of the region."<br/><br/>BAM! Whether they're right or wrong, there's a ton of material you can pull from that. Why ARE they so strong? Is it a facade, carefully maintained? Or do they have some nefarious connections? Otherworldly powers, contact with demons, contacts with the mafia?<br/><br/>Why would someone suspect the ruler's being blackmailed? Work that into your campaign. Give them some reasons.<br/><br/>All it takes is for you to throw a hook into the next session: oh, hey, it sounds like so-and-so or this-or-that locale (could pick something from one of your available modules) knows something bad about the ruler, stuff no one is supposed to know. The players will likely jump on it right away! <br/><br/>Or flip it around: yeah, sure enough, there's some blackmail against the local ruler (e.g. he or she isn't a legitimate ruler, and the real heir is still alive)... but it's the Templars who are trying to keep that from coming out. Hence the ruler's strong support of the Templars: take that threat away, and the Order will disappear very quickly, having no funds and no popular support.<br/><br/>I can think of a million potential plot hooks/connections from something like that, too.<br/><br/>And that's just from one sentence!<br/><br/>Just a thought: I don't know if it's applicable to your game. Got off on a bit of a tangent there. Maybe someone reading this will find it interesting or useful, anyhow.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444593/#Comment_444593" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-06T01:16:29+00:00" title="April  6, 2015  1:16AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beautiful stuff, from both of you.

You're probably familiar with the old "pages of secret backstory" trope that doesn't really come out in play. He did have his character join another faction once play started.<br/><br/>Another player had an NPC relationship in town (his teacher) but then avoided seeking him out. I had a lot of stuff happen to/with that NPC but it didn't enter play since he didn't visit him. "He could seek me out" -- yeah, how? You're in the dungeon he told you to stay away from and he doesn't have Message prepared and he doesn't really know where you are. Now that I do think of it that way, through the familiar perhaps.<br/><br/>As for the happenstance overlap: Yes, absolutely. But hence communication.<br/>It's also the case that I'm motivated to create a particular game experience, it's what interests me and motivated me to bring the group together and to prep for the game.<br/><br/>The dialogue has two components. On my part, I want to be clear about what the experience is and how I run the game. For the first few sessions last summer, this even included me pointing out parts of the module, demonstrating how I was running the game "I say that because the module has this in it", "These goblin's stats come from this page" etc. Just for the first few encounters. This was when we had players who had never played an RPG before. It seemed to me that expectation setting was very important for a sandbox game. When I was a player (in a different group) I felt I've accomplished my goal <i>in a coherent system</i>, it's all the more satisfying than if the GM used quantum tricks and handwaving. YMMV! I want to bring this experience to the players.<br/><br/>The second component of the dialogue is me seeing what parts of the game seems to satisfy them or frustrate them. My response to that could be things like "OK, they don't seem to like to talk to NPCs, maybe I don't need to work so hard on that (or I need to work harder)", or it can be things like "Of course they don't like book flipping, but they <i>really</i> don't need book flipping, printing out the stat blocks could be worth it". etc<br/>It's also a tradeoff vs my own laziness.<br/><br/>On the one hand: Everyone wants to be the perfect hostess, the perfect DM to serve up the best experience for "their" players that they'll remember for ever. The old "they're my audience" thinking. On the other hand: I'm just one participant in this experience. The success of the endeavour isn't solely my responsibility. As long as I bring to the table what I need to bring to run the game, it's enough. It won't guarantee the best session ever, but who knows? My energy level for prepping and working on the game experience will fluctuate and I need to be mindful to it and not burn out or abandon the campaign. Sometimes "phoning it in" with a skeletal prep is better than cancelling the session.<br/><br/>Prep can scale from "Just put in the monster's name", via "Put in the page number in the MM", to "Type up a short form of the monster's most important stats and traits". (And heck YES I wish they would make the full Monster Manual available in a digitally copyable form. I've already done lots of text/semantic programmatic transformations on the few monsters in the basic PDF.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444643/#Comment_444643" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T07:58:26+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  7:58AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for abandoning the campaign or restarting the campaign...
