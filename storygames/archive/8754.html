Hazmat jumps off the roof of the school and lands on top of it. She tries to get it in a headlock, but it wrenches loose, whips a tentacle around her throat, and flings her at the chain-link fence. Roaring, Hazmat smashes through it and lands in the sand-pit under a swing set.<br/><br/>Me and Casket look at each other. Hazmat is out for the count, and Casket\u2019s face is a mask of blood, black in the moonlight. He got shoved face-first through a car window earlier. Damn, I think. This bastard is taking us apart. I run towards the angel, and the last thing I see is that grinning face blurring towards me.<br/><br/>Later, I\u2019m in the car. Hazmat is driving. I\u2019m in the passenger seat. It\u2019s soaked with my blood. On the radio, an old white man says we need to protect Murrica from tourism. Everything hurts. I pull the aspirin out of the glove box. Empty. I roll down the window. I lean out so I can see myself in the rear-view mirror. My lower jaw is missing.<br/><br/>It wasn\u2019t always like this.<br/><br/><div><img alt="image" src="http://www.neoplasticpress.com/spite-wrap.jpg"/></div><br/><br/>Oh, hai! I can has tentaculz?<br/><br/>Yes, you can!<br/><br/>My new game is called Spite. It's hotter than a thirty-year-old grandma, and it's nastier than a coffee mug full of demon sweat that's been strained through a dead hooker's pantyhose.<br/><br/>I have been working on it, off and on, since 2003. It was originally supposed to be an expansion for Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, but feature creep is a mofo. The manuscript is 120,460 words long. David "ASCII@HACK" Artman is handling the layout, and Spite will be available soon.<br/><br/><div><img alt="image" src="http://www.neoplasticpress.com/spite-art.jpg"/></div><br/><br/><b>I'm taking pre-orders!</b><br/><br/>If you want to pre-order your copy, click <a href="http://www.neoplasticpress.com/spite.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You'll get a free PDF copy when the game is released (to tide you over until the books arrive), along with some top-secret materials that everyone else won't have access to until much later in the year.<br/><br/>Spite is a game of supernatural horror-action. Angels have descended from Heaven, and they have begun to do the things than angels generally do: obliterate cities, spread plagues, rain down blood, and dispatch swarms of locusts to rend the flesh of humans and their cattle.<br/><br/>You have to stop them.<br/><br/>You're a Zealot, a supernatural warrior. Armed to the teeth, brandishing jaw-droppingly weird magics like Blasphemies and Maledictions, you've got to push back the army of angels and protect innocent people from the Tribulation.<br/><br/>Spite uses the same Disciple 12 system as Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, but there are (of course) a lot of updates and upgrades. During the nearly two years since Dread was released, a lot of new features have been added to the system (sniper fire! area damage! mob attacks!). <br/><br/>The game features 100 spells and 94 hostiles, plus information on various factions (cults, military initiatives, federal agencies), magic weapons like Osteons and Aspergilia, anti-angel War Machines, and a couple of scenarios to get you started.<br/><br/><div><img alt="image" src="http://www.neoplasticpress.com/spite-art2.jpg"/></div><br/><br/>This time around, I'm really hoping to do more with promotion. Thus far, I've been busy with the game, but now that the layout is underway, I've started a blog (<a href="http://www.tribulationiscoming.com" rel="nofollow">www.tribulationiscoming.com</a>), a <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/The-Books-of-Pandemonium/52560697688" rel="nofollow">Facebook page</a>, and a fairly robust message board community.<br/><br/>Now I just need to figure out where to go from here. Banner ads? Ad swaps with other RPG developers? Some new community site that I can hijack for my own nefarious purposes?<br/><br/>Halp!<br/><br/>- Rafael                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193598/#Comment_193598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T19:12:27+00:00" title="February 22, 2009  7:12PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That looks INSANELY AWESOME!

Well, easier than a whole new engine. Hmmm.... baddies are easy enough (model and skin), and some magic stuff could be "weapon" mods. Hard to capture the player authority and the investigation stuff, though. Lots of dialogue trees could do it, maybe. Interesting notion.... prototype in Second Life? The Spite Island (COSTLY!)?<br/><br/>Kinda cool to ponder, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194951/#Comment_194951" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T16:59:52+00:00" title="March  1, 2009  4:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A mod could work. But I don't have a lot of experience with Unreal, and even if I did -- when I was finished with the mod, selling/distributing it might be a tad tricky. <br/><br/>As for prototyping -- heck yeah. I am a firm believer in it, and prototyping would definitely be part of the game's development.<br/><br/>I do like the idea of a shooter with some dialogue-tree-type RPG elements. My gut says that Spite would be very heavy on co-op gameplay...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
