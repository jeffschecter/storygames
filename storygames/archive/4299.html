I decided to split it up into three posts focussing on the individual games.)<br/><br/>Last Saturday I ran a Primetime Adventures game at the local con. Two players had already played PTA with me before I thought it was still important to establish certain basics about playing the game early on. Instead of going on about the big picture of PTA (issues, character driven arcs, conflicts, narration rights, etc.) I took the advice of Christopher Kubasik and just dove more-or-less headfirst into the series pitch. One thing that often impressed me with other people's PTA series was the off-the-wall style and concept. The unrestrained nature of the Pitch often lends itself to crazy ideas. One idea we had involved time-travelling international spies fighting over ownership of Alaska. Here something very obvious became clear to me: <br/><br/><b>Crazy doesn't work. Mundane is the way to go!</b><br/><br/>Instead of trying to make the show more 'awesome' and gonzo, it was really good to pull everyone back from the brink and try to stay close to what a typical new TV show might actually look like. Keeping the genre and the style of the show in familiar territory is a good way to ground the game and keep the characters and their issues engaging. Once their problems become too weird the game can turn quickly turn into a farcical game of narrative oneupmanship. I think for an introduction to PTA this is pretty key. Our show ended up as thematic cousin to the movie "The Full Monty". This time a group of farmers band together to form a polo team to save their village. The characters were a former Polo star (Thomas), who was kicked out of the number one Polo team for not being a team player; a Scottish arm-chair general (Craig) whose unbridled hate for the English had made him a social outcast; a Welsh polo coach (I have no idea what his name was) who had a huge falling out with his team and has since battled with depression and Hong Kong Chinese laundromat owner Charlie Weng, who rode his cow Josephine instead of an actual horse, and who was repeatedly victim of crass discrimination. <br/><br/>Even though I bungled the series creation a little, by forgetting to talk about the franchise, the sports comedy genre was enough to easily carry us through the game. I was surprised just how fond I had become of all the characters by the end of the game. It was great to see the whole team stand by Charlie Weng's side, when the veterinarian refused to deal with the injured Josephine and chose to devote his attention to the perfectly healthy horses of the rest of the team. It was just as much fun seeing Craig set aside his irrational hatred for the English and playing a perfect match with Thomas. It was almost heart-breaking to see Thomas almost cost them the game, when he kept trying to wow the audience with his flashy moves and ended up on the sidelines with a dislocated shoulder.   <br/><br/>Finding conflicts and tieing issues to them was a breeze this time around. We didn't have a single scene without a conflict and most of them had numerous characters getting a chance to have their issue play into the scene. Fan mail was - as always - a bit of a problem at first, but after pointing my finger at people for not spending fan mail even though they were loudly supporting something another player did... everybody got into a nice rhythm of giving and spending fan mail. (In case you're not playing with an english-speaking group, I've found that translating the terms on the character sheet and paying close attention to finding appropriate idioms really helped the players get a hold on how to use their characters in the game.)<br/><br/>I felt that the series worked out quite nicely this time around, because of this move to make it a little more mundane and less high-concept and flashy. I will have to keep that mind next time I try PTA with my regular group.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97040/#Comment_97040" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T22:03:19+00:00" title="September 17, 2007 10:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What did the players seem to think of the game by the end?

Just curious.<br/></blockquote>\nI think around here (maybe everywhere?) convention games have the reputation of being very over-the-top or at least a very condensed version of a regular game. So they were a little surprised that the game itself had a few fairly quiet moments amidst the otherwise very busy con atmosphere. It was a very <i>nice and likeable </i>game, as opposed to an awesome one. Although that might have been a big enough break from other games as to make it stand out. <br/><br/>Another thing which helped us keep the game inside our 5h-slot and still allowed for an extensive pitch session and several bathroom and snack breaks, was cutting scenes short, when it seemed as if the players were just aimlessly improvising and trying to eventually resolve the scene. I noticed that it helped when the producer called everyone back to the cards, as they always managed to make the conflicts more personal as they would have been otherwise. By using the issue and thus highlighting it in a conflict the characters come alive in a very different way. The group gets to know them well fast. By the time a character got involved in his third conflict or so, we were already describing actions as "that is so like him".<br/><br/>It seems to me that in the most widely played RPGs the internal conflicts of characters and their personality belong entirely to the player and are off-limits to everybody else at the table. Opening a character up like this and commiting one's self to one kind of struggle seems to be something that players have learned not to bother the rest of the group with (so as to not come across as hogging the spotlight) or simply avoid in general (so as not to be forced to act a certain way later on). In PTA opening up the character appears to be hard-wired into the rules. I realise now that it must have been something earlier players were opposed to and thus struggled against, which lead to some slightly frustrating situationen. Luckily, this group had no trouble just going along with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
