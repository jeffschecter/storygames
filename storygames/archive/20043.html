They want to keep leveling up forever. I could use d20 or d100 but the thing is that :<br/><br/>1) I want to make a cheap game that I can sell in my country; and the only thing you can get here anywhere are common d6.<br/><br/>2) Most players would be new to the hobbie and I found out that if I can appeal to the MMORPGs atmosphere on the mechanics its easier for them to understand and feel comfortable with the game.<br/><br/>3) I've played games that use pools of d6. They are terrific, but these ain't my group's thing, and I'm not used to design thing around those.<br/><br/>Does anyone know of a functional tested d66 game? I'm not even sure about what the probability curves are for that and how far could the bonuses go. I thought I could give players +30 at most, but now I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>Also, one of the players has this thing about numbers in the game; he loves to powergame in order to make sure that his character will accomplish one sigle thing 98% of the time or better. But then he relaxes and roleplays it. He just can't stand that my designs usually give the players a 50/50 chance at high levels against the highest difficulty, even when I won't be using this degree of difficulty often. Strangely, he's okey if the GM just says "no, you can't beat this guy because of reasons right now", though he has pushed a GM before by gaming the system or even the GM plot in meta, but only when said GM used really poor excuses for railroading insted of being honest and say it was railroading.<br/><br/>This player is also a good friend of mine and I'd really like to either get how he gets his fun from this to make a game to his liking or find a way to compromise and make a game that at least he can stand playing. I already got a couple ideas for this, but I would like to hear some other opinions on the subject.

Not sure where to find a middle ground, but there may be a set of rules which gives each of you what you want.<br/><br/>That said, one easy way to use AW mechanics and allow incremental progress is to break the roll into two:<br/><br/>Roll twice. If both succeed, that's a 10+. If neither succeed, that's a miss. If only one succeeds, it's a 7-9.<br/><br/>This allows you to change the odds very slowly, particularly if the two rolls are based on different numbers.<br/><br/>With 2d6, you could do it like this, for a traditional-seeming game:<br/><br/>Roll 2d6, twice. Roll under your score for a success. <br/><br/>For each roll, you combine an Attribute with a Skill, or two different abilities, or whatever. Perhaps attacking someone requires you to roll Warrior + Sword skill, while defending against an attack requires Reflexes + Sword skill, for example.<br/><br/>This means that the player needs to advance two separate scores by +1 to achieve a "net" +1 in terms of his odds, giving you two "steps" per bonus. And even without that, you'll get a much bigger range than in AW as-written.<br/><br/>For example, someone who has a score of 4 has only a 1/36 chance of a full success, a 25/36 chance of failure, and a 10/36 chance of a partial success. <br/><br/>Someone with a score of 5 has a 1/13 chance of a full success, a 1/2 chance of failure, and a 4/10 chance of a partial success. (Very roughly; not exact odds.)<br/><br/>These are pretty similar, but two steps apart in this system (you can have two rolls a 4 or less, one at 4 or less and one at 5 or less, and finally two rolls at 5 or less). Gives a lot of granularity to an AW mechanic with only two dice.<br/><br/>Just a thought; don't know how useful it is to you!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443047/#Comment_443047" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T04:07:18+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  4:07AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The d6/d6 roll you mentioned (I assume you mean rolling one d6 for a tens digit and another for a ones digit.) is used a little bit for specialty purposes in some games, but it's not too popular due to being pretty ugly and not too intuitive. The resulting random distribution is identical to a 1d36, it's just expressed in base 6, so a result of "34" is actually the 16th smallest possible result, "66" is the 36th smallest result, and so on.<br/><br/>To me it seems like if you want to use d6s, don't like dice pools, want uncapped advancement of numbers, and want to also use big numbers for their (debatable) sexiness, then clearly most elegant dice math for you is [ability bonus]+d6 vs. [difficulty rating]. Make that 2d6 or 3d6 if you want a bell curve - most games that use straight bonuses + roll system prefer the bell curve. There are certainly some rather major games out there with this exact setup.<br/><br/>This math has all the qualities you want. It also includes "competency ranges" in that ability at 2 directly implies automatic success at difficulty 1-2 and automatic failure at difficult 9+ (assuming you're rolling a single d6, that is). This is a feature for some types of game, while it is not so for others; if it's important to you that every roll has a chance to succeed or fail, I suggest making the dice explode in whatever manner suits you best, and decree that certain results out of the dice are automatic fails - or "fumbles" - no matter the difficulty or skill involved.<br/><br/>If all of the above seems to you entirely conventional, then perhaps reflect on this: your friend wants an entirely conventional traditional roleplaying game rules system. If you do as well, then it might be a good idea to do that instead of thinking up an exotic dice mechanic.<br/><br/>For a starting point: it is rather easy to play a somewhat different flavour of conventional d20 D&amp;D by substituting that d20 roll with a 3d6 roll - it's surprising how little you'd need to change about the system. What would your friend dislike about a game that was exactly like say 3rd edition D&amp;D (Pathfinder, that is), except it'd have a 3d6 roll instead of the d20?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443048/#Comment_443048" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T04:35:10+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  4:35AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2015 4:35AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only game I know of that uses a d66 is SJG's version of In Nomine.

And then the rules say, "Actually, when it's time for you to really shine at this task, you're basically crap at it. Might as well flip a coin." If the GM says the task can't be done because of reasons -- usually in-genre reasons at that -- that's fine, that's in keeping with the kind of story you're telling. But the whole point of putting the Greatest Safecracker In The World in front of the Most Nigh-Impregnable Vault In The World is to see him open it, not to see him screw up. Any random unskilled jerkbag can screw up opening the toughest lock in the world, but since they didn't invest all of that energy and all of those skill points in opening locks, it's okay and no one really feels bad about it. The expert who fails in that situation? That guy feels like the biggest idiot in the world.<br/><br/><br/>Or alternately, it might be a statement along the lines of "I never want to spend time worrying about how to deal with this kind of obstacle." Making a character who can get that one job done 98% of the time means that 98% of the time the player is never even going to have to think about it. When the rules say that the best person for the toughest job can't actually handle that job at least half of the time, that option is off the table and the annoying, non-fun shit you didn't want to have to deal with is going to be jammed in your face anyway.<br/><br/>It's why it's always a good idea to talk with players about what they like doing and don't like doing in games. If someone's building their character because they want a particular task to <i>not</i> be a challenge, you need to know so that you can give them other (more fun) things to do. If you don't ask, you might mistakenly respond by ramping up the difficulty of that task in order to challenge them, and then no one's gonna be happy.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443055/#Comment_443055" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T09:31:15+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  9:31AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2015 9:35AM by 2097.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice + adds vs TN (target number) aren't usually going to give you 98% success at the highest difficulties.

Can be interesting for certain genres.<br/><br/>Another alternative could be using i.e. playing cards (52cards + 2jokers).<br/><br/>As for dealing with your friend:<br/>Generally, I think it is great if your friend "relaxes and roleplays". If uncertainties like 50:50 situations put him in stress, he might be more happy with a more narrative style or a FATE based game (you can roll d6-d6 instead of Fate/Fudge dice) that is more predictable.<br/><br/>In the AW context, I like moving up to 3d6 (or even higher, though 1d6 is just linear, not attractive). You can combine it with character advancement, combining a higher skill bonus with "levelling up" to 3d6. To make it also desireable to the players, "levelling up" to 3d6 would unlock new moves/options etc.<br/><br/>AsIf:<br/>Thanks for the nice colorful table. What is the "X" in Xd6+Y ? Ok, +Y is the bonus.<br/>Generally as GM, I find it hard to scale difficulties with two parameters.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443063/#Comment_443063" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T11:40:46+00:00" title="February 21, 2015 11:40AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A main question in my opinion is: Do you want a <i>linear</i> probability curve (i.e. d100) or bell curve (i.e. 2d6)?</blockquote>\nI don't see it.<br/>In games where you\u2019re rolling \u201cX or higher\u201d, or \u201cX or lower\u201d, bell curves and linear curves give the same results.<br/><br/>For example, to roll a 7 <em>or higher</em> on 2d6 is exactly the same as rolling 16 <em>or higher</em> on 1d36.<br/><br/>I know three cases where bell curves are relevant.<br/>One is in situations where the exact numbers are relevant. Like in Settlers of Catan where the number rolled gives you a specific resource.<br/><br/>The other is when there\u2019s deliberate conversion distortion effect that you as designer want to achieve.<br/><br/>But the difference between roll under 17 on 3d6 vs roll under 16 on 3d6 is about four times smaller than the difference between roll under 12 on 3d6 and roll under 11 on 3d6. That way you get a \u201cdiminishing returns\u201d effect as you go higher and higher.<br/><br/>The third case is when you want to condense a larger spread into fewer, easier to grasp outcomes. I am, or used to be, huge fan of 4dF because it takes a scale of 81 and map it them to three simple symbols. That way you can have a fine-grained difficulty scale but still represent it with simple plusses and minuses. Like, if you need to end up with ++ on 4dF, that\u2019s the equivalent of needing to roll at least a 67 on 1d81.<br/>However, I\u2019ve found that I don\u2019t really need or want a fine-grained difficulty scale. Honestly, I\u2019d be fine with just rolling one fudge die for everything except maybe for the really long shots.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443071/#Comment_443071" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T18:09:57+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  6:09PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2015 6:10PM by BeePeeGee.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2097:<br/>Well, bell-curve vs linear is less dramatic if you go "at least X" instead of a specific number.

In way to many cases to minimize this case, possible players get scared by all the math, specially when the reasons behind this or that operation aren't clear at first sight. "Ok, I get that I have to roll dice to see if my character gets something done or not, but why so many dice? How do I know when I can use more than one? It's really important to be able to answer clearly and quickly these questions to the players, more than you think if you want the game to appeal to a wider audience.<br/><br/>I mean, come on, the basic nature of roleplaying is incredibly simple. It's cool to refine the math to make the system into an accurate tool to represent different situations, but I'm going into the opposite direction.<br/><br/>As I stated first, for me old 2d6+bonuses up to 4 would be more than enough, but players have consistently been asking me for more. 3d6+ bonuses seem to be a good compromise. It's not a pool (I really don't want to make me rich by selling buckets of dice needed to play my game) nor a single dice. I would allow me to use bonuses up to 20 without breaking the math. In regard to this and something Accountingfortaste mentioned:\n<blockquote><br/>It might be a genre-fidelity thing; you set your sights on playing a character who isn't just good at something, but <i>the best</i> at it. And then the rules say, "Actually, when it's time for you to really shine at this task, you're basically crap at it. Might as well flip a coin." If the GM says the task can't be done because of reasons -- usually in-genre reasons at that -- that's fine, that's in keeping with the kind of story you're telling. But the whole point of putting the Greatest Safecracker In The World in front of the Most Nigh-Impregnable Vault In The World is to see him open it, not to see him screw up. Any random unskilled jerkbag can screw up opening the toughest lock in the world, but since they didn't invest all of that energy and all of those skill points in opening locks, it's okay and no one really feels bad about it. The expert who fails in that situation? That guy feels like the biggest idiot in the world.<br/><br/><br/>Or alternately, it might be a statement along the lines of "I never want to spend time worrying about how to deal with this kind of obstacle." Making a character who can get that one job done 98% of the time means that 98% of the time the player is never even going to have to think about it. When the rules say that the best person for the toughest job can't actually handle that job at least half of the time, that option is off the table and the annoying, non-fun shit you didn't want to have to deal with is going to be jammed in your face anyway.<br/><br/>It's why it's always a good idea to talk with players about what they like doing and don't like doing in games. If someone's building their character because they want a particular task to <i>not</i> be a challenge, you need to know so that you can give them other (more fun) things to do. If you don't ask, you might mistakenly respond by ramping up the difficulty of that task in order to challenge them, and then no one's gonna be happy. </blockquote>\nYes I get your point, but there's another ingredient in this mix that ruins things and it's not in the math, but in the way the GM interpretates the dice. You see, this player has been playing with another two groups where the norm is that when you roll low, the GM describes how your character does something stupid. In some cases, it's even humilliating for the players. I stopped playing with those groups because I really don't enjoy to be put in that situation too often as they did, and also because the only way to stop those GMs from reading the dice like that was by building an impenetrable barrier of bonuses until you only failed at something by rolling a 1.<br/><br/>I'm not so good at math and power-gaming stresses me out, also, having continuous arguments with the GM to defend my interpretation of the rules that gave me those bonuses tired me out, all of which gave me more powerful reasons to stop playing with them. Yet my friend endured it and found out another way of having fun. Now he powergames a bit and also breaks their rails here and there. He's in full control when he manages things to go his way, and having thins g his way is now his way of having fun with those groups. They all go with it (with some complains, but nothing really serious) so it's a valid way of having fun for them.<br/><br/>OTOH there's the way I've been learning to read the dice and use the TN, which is the opposite those GMs do. When players roll low in my games, their characters don't suck; it's just that their enemies are a bit better, or maybe just lucky. They don't just miss, but something interesting happens (they could even actually succeed but something turns that success into a complication instead of solving a problem. TN doesn't matter too much for me, I'm usually going for the average difficulty or one that makes the action a bit more risky (like +3 or +4 more difficult) when the player's plans look more fragile. I let as much as I can happen without any rolls, so players actually get 98% winning chances and 60% chances that something interesting happens, even while the math says that at top level they have 50% chances to lose, which I really seldom apply in full force.<br/><br/>I believe that If I explain my way of interpretating the dice and make it an integral part of the system instead of just puting it down at the "good advice for GMs" chapter of the game, I can make the game actually work. Good GM praxis shouldn't be just wishful thinking but actual rules of the game instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443091/#Comment_443091" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-22T07:49:06+00:00" title="February 22, 2015  7:49AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run into the "you rolled really low so you get humiliated" thing a lot before even in systems where there is explicitly no degree-of-failure rules or worse, degree of failure rules that explicitly don't say that.<br/><br/>I've often had people dejectedly announce "that's a double botch" in World of Darkness games when that actually does not make any probabilistic sense and doesn't exist in any World of Darkness system ever published. <br/><br/>I think people look for "big deals" in-fiction to come of perceived probability outliers, and we often have really bad "probability sense".

Subtraction is usually fine, but surprisingly takes a bit more mental work when you have the possibility of negatives. But that depends on the size of the numbers involved... actually size of the numbers is a big deal, I'd say anything over 10 is a step up in perceived complexity, and going over 20 is too (note how English and many other languages has a special one-word name for each number until 21); beyond that numbers don't feel more complex until &gt; 100.<br/><br/>But the much more important factor in intimidating dice rolls is the number of steps involved. If you have to know which die type or how many to roll, that's a step; if you have to know what to add to it, multiply it by, etc, that's a step (ie, multiplying 2D6 is 1 step; adding a D6 to your modifier, that's 2 steps, since you have to know your modifier).<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is, having to remember 4 steps is <i>way</i> more intimidating than 3 steps, etc. Each step you eliminate interrupts people's thoughts less. (Still referring to people new to a system, of course.) Each step you make identical every time helps too. And any number you put right in front of people rather than allowing any uncertainty.\n<blockquote>I think people look for "big deals" in-fiction to come of perceived probability outliers, and we often have really bad "probability sense".</blockquote>\nWise words indeed. In fact I've nearly noticed this in the past but written it off: I sort of figured it was deliberate. Fiction isn't about everyday happenings, so it makes some sense for it to be biased toward extraordinary success and extraordinary failure. But really, your explanation fits much better with the behavior I've seen. On anything bigger than a 1D6 roll, people will tend to think of the high and low as amazing improbabilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443104/#Comment_443104" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-22T16:20:30+00:00" title="February 22, 2015  4:20PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>JDCorley, it looks like you understand the issue perfectly.

I'm making it a point of forcing myself to describe low rolls in a better light too. It's not that the character misses, but that the enemy is really lucky, or that while his/her aim was true the opponent managed to read the attack and skillfully avoid it.<br/><br/>I've got to admit that I'm forcing myself a bit sometimes because I learned to play the other way and it's terribly easy to fall into the temptation of making a bit of fun of the situation, specially when no harm is done and the player is actually able to laugh at him/herself a little. At least I don't keep pushing it further than a couple of jokes at top, but again, it shouldn't be me making those jokes, but the player when and if he/she feels totally comfortable with it. Bad habits die hard, but it's worth to try and kill them.<br/><br/>Agreed that the number of steps are more intimidating that their nature. Let me see, If I use the 3d6+bonuses and crit table, the hole procedure would be:<br/><br/>-GM asks for a roll of a specific skill or attribute, player finds it on his character sheet and rolls as much dice as it says. 3d6 top.<br/>-Adds the dice together with the proper bonuses.<br/>-Tells the result to the GM who compares it to the TN.<br/>-If there are doubles or triples, the player gets to choose an effect or two from the critical table.<br/>-Damage is fixed, armour or other defenses reduce it. GM calculates this part.<br/><br/>That's doable for me, not too much complex and allows bonuses for up to +20. This critical table is something I've tested before and I love it how it turns the fight into something interesting even if the players just go describing their actions with something just like "I hit it with my sword"<br/><br/>For me, bell curve is the way to go. Having a better chance to roll just enough to make it,  a slimmer chance to roll low and the (perceived though not real) same usual chance to roll a crit do wonders for me. This is another reason I prefer 1d6 before this, but again, I need to be able to reward the players more often with items that pump up their bonuses, since this is  practically a central theme for MMORPGs                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443152/#Comment_443152" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-23T22:59:31+00:00" title="February 23, 2015 10:59PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2015 3:13PM by BeePeeGee.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Generally, bell-curve is more <i>predictable</i>, if you like/need that.</blockquote>\nI don\u2019t really see a difference in predictability either.

I'll have to write a ticket.<br/><br/>A 7+ on 2d6 happens 21/36th of the time, the same range on D66 (1d36) would be 34 or higher.  The key difference is that the bonus or penalty to the rolls are different.  For a D66 roll, each +/- is roughly a shift of 3% flat.  For a bell curve, the smaller number starts off with a bigger boost in range.

I always thought that rolling 2 dice and adding them together is the reason of the bell curve, since there are higher chances that the sum would be the double of an average of the two dice. But I haven't sleep well yesterday, so perhaps I'm the one to blame.<br/><br/>Anyway, What I came up with yesterday (and part of the reason I didin't sleep well) was something like this:<br/><br/>Attributes would be old Str, Dex, Con, Int, Perception (only change here so far) and Cha<br/>Players distribute +1, +2 and +3 for three of them and all the rest are +0. However in game these can grow up to +20.<br/><br/>Skills, equipment and special powers would be Traits, defined by the players and usable with any attributes relevant to the situation. Traits doesn't have a range, however depending on the level they are trained they will give extra dice.<br/><br/>For easy challenges, if the player has a trait and/or if the called attribute is higher than the Target Number, there's no need to roll.<br/><br/>For untrained or barely applicable traits, these give only 1d6 + attribute.<br/>For trained traits, 2d6 + attribute<br/>For veteran status traits, 3d6 + attribute<br/>Traits can go higher, by giving bonus dice (up to three, so players can roll six dice and keep the 3 highest)<br/><br/>When combining traits, players get the bigger amount of dice from one trait only (the best one). When helping, two or more players can roll their dice and keep the 3 highest (or less).<br/><br/>Damage is a fixed value, modified by the applicable attribute.<br/><br/>Buff spells or items allow re-rolls based on the level of the trait used. Debuffs do the same by forcing the opponent to keep the lower rolls.<br/><br/>Doubles allow for a "stunt" as in Dragon Age, so on the best case you could combine two stunts if you roll a triple. There will be a table for players to choose from and combine effects according to the situation.<br/><br/>I'll definitely won't go for the exploding die, since it has not much meaning in this system to keep adding dice to the roll. Maaaybe for the first levels, but again, I think it would be too much trouble.<br/><br/>That's it so far, the rest that kept me awake was rewriting the introduction and the method for world creation anyway :P any thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443197/#Comment_443197" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T19:26:35+00:00" title="February 24, 2015  7:26PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm afraid I don't get your math either 2097.

Saving rolls against death did the trick. <br/><br/>It was just the second combat with this system for the players (an maybe my 6th one with it as well) but I really enjoyed it. Players too, though some admitted that these goblins were harder than they expected. Players rolled low at the start of the fight and I've seen some reviews where the party was wiped out in a similar encounter, so I think we all did okay. The playstyle I want to use now is just like this, a bit more "dangerous" for the PCs, though I'm not really in for the killing, I'm just trying to be fair with the game math and mechanics and it's doing a fine job for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443201/#Comment_443201" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T20:20:47+00:00" title="February 24, 2015  8:20PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2015 8:21PM by BeePeeGee.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Math police here, I'm afraid you're in violation of the law of probability.

When players roll low in my games, their characters don't suck; it's just that their enemies are a bit better, or maybe just lucky. They don't just miss, but something interesting happens (they could even actually succeed but something turns that success into a complication instead of solving a problem. TN doesn't matter too much for me, I'm usually going for the average difficulty or one that makes the action a bit more risky (like +3 or +4 more difficult) when the player's plans look more fragile. I let as much as I can happen without any rolls, so players actually get 98% winning chances and 60% chances that something interesting happens, even while the math says that at top level they have 50% chances to lose, which I really seldom apply in full force.<br/><br/>I believe that If I explain my way of interpretating the dice and make it an integral part of the system instead of just puting it down at the "good advice for GMs" chapter of the game, I can make the game actually work. Good GM praxis shouldn't be just wishful thinking but actual rules of the game instead.</blockquote>\nso this goes with my way of interpretating the dice roll, otherwise my group of players would be leaving the group or powergaming and argumenting a lot to make their bonuses matter. But as I state again, it's something not only I don't reccomend but something that I'm trying hard to avoid in recent times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443235/#Comment_443235" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T09:32:26+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  9:32AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2015 1:59PM by BeePeeGee.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443239/#Comment_443239" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T12:51:25+00:00" title="February 25, 2015 12:51PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443242/#Comment_443242" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T15:34:11+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  3:34PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I do not want a ticket!!!!! <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/></blockquote>\nHeh, looks like I was talking D66 and you were talking 1d36.
