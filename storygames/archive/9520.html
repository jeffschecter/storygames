One of my gaming groups had a player leave the game because they aren't getting what they want from Burning Wheel.  I was getting exactly what I want from that same game, and I had a moment of disconnect because I realized at that point how different our tastes were. <br><br>I'm beginning to see it happen with another player as well.  He has mentioned more than a few times he finds Burning Wheel "exhausting".  Again, I feel a disconnect between myself and that person, because I find that the exact same system to be incredibly energizing and invigorating. <br><br>I find that in my social circles there are a lot of unspoken social rules that can make it quite difficult to pick and choose players. If you pick person A, then you have to exclude/include person B or person A won't play.  That sort of stuff.  <br/><br/>Anyhow, it got me thinking, and thank you for that, good sir!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211326/#Comment_211326" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T09:35:40+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  9:35AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2009 9:36AM by Ry.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Said by: Ogre</cite>"You just roleplay it out!"

I used to worry about making numbers or being inclusive, with game descriptions. Now, I don't pull punches: I tell exactly what sorts of game type it is, what maturity level I require (if I do), and the overarching themes it will address with my expectations for how they will be dealt with by the players. it might (might, rarely) cost me a participant or two, but I have FAR more satisfying play experiences, now, by being direct (and even a bit forceful).<br/><br/>And unless there's money involved (i.e. Gen Con), it's totally OK to say, "OK, man, I think that's enough. thanks for trying, but I think you're hurting the game and I'd like you to leave." After a significant glance (or brushing aside) or some other relatively face-saving way of expressing impropriety. But that's SO rare, now that folks know what experience I am trying to deliver (because of my descriptions). In short: the same social contract stuff you closed with, come to think of it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think there's a common misconception that GMs at cons are some kind of service provider. It's for the best if newcomers are disabused of that notion promptly and firmly.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm sure you realize all this. I guess I just wanted to encourage you to run more at cons--if nothing else, to offer more than d20/D&amp;D to the first-timers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211635/#Comment_211635" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T11:10:35+00:00" title="June 11, 2009 11:10AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not that I'm trying to push anything, but it seems that Trail of Cthulhu may answer some of the problems you guys have with Call of Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211681/#Comment_211681" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T13:20:52+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  1:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Clint, I enjoyed this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211705/#Comment_211705" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T14:10:24+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  2:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 2:13PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, perhaps the best episode of SC yet.

He's best rambly.<br/><br/>Favorite quote: "you very gamely, you know, you went at a nice, relaxed, kind of a hundred-and-five percent while you demonstrated the move.
