It's all to do with how the dice work, and I think I've got a good answer for it, but I want to see what others think.<br/><br/>Background: The Boy and The Girl is an Apocalypse World hack that's set in a fairy tale fantasy setting. It's a two player game - one player, one GM - and it emulates the "children out in the world on an adventure that's bigger than them" quest (or more broadly, "unlikely heroes on an epic saga"). The player plays the part of a young goblin (The Boy) of maybe 6 years of age who's been outcast from his tribe for not being a very good goblin (not evil and horrible enough). For reasons all his own, The Boy decides to embark on a grand quest: the Demon King who rules over all of goblin-kind has kidnapped a princess (The Girl) from another dimension, using her innate power to open up a portal and bring forth vast legions of hellspawn from realms unspeakable. He's just about to sacrifice her when The Boy shows up and rescues her, and that's where the game picks up. You're on the run, trying to get The Girl back home.<br/><br/>In order to do so, you have to find twelve horrific monsters scattered across the vast world, each holding a piece of the Demon King's soul. Defeat them all, and you can take on the Demon King himself. Unfortunately for you, he's gathered the entirety of the goblin nation to chase you down.<br/><br/>The playtest is here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwQFfBABRn2BeFJVZUtJbmhSc0NWY0RrbVVnQnhaQQ" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwQFfBABRn2BeFJVZUtJbmhSc0NWY0RrbVVnQnhaQQ</a><br/><br/>You can find a character sheet and a move sheet here. A GM sheet is forthcoming!<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwQFfBABRn2BRm9DamM3SmZUWENISnBuQ0I2dEZuUQ/edit" rel="nofollow">Moves</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwQFfBABRn2BejJBdFpUR0dSN2FuRDJmenJ2a2JLdw/edit" rel="nofollow">character sheet</a>.<br/><br/>Okay, but back to the problem.<br/><br/>You'll see how the dice work here - roll a white d4, d6, or d8, against an opposing black d6. Whoever rolls highest wins. In addition, if your white die rolls highest, different effects happen depending on what you've rolled. The problem is I can't figure out how to make the d4 not be a blight on the whole thing. As it stands, the d4 is a weakness, which is fine, but it doesn't give the player the chance of reaching the higher tiers during rolling like the d6 and d8 can. I want it to be able to do that, just with poor frequency. My current idea is to change the tiers around a little:<br/><br/>Instead of a white 1-3, it's a white 1-2.<br/>Instead of a white 4-5, it's a white 3-4.<br/>Instead of a white 6+, it's a white 5+.<br/><br/>Since the lower sized die gets a +1 to it, this allows you, if you're lucky, to hit a 4, add +1 to it, and get a 5, which makes the d4 do what I want. But I'm floating around other suggestions too, so I don't know exactly what's going to happen. I'd appreciate input on this! I was also told the +1 can cause some slight problems with the system, and if I end up dropping that, it's back to square one with this d4 business.<br/><br/>Anyway, take a look, playtest, offer opinions, anything!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365929/#Comment_365929" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T08:48:32+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  8:48AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just skimmed your rules, but I know that in Apocalypse World, you usually get to make a choice if you roll less than optimally. It's nice, because it takes a bit of the sting out of conditional success. <br/><br/>Is there a currency in your game that I can spend besides which dice I choose? For example, can I bank points to spend in emergencies that might lift my results on a d4 to a higher tier? <br/><br/><br/>I haven't played your game, but from looking at the math, I am a little concerned that my attempts to do things will be decided by very random rolls. It's great to have unexpected consequences to force us to create more interesting fiction, but on the opposite end is a sense of powerlessness to effect the world. AW uses 2d6 so that the results better resemble a bell curve and you can manage your holds and +1's a bit better. <br/><br/>Did you decide to have a more random, less choice model since this game is for two players?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots" title="amazingrobots"><img alt="amazingrobots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots">amazingrobots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365934/#Comment_365934" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T09:07:40+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's currency in the form of Fate points, gained from a 5+ roll, that you can use to raise the size of your die in a given roll. They don't, as of now, allow you to raise the result of what you rolled to a different tier, but I can definitely see the utility in that.<br/><br/>I actually tried to design them to be open and broad on all levels. Hearing that it seems just the opposite is distressing!

As long as the black die doesn't become a d8, there's a chance, even for a white d4 to reach the high category.  But I didn't read your whole thing, so there might be stuff that gets borked by this solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
