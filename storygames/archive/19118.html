Various suggestions have been helpfully tendered by various folks as to how I can attempt to change hearts and minds, and reading them through and responding to them it occurs to me that before we start choosing games to wean people away from playstyle x to playstyle y we need to uncover what the different types of players' wants and expectations are, and then cater to them while at the same time attempting to subtly move them in a different direction. Obviously, all trad gamers don't have one set of wants and expectations, and neither do all indie gamers, but I think we could usefully isolate some commonalities, forex from my pov the preponderance of trad gamers like cooperative player party dynamics and clearly defined session objectives, even if there are freeform elements within the overall session, story arc or campaign, and a way of optimising their character's ability to defeat the bad guys by a careful and calculated distribution of skill points. <br/><br/>What, on the whole, do indie gamers want? Well, for me, player-generated content, emotional content and some degree of introspective philosophising (and no I can't really define that), a strong narrative, and hard emotional choices. Oh, and a GM who is more of an overseer than manipulator of the game world. Do other people feel the same, or do y'all have completely different wants and expectations from a game than the ones I've outlined above?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426722/#Comment_426722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T19:27:15+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  7:27PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Catty,<br/><br/>I'm with you on most of these.

If no one at your group wants to play story games you're not going to "change hearts and minds" or "wean people away" or "subtly move them". Those are all rather negative ways to express the fact that you want to play a different style of game. Have you thought of simply playing story games with different people rather than trying to manipulate them? Or playing online with story gamers?<br/><br/>You can't change what people want out of gaming, and you can't manipulate them into the style of play you'd prefer. Offer to run or facilitate a story game for your group. If they bite, go for it. Try your best to make it a fun an exciting game tailored to your group in a way that only you can pull off.<br/><br/>I tried something similar recently, less manipulative and more straight forward about it all, but it didn't work. At all. Set up: We played 4th Edition D&amp;D for a year and a half and recently switched to Pathfinder. These are all older 40s+ gamers who are traditional as can be. Of the players only two of us have played much outside of D&amp;D. Not traditional games. But actual D&amp;D. Since high school. In the early 80s.<br/><br/>I talked up a dozen story games and non-traditional games without a hint of response. I listened and talked to them over a year and a half about various games, mechanics, rules, quibbles, etc. The other guy who'd played other games was on board from square one. The other three, not so much. There was an issue with the DM not being able to make it so I jumped and ran a game of Fate Accelerated for them. I'm not a terrible GM, but I'm not amazing either. I pointed out ways they could do things D&amp;D simply couldn't handle, character concepts that were too odd or way too involved to pull of well in a rules heavy game. They bit and we played.<br/><br/>One player said he finally got what the hell I was talking about all those months. Win. But it was a failure for "converting them". They spent more time arguing about how the rules were stupid and wrong than actually playing, to say nothing of their dogged refusal to role-play. "What, no flanking?" "What the fuck is a 'zone'? I move six squares." "Can't you just ask for a perception check?" "How many spells do I have?" "What level are we?" "Who's playing the cleric? I don't want a TPK on our first try." "How many hit points do I have?"<br/><br/>Short version: Don't manipulate your group into playing games they don't want to. Find a different group for story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426750/#Comment_426750" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T00:27:56+00:00" title="January  7, 2014 12:27AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You can't change what people want out of gaming, </blockquote>\nThis seems pretty unlikely, unless you are suggesting that a) people always and forever only want one thing or set of things out of gaming or b) the only way that what people want out of gaming ever changes is through introspection, and moreover c) that introspection is not based at all on their experiences with other people.<br/><br/>It's certainly true that there are better and worse and more or less fruitful ways to try and change what people want out of gaming, but people definitely change their gaming habits and that definitely happens in part because of what the people around them do. There are lots of people whose gaming habits are quite flexible or responsive, and everybody's habits are limited/formed in part by what sort of games and people and styles of play they have been exposed to.<br/><br/>Anyways, it's a bit nit-picky, because I agree that you shouldn't manipulate people into doing things without some buy-in on their part, and it is often easier to simply play different games with different people. But sometimes the people you are playing with are people you want to play other games with too, and sometimes they will actually really like those games if they try them.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>As for the original question, I'm with JD, pretty much. It's an especially strange question because unless you are writing a game or maybe running a convention for this purpose, you are almost never going to be dealing with more than a dozen or so individual players. It seems like it will be far more effective to just figure out what those dozen or so individual players want or expect from the games they play, and use that to inform whatever you're doing. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings" title="SGTillings"><img alt="SGTillings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings">SGTillings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426759/#Comment_426759" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T06:23:22+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  6:23AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, as basically as I can put it, the main divide between Trad gamers and Story gamers is the role of failure in their respective games. From a young age with games of other natures (chess ect.) we are taught that failure is an absolute state, Trad games build on this by having that same sentiment but also interjecting 'but you can try again?'. Indie (or story) games on the other hand take failure as part and parcel of essential happenings. Different expectations of narrative control are also big part of it, when you are playing in a trad game the GM will be asking the players 'How are you acting in MY world' whereas story games it is more like 'How do your action effect THE world', the loss of firm control on both parts of a story game is part of the fun and makes more interesting things happen. <br/><br/>I think a lot of Trad gamers are averse to story gaming because the stories tend to be smaller and seem far less interesting. Take a Fiasco setting like the one in suburbia (I can't remember the name right now), anyone who has played it can tell you that it developed into it's own interesting and sometimes hilarious story but a person who is versed in trad gaming would ask 'Why should I play that when I can play a massive part in a story about the fate of the world?'. I believe that is the main problem, the idea of the scale of the importance of the world. <br/><br/>I would say introducing the idea of failure being interesting and fun and leading to better things subtly into games and also introducing the idea of smaller scale games. <br/>I also find people who are far less interested in combat tend to gravitate toward story gaming so look out for that? <br/>I dunno, I'm just rambling sorry! <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426764/#Comment_426764" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T07:02:18+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  7:02AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2014 7:18AM by catty_big.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote> Obviously, all trad gamers don't have one set of wants and expectations, and neither do all indie gamers, but I think we could usefully isolate some commonalities, </blockquote>You are wrong, happy to help.</blockquote>\n1.

Ok sure, it probably didn't happen as suddenly as that, but how gradual was the process, and what games did you initially pick as being more suitable in the sense of their being 'less work', and how did you feel when you started running them?<br/><br/>Secondly, implicit in that statement I think is a common expectation of trad gamers (and trad GMs) that the GM does a lot of the 'work' (including both pre-game prep and game management and narrating/reacting to players' actions), which is in stark contrast to the indie GM (or facilitator) who comparatively does very little work as the players are kind of expected to pitch in a great deal more.

When it's facilitated by the rules, I'd call that difference "indie."<br/><br/>Imagine you're watching a good film like the Matrix. I like the kung fu, but I think what really makes it buzz are character beats. For example:\n<ul>\n<li>Neo's choice to follow the white rabbit.</li>\n<li>Neo taking the ledge to escape, followed by his surrender to the agents.</li>\n<li>Neo choosing the red pill.</li>\n<li>Cipher's betrayal.</li>\n<li>Morpheus' decision to sacrifice himself for Neo.</li>\n<li>Neo choosing to risk his life to rescue Morpheus even though the Oracle said he isn't the One.</li>\n<li>Neo turning to fight the Agent.</li>\n<li>Morpheus delaying the EMP to give Neo a chance</li>\n</ul>\n... these are all places where the character makes a choice, and those choices define what sort of person they are.<br/><br/>Compare this to a typical Stephan Segal movie:\n<ul>\n<li>Segal has some really cool past, but is now a loner. He meets a girl</li>\n<li>Bad things happen to her</li>\n<li>Fight</li>\n<li>Fight</li>\n<li>Fight</li>\n<li>Big boss</li>\n<li>Victory and kisses</li>\n</ul>\n... Apart from his decision to fight, none of these are really character beats. It's more like watching a skier tackle increasingly difficult runs so we can watch their skill.<br/><br/>Likewise consider my experiences of a typical low-level D&amp;D session played OSR style in a dungeon:\n<ul>\n<li>Make character</li>\n<li>Briefed in a pub. We all know I'm going to accept the dungeon delve.</li>\n<li>Fight</li>\n<li>Fight</li>\n<li>Die randomly. Make new character</li>\n<li>Fight</li>\n<li>Fight</li>\n<li>Big boss</li>\n<li>Count money</li>\n</ul>\nNow, I have a lot of fond memories with D&amp;D, but played OSR style, it's again like watching a skier tackle increasingly more difficult runs.<br/><br/>Of course, you can get more of the first type of experience in D&amp;D, too, but I think that's added by the players and not addressed particularly in the rules. So, to the degree a game facilitates character beats rather than task based success, I would tend to call it indie. And those times I'm looking for an indie experience, I'm looking for a game that delivers something with more character beats as part of the rules.<br/><br/>I.e. I'm looking for a game more focused on what sort of person my character is, rather than how skilled they are.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426793/#Comment_426793" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T12:07:07+00:00" title="January  7, 2014 12:07PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This, here, is really key:\n<blockquote><br/>I also find people who are far less interested in combat tend to gravitate toward story gaming so look out for that?  <br/></blockquote>\nThis is definitely a defining feature of the "indie" design trend, and most people who show an interest in "indie" gaming have something to say about this.<br/><br/>The "trad" game tradition (heh) is heavily focused on combat and character upgrades related to combat effectiveness. It sticks pretty closely to the adventure/combat/wargame model (with some notable exceptions, of course). The "indie" game canon, however, has a huge variety of games, many of which deal with themes that have nothing to do with combat whatsoever.<br/><br/>I can't remember the number of times I've heard a "trad" gamer tell me in no uncertain terms that you simply can't have roleplaying without combat (in one instance, "An RPG without combat is like a pizza without grease! What's the point?").<br/><br/>That may be the single best avenue of attack to identifying or attracting gamers interested in "indie"-style games, with "GM burnout" being a close second, and "players frustrated with endless railroading" a distant third.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426797/#Comment_426797" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T14:38:10+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  2:38PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You are wrong, happy to help.</blockquote>\nI think the presentation of this response may obscure its essential truth and wisdom.<br/><br/>Which is that no amount of theorizing and plotting and understanding and matrices of commonalities will bring you any closer to what you want, which is to play the kinds of games you dig with the people in your gaming community. <br/><br/>Your only possible recourse is to pick up a cool game that you like, go down to the clubhouse, pitch your game in a way that interests at least two other people, and play it with them.<br/><br/>Odds are you'll find some players who like that game too.

People who like trad games should like some of these elements, I think.<br/><br/>Story games have a storyteller's modus operandi (you try to tell an interesting story) and a relatively simple system that emulates a certain type of story. Storygamers like this stuff, don't we?<br/><br/>For me the biggest draw in story-games was a simple system, the other big draw was that I didn't need to try to win all the time. I never liked the complexity of trad games. Also, I felt players had much more choices, they didn't even try to form a group consensus all the time.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426814/#Comment_426814" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T17:08:15+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  5:08PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2014 5:17PM by Rickard.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't we just describe what we want from a specific style of gaming?

I like playing <b>D&amp;D4</b> as a boardgame. I like intrigues between the players. I like games like <b>The Resistance</b> and <b>Diplomacy</b>. (Why aren't they roleplaying games?)<br/><br/>I like exploration. Hexcrawl could be fun. Seeing where a story is heading is fun. Unraveling a mystery is fun. Learning culture is fun. Seeing how components of a game interact, may it be story elements, game mechanics or even the participants themselves. All that is fun too. (Isn't fun an emotional response to learning?)<br/><br/>Oh, and all this can be summarized as <i>exploration</i>, <i>competition</i>, <i>expression</i> and <i>sensation</i> in various degrees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426815/#Comment_426815" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T17:28:35+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  5:28PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In  fairness, I like adventurous, combat heavy stuff, even in dirty-hippy games, and sometimes (often) like the way it is handled mechanically by them better than more mainstream/trad design options.<br/><br/>(Recently heard someone talking about something similar, using the terms "process simulation" contrasting it with "outcome simulation", or something like that.

Thus my trad roots are definitely in the "anything but D&amp;D" camp. WW never really appealed either. Then I basically gave up on rpgs in the late 90s to spend a decade wargaming. As that was coming to an end I found Mythic GME recommended as a narrative campaign system. It tempted me into trying a CoC game using it. Then I found Diaspora/FATE. Then SG and every 2nd post was about AW so I crumbled and it's been all down-hill into SG from there (see later though). Another feature is that my children are now old enough to play rpgs and are interested to play.<br/>So I actually play quite a lot now and mainly SG but we also do some trad games mainly via Mythic GME so there is no prep and it is more collaborative. Also I'm enjoying OSR stuff and seeing what D&amp;D was designed to do, which we only got about half right back in the day. <br/><br/>I have some quite trad players in my groups but I am always happy to kill off games quickly, especially if people aren't having fun. Hence we all know that something else is coming up soon. There are basically too many games to play these days so I don't see this as a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426898/#Comment_426898" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-09T09:23:55+00:00" title="January  9, 2014  9:23AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I dont think trying to target a game for what the vague groups we've tagged as indie and trad is a worthwhile endeavor.

Some of those people might find alternative games more suited to them, but I have to suspect that's a rather small subset.<br/><br/>How gamers with a long history of "trad" games migrated away is an easy story. In the beginning, there was D&amp;D. Even most of the early alternatives to D&amp;D were clearly very derived from D&amp;D. I mean, I quickly migrated away from D&amp;D, and was always playing different games. But Palladium and Shadowrun and Warhammer Fantasy all clearly share roots with D&amp;D. There certainly were some early examples of "story" games (Tales from the Floating Vagabond and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen for example), but for the most different playstyles were realized by playing "trad" games in different ways. As games continued to evolve and diverge, gamers could more easily split into different games that suited what they were looking for.<br/><br/>I will also say I'm an omnigamer. I have four semi-regular campaigns I play in. All of those would be firmly categorized as traditional games. I also enjoy lighter one-shot games for those times we get together and don't have something planned. I can pull out Fiasco or Durance or Dread and get a game going very quickly. Or sometimes I'll have a specific game I want to run for a single session. I also find I can make my traditional games better by bringing in story game techniques. Apocalypse World is a manifesto about making failure interesting. Durance is a treatise on scene framing.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling. It's hard to categorize either games or gamers into such binary groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426906/#Comment_426906" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-09T11:22:52+00:00" title="January  9, 2014 11:22AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2014 12:01PM by WarriorMonk.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only three kind of people can change from trad player to story player:<br/>-GMs who are burned out of trad GMing<br/>-Players who had enough bad experiences with trad games (inconsistent, illogic rules, playing in dysfunctional groups whenever theyr tried trads, railroading, GMs in love with their mary sue's etc)<br/>-Players and GMs used to switch from one game to the other at least once a year.<br/><br/>Find out if the majority of people in your group belongs to any fo these.

And yes, pointing the good points in indie games might be the difference, but you've got to realize <i>most trad gamers are comfortable playing trad</i> and even with the best reasoning, logic, good intentions and better arguments, you just won't be able to make them move of their own volition into indie games. <br/><br/>Yes, you can be as stubborn as them or manipulate them into playing indies until they like them, and you'll probably be doing a lot of good for them, but don't expect to find enough logical arguments to convince a person to go out of their comfort zone. 99% of the time, people will tend to act on their own feelings, disregarding all kind of logic, and worse, by finding excuses and logical justifications for their acts. Or even worse, by just saying no in a more or less passive way (like trying it just to shut you up and then ruin the experience so you don't try to pull that on them again.<br/><br/>So save your time, only the three kind of people listed above will change from trad gamers into indie gamers happily and by their own provided with a good choice and the proper logical arguments. Less stubborn players might give it a chance and others will try it as said, only to shut you up. Some will concede after finding group pressure against them, newcomers will most probaly be quite interested and definitely everyone will love indie games, providing they learn how to play and enjoy them properly, and that the chosen game/setting fits their personal tastes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426919/#Comment_426919" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-09T12:49:09+00:00" title="January  9, 2014 12:49PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2014 12:53PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited to remove unhelpful "not all indie games are the same" post.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deinol" title="deinol"><img alt="deinol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deinol">deinol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426921/#Comment_426921" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-09T13:06:12+00:00" title="January  9, 2014  1:06PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [There's a reason I've been using the term Story Games instead of Indie Games.]<br/><br/>The Play on Target podcast just did an episode about pitching games to groups. One of the things they said was to pitch the game idea and leave out the game system. Once the game idea is selected and invested in, tell them what system you want to run it in. If they really object to system, you can then negotiate another system for the same game idea that'll work for everyone. This of course doesn't work for every pitch, but I've found many campaigns could be expressed using different systems.<br/><br/>Although a question for the original poster. What length of game are you looking for? Are you wanting a group to play different one-shots every week? Short limited run campaigns? Or long term campaigns? Because if your local gamers prefer trad games for the long-term campaign form, that'll be harder to switch them to alternating Fiasco and other short games. It might be easier to pitch them on a long *World style campaign, which has some of the deeper character investment in common with a traditional campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426930/#Comment_426930" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-09T16:11:05+00:00" title="January  9, 2014  4:11PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>ICE, Although It may look otherwise, I'm quite serious about the post I made. </blockquote>\nThat doesn't make it any less parodical.<br/><br/>I mean seriously.

And I think SGTillings and deinol are correct in saying that the disctinction is not 'trad' and 'indie' (Yes JD, I'm coming round to your way of thinking on that!) but 'tactical' games (probably not a satisfactory label either, but still) and storygames. But I think one of the things that the Forge and the Indie explosion of ten or so years ago did was blast the idea that RPGs were one monolithic thing that had very clearly defined characterisctics, in the same way that in the late 70s- here in the UK at any rate- Punk showed us that we didn't have to only have four blokes playing guitars and all looking more or less alike.<br/><br/>It's also possible that what we're now witnessing is the <i>synthesis</i> of the Hegelian <i>thesis</i>, <i>antithesis</i>, <i>synthesis</i> paradigm, where the <i>thesis</i> was D&amp;D and its clones, and the <i>antithesis</i> all the hippy weirdassery of the early 2000s that drew so much fire from the Old Guard, and sent John Tarnovsky and others into such severe apoplectic fits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426955/#Comment_426955" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-10T09:45:32+00:00" title="January 10, 2014  9:45AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes catty_big, the easiest way to push the terms problem out of the way is "D&amp;D, clones and retroclones=trad" so I readed your initial question (after reading that "the folks at my club would on the whole far rather endlessly play trad games" part) more like "How do you get hardcore trad players to interest in other games?"<br/><br/>So I went straight to the short version answer, based on a few assumptions. Of course in general there are other ways to convince other kind of people about playing different games, not everything is white and black and different arguments will work for different people on diferent conditions, and even if you consider all variables, people may still surprise you and try something out on their own volition in a way that will make you look at them as if they have been posessed by the very spirit of indie games (Vincent? Eero? I dunno)<br/><br/>But then again, these are trad gamers we're talking about (here my first assumption), and by catty_big's description they have been playing them for quite a long time and show no signs of burning out. And convincing them of trying other things has proven to be such a difficult task that catty_big started not one, but two threads on the subject, which tells me he's meeting some stubborn resistance or has seen it before from this people and knows that no half-assed argument will convince them. (that's like three more assumptions on this pharagraph alone)<br/><br/>And come on, we're talking about games, not a matter of life and death, so I can't help but picture we're talking about players that despite that may be completely succesfull and fullfilled persons in other aspects of their life (I'm assuming the best case scenario here for courtesy, but I seriously doubt we're talking of dysfunctional players, nor I'll consider them disfunctional in any other way <i>a priori</i>), have nonetheless stick to a single way of playing RPGs and won't step out of that confort zone unless you promise and deliver them dicefull/diceless fun heaven on a tabletop game.<br/><br/>Well, I know a few people who are like this, you all probably know more people like this than me, and if so you'll know as well as me that those people are happy playing trad, you can perfectly enjoy playing trad with them and that's it, since no power on earth or heaven may be enough to make them at least curious about other kind of games outside their comfort zone (ok, I admit I'm full of assumptions but bite me if I'm wrong in this case). So all the advice I can give you there is just let them be, play trads with them and have fun. And go look somewhere else for indie fun.<br/><br/>Of course, if the majority of the group is composed by any of the types I described above, you will have an statistically higher chance of convincing them to try any other game.<br/><br/>It's impossible to convince an hypothetical truly sttuborn hardcore trad gamer to play dirty hippie indie games? no, it's just statistically unlikeable. How? well, the answer depends on what they have tried before, other tastes and interests they may have, how deep and caring is your relationship with these people, what do they understand for concessions and how prone they are to give them, the degree of curiosity they may develop and how good you're selling game pitches, among a couple tons of other stuff; which I'd prefer not to go into, unless you really can't find other players to share your other interests with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426962/#Comment_426962" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-10T12:00:34+00:00" title="January 10, 2014 12:00PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think WM's third point actually addresses Crunch and ICE's suggestion: if the group isn't already trying new games of any kind at least once a year probably they don't want to play new games, and if they are, then they probably do.</blockquote>\nBut there always has to be SOME POINT in the sequence where they have not yet done this, for them to have eventually done it.<br/><br/>Anyways, whatever -- apparently this whole time we were only talking about a nebulous subset of 'hardcore trad gamers', so when we use phrases like 'the only way' it is not actually logically indefensible, just a matter of circular definition.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426992/#Comment_426992" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-10T21:14:35+00:00" title="January 10, 2014  9:14PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2014 9:16PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To underscore the "problem terminology" issue:<blockquote>"D&amp;D, clones and retroclones=trad"</blockquote>In my lexicon, "retro" (including retroclones) is "Old School", not "Trad".

When D&amp;D first came out there was nothing traditional about it. It was a very, very new concept. I have always seen RPGs in that light.<br/><br/>That being said, I do see the distinction between old school games and their focus on simulation, and the new breed of games that focus on story. For myself, that is where I look for deciding who among the players I know might want to try out a new story driven RPG with me. If their personal enjoyment comes more from simulation I acknowledge that and roll with it.

I really enjoy both the high fantasy high tactical gamist romps in D&amp;D 4th and the more overarching story-view of Microscope. On the other hand, a game like, say, Grey Ranks doesn't appeal to me so much. In this case, there are likely too few steps removed between the game and the issues it deals with for it to be an appealing way for me to spend a few hours.<br/><br/>So basically, there are different people that, I think, look for different things from games. Folks that want character immersion are unlikely to find it in some story games. People who look for story awareness will likely not find it in D&amp;D. But some folks might be looking for more nebulous things that exist in the region around RPGs in general. So the best way to find out if folks might be open to whatever you want to play is ask them on an individual level rather than try and form categories.<br/>With regards to bringing trad and story gamers together (Using the very rough definitions I have seen in this thread so far...) with a single game they can both enjoy for different reasons, I have found 13th Age and AW(and associated hacks) to be very good at that indeed. They offer quite a bit of character control, encourage investment in characters too, but also have a focus on group based storytelling, rather than the storyteller role being monopolised by the GM figure.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
