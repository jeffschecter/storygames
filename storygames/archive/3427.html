But it's late Saturday night and I wanted to post about all the awesomeness going on.<br/><br/>First of all, mucho thanks for all the local folks like Tony and Brandon and others for putting this on.  Your hard work is *seriously* appreciated!!  My first time in Seattle and what a cool city!  Nice university location right downtown.<br/><br/>Friday evening I showed up and checked in, and a bunch of us repaired to the <a href="http://www.elysianbrewing.com/" rel="nofollow">Elysian Brewing Company</a> for beers and dinner and more beers.  When we returned to campus, people were already congregating in the lobby downstairs to play some card and board games to whet the appetite.  By the time I was going to bed, <a href="http://havegameswilltravel.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Paul Tevis</a> was running <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/19237" rel="nofollow">Cash 'n Guns</a> and everyone was pointing foam pistols at each other, HK Action-style.  That was a nice wakeup call to the <a href="http://www.episcopalchurch.org/" rel="nofollow">Episcopalian</a> deacons who were staying in the dorms with us!<br/><br/>The next morning after a huge breakfast we all congregated in our assigned gaming rooms to setup games for the day.  There were three official slots (9am, 1pm, 4pm) for three-hour games with breaks in-between.  And some stayed after for some gaming into the night.<br/><br/>In the 9am slot <a href="http://www.durham3.com/" rel="nofollow">Clinton Nixon</a> ran Greg Stolze's game <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/825234" rel="nofollow">Reign</a>, which was a hoot!  The chargen for this game was worth the price of admission alone.  Imagine BW's lifepath system with randomizers.  You roll 10-siders to figure out which important events happened during your character's life up to this point.  So for example, my character had been a petty thief, canny sage, foot soldier, misery merchant, raised wild and a star-crossed lover.  And all of those events had a mechanical benefit in the game, either increasing a stat, a skill or adding some sort of advantage to the character.  But the great part is that me as a player got to take these events and put them in any order I liked to create my character's story, which was *very* empowering!  And once all of the characters were created, we banded together into a "Company" to achieve our goals in the game.  One of the other interesting things about Reign is it's use of Company rules, which simulate large battles between groups, houses, armies, etc.  Basically the scenes that your characters are involved in during a session can add bonuses to a final roll that is made at the end of the session.  So while our Black Hyena bandits were trying to overthrow the Tyrant King, our individual actions were helping the overall goal.<br/><br/>Clinton said this was his first time running the system, but he worked it like a pro and it was a great start to the day.<br/><br/>In the 1pm session I was in Wilhelm's 8-person BW scenario <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads" rel="nofollow">"The Gift"</a>.  Now I had played BW a few times including Luke's demo of "The Sword", but the sheer amount of deadly conflict built into this con scenario was awesome, and Wilhelm kept things moving along.  I played the Dwarven keeper of the treasure room, and the climax of the session was a no-limit Duel of Wits that ended in a tie despite the damned Elves rolling 15 successes for their final Point!!  I have always said that Burning Wheel is a dish best served by someone who knows what the hell they are doing, and Wilhelm kept the game moving along nicely.<br/><br/>Dinner break was a bit early, so supercool local guy and Agon chief <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">John Harper </a> and I walked downtown so I could try the coffee at the much vaunted <a href="http://www.espressovivace.com/" rel="nofollow">Espresso Vivace </a>, which the coed running the front desk at the dorm taught me how to pronounce properly after I butchered the name.  And damn if it wasn't in the Top Three of Best Lattes I Have Ever Had.  A quick bowl of Pho for dinner and we were back on campus for the evening session.<br/><br/>I was finally getting a chance to play <a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html" rel="nofollow">Primetime Adventures</a> which I had read so much about.  I had always heard that getting buy-in on the show concept was key.  And a late GM and disagreements over the setting didn't get things going on the right foot.  But we finally agreed on a TV show about average people who find out that they are actually fairy tale characters.  So we had people like Merlin, Little Red Riding Hood and Peter Pan.<br/><br/>I'm still honestly trying to grasp the scene framing rules and probably wasn't helping the game to run smoothly, but I definitely had fun trying out the system and would like to see it in longer form play.<br/><br/>Whew!  So I am crashing now in prep for Sunday's games.  I'm playing in a playtest of Matt Wilson's <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/GalacticPlaytest/HomePage" rel="nofollow">Galactic</a>.  And who knows what else the day holds.<br/><br/><br/>Any other fun stories from the weekend?  You guys are awesome!!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77299/#Comment_77299" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T01:28:19+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  1:28AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As one of the organizers, I am psyched to see a con report already, and one with such enthusiasm.

The dining schedule in the dorms meant little sleep for Chris, but no matter.<br/><br/>9am session and I was in a playtest of Matt Wilson's Galactic, which was also being recorded for posterity.  I had a really good time with the game, especially the crew generation.  Basically this is a game that is pretty reminiscent of Star Trek where each player is a Captain on their own starship, trying to solve some sort of problem.  But to keep the players engaged during the different scenes, each player takes the role of a crew member on the other Captains' ships.<br/><br/>I took a lot of playtest notes (which I will send to Matt) and had some really nice scenes that would have made James Tiberius proud.<br/><br/>After lunch I played in Clinton's game of <a href="http://www.crngames.com/the_princes_kingdom/" rel="nofollow">The Princes' Kingdom</a>.  We were all a bit torn by this point in the weekend, but how could you say no to running around an island hunting after wolves who were really people?  The seven of us all played princes aged from 5 to 11, and we pretty much bickered constantly as you could imagine.  "No, I *double* dare you!!"<br/><br/>So now I am waiting for the lame shuttle back to the lame airport to go back to my real life.  Why can't I have this much awesomeness every weekend?!  I met so many cool people and got in some sweet gaming.  <br/><br/>And Clinton isn't nearly as scary as he looks on the Durham 3 page.

I played in Tony Dowler's TSOY game, Wilhelm Fitzpatrick (rafial)'s <i>Burning Wheel</i> game, and my husband Edmund (Shosuro Kando)'s <i>Zorcerer of Zo</i> game; and I ran two games of <i>Wilderness of Mirrors</i> that, with the same premise, turned out entirely different.  There was so much cool stuff going on, I couldn't get into all the games I was lusting after, but there are only so many hours in the day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB" title="Matthew_SB"><img alt="Matthew_SB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB">Matthew_SB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77381/#Comment_77381" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T18:39:08+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  6:39PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word.  GPNW was awesome times 23.<br/>\nIn fact, it was more awesome than I could handle, I ran out of juice after session 4 and had to bail.  But I totally had a blast, met a bunch of rocking gamers, and played the hell out of those four games!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Friday dinner at the Elysian was a great way to start the show, kicking off the event in a way that said \xe2\u20ac\u0153this is about the gamers more than the games,\xe2\u20ac\x9d which I thought rocked.  It was loud and rowdy there, but the company was great!<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday kicked off for me with a killer game of Shock.  Two of the other three players were guys I had chatted with the evening before, which was cool.  And the game really popped.  In a world where the rich elite go to a remote clinic for immortality treatments, and mind sharing is common, extremist religion and mind pollution are constant specters.  By the end of the game, my extremist, who tried to stop people from damning their souls with this false immortality, was brain-burned and shipped off to Mars, complete with the immortality treatment required by space travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext Christian ran Beast Hunter, which started off a little shaky but quickly hit an awesome stride.  There was brutal bloody fighting, a foe routed almost entirely by one man\xe2\u20ac\u2122s spiritual power and wild cinematic battles.  A damn good time!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the cap for my evening, Carl ran a brutal Zombies in the Vineyard.  This game was a grim scramble for survival, and at the end of the session all four characters were still in the game.  But my Film School Student had just had the infected bite on his leg removed with a turkey carver and his collapsed lung treated with a knitting needle, all this by Paul Tevis\xe2\u20ac\u2122 housewife in a truly heroic effort to save his life!<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, this morning I enjoyed the Galactic playtest Chris mentions above.  When that wrapped up for lunch, I realized I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have any kick left in me, so I wimped out and headed home, missing the Princes\xe2\u20ac\u2122 Kingdom.  Damn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve not been to a con since \xe2\u20ac\u212289, and gaming with the same 3 dudes for years now.  It really freakin\xe2\u20ac\u2122 rocked to meet so many awesome folks, and to play in such kick-ass games.  Every damn time slot was overloaded with awesome, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re just lucky it didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t collapse into a singularity of ROCK.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlan, Kyle, you guys kicked-ass at the table with me every damn day.  Thank you.<br/>\nRyan, Jonh, that Beast Hunters game was brutal fun!<br/>\nChristian, Carl and Alan, thank you so very much for the games you ran.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony, John, Brandon, Phil, this was a fantastic con.  I hope it was as rewarding for you all.

I consider a game that you think about well after it is over a success and I am still thinking about all the stuff we talked about creating the world in Shock.

I'll probably do an AP post on one or two of the four games I played, but that will have to wait for when I'm not completely exhausted from driving and gaming goodness.  For now:<br/><br/>Games Played: The Mountain Witch, Danger Patrol (SotC hack), A Penny For My Thoughts, Perfect<br/><br/>GMs I didn't get to say goodbye to: Paul Tevis, James Brown.  Thanks for the fun.  Thanks again to Joe McDonald and John Harper too.  You all run a mean game and I really enjoyed playing with you.<br/><br/>Players I didn't get to say goodbye to or learn their "online names": Too damn many.  Holy crud, what great bunch of people!<br/><br/>Thanks so much to all the event organizers.  I don't have much to compare this to other than Dreamation, (a much different beast), but I thought this went off really well.  One nit:  Merging the pre-event wiki "sign-ups" with the white board sign-ups might be a good thing.  I didn't get there until Saturday morning, but there were three events I signed up for on the wiki anywhere from a couple days to a few weeks previous that were full when I got there.  One of them was run a second time later that weekend, so that was cool.  And I got to play something I really enjoyed in each session in any case.  Maybe the pre-event "sign-ups" were meant just for indicating interest and I didn't catch that.<br/> <br/>Nit for me: Next time be prepared to run a couple games - some of the games were pretty full, so it seemed like a couple more GMs might have been needed.  A lot of people showed up to play - maybe more than expected!<br/><br/>So next GPNW... why wait for next June? Let's do this twice a year! :-D  Maybe Portland can host next time.

The turn out has been great, and everone is full of energy. The "on the fly" session scheduling has so far been working well, with people just writing down want they are planning to run on a big whiteboard, and then people signing up. In the morning I played Greg Stolze's new ORE game _Reign_, as run by Mr. Clinton Nixon, and had a blast. That game is worth it for the character generation system alone. Then I ran a whopping big game of Burning Wheel (using "The Gift" con scenario), and it was cool, and afterwards people were coming up to me saying "whatever you were playing at that table, you were having a blast!"<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to Sunday, if I can stay awake!<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>My second day at <a href="http://goplaynw.wetpaint.com/" rel="nofollow">Go Play NW</a> rocked my world.  It started out pleasently enough with a new installment of Ed's "Playful Watch" series of Zorcerer of Zo adventures.  I scored a new toy, Chuy from Hondurous, a toy blue tree frog who secretes poison, sticks to things, and desperately wants to be a real frog some day.  (Okay, he got his wish, the Zorcerer is kind).<br/><br/>Then the day took a turn for the seriously awesome, as I hooked up with Mr. Jake Richmond and his very amazing game of <a href="http://www.atarashigames.com/whatispantyexplosion.html" rel="nofollow">Panty Explosion</a>.  Yeah, I know what you are thinking, but it's a totally serious game that draws on the Japanese "psychic schoolgirl" genre, and we used it to create the most awesome and genuinely chilling J-Horror movie that you will never see, because it only exists in my, and two other guys heads!<br/><br/>Finally for a Con closer, I ran a rollicking game of Tunnels and Trolls.  When I wrote my game up on the scheduling board, there was total gang rush as people ran to sign up, and I wound up with six players.   Only two of them had played any T&amp;T before, but they took to it like ducks to water.  They pushed the saving roll system as hard as they could, with marvelous results.  One incident that stands out was the Dwarf Warrior (name of Pigface), whose talent was "Batterning Ram", lumbering through lines of goblins scattering them like ninepins, and then turning around and charging <i>back through</i> the lines, finally shoulder checking one on to the point of the Elf Warrior (Moonrazor)'s sword.<br/><br/>We also had an Elf wizard (Metro Natural), an Elf rogue (Legolamb), and a pair of brother &amp; sister Leprechauns (Rabbitpunk* and ??(shoot, I can't remember, somthing like "Glamsmack")) with a bad case of sibling rivalry, and a penchant for satyriasis.  (Safety tip... never leave an oversexed Leprechaun alone in a torture chamber for too long).<br/><br/>So <b>huge</b> thanks to the organizers for making this even happen, and at the moment they are definitely planning to make it happen again next year.  And to those following along at home, this was a triumph of quality over quantity (although the quantity was not bad either.  I estimate there were 30-35 events run over the course of two day).<br/><br/>Wooo!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77404/#Comment_77404" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T00:46:43+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 12:46AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Dudes.

The rest were new to TSOY, but had SG experience.<br/><br/>TSOY is great to teach to new people. I love the moment when you tell them about buying off keys and they start looking for the hook because they're SURE it can't be that good of a deal. TSOY is also a great game for the in-game "AHA!" moment. When you see people buying of keys relating to the current scene and buying keys that relate to what they want to do next, you know it's hitting. That happened both times I ran TSOY at Go Play.<br/><br/>I think we definitely opened some minds this weekend. I knew of two SG newbies at Go Play, and one of them played in Joe MacDonald's Perfect game on Sunday, which is getting pretty deep down the rabbit hole. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77446/#Comment_77446" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T08:46:06+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  8:46AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 8:57AM by ColinC.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, just wow.  Not sure where to start, but here's some highlights.<br/><br/>The pre-convention dinner gathering was an excellent idea.  It's nice to get to know people even the tiniest bit before you game with them, and I found myself a lot more at ease when I gamed the next day when someone I had met at the dinner was at the same table.<br/><br/>Got a great start to Saturday playing Beast Hunters with Christian, Joe McDonald, and a couple of other people whose names I've forgotten, but were no less awesome. I think I finally "get" the game now that I've played it with an experienced Challenger. Some awesome moments...\n<ul>\n<li>Our leader-type Hunter cutting her way through a bunch of male soldiers to get at the "real" enemy, their female leader.</li>\n<li>Our Spirit Warrior holding off the ninja-assassins who were trying to kill our ailing chief until her prayers to the spirits healed her.</li>\n<li>The small but fierce hunter wrestling with a war-dog and tearing out its freaking throat with his TEETH!</li>\n<li>All the fun I had playing the 7-foot tall skull-crushing maniac with the bones of his enemies woven into his beard.</li>\n<li>Christian for tying it all together.</li>\n</ul>\nNext was Inuma with Clinton, Jackson Tegu, and (again) some people who were equally awesome but whose names I've forgotten.  We had a kind of "Rock and Roll High School" vibe going, only with supercomputers and centaurs.  High points for me were: \n<ul>\n<li>Our Antagonist - The eerily calm and composed androgynous psychic, All-Is-Light.</li>\n<li>Clinton showing us how a real story gamer creates conflict...by having his deer-centaur storm into the Principals office and throw him out the freaking window!</li>\n<li>The unspoken love between my lovelorn vestal-virgin technician and the massive supercomputer ZEUS!</li>\n<li>The awkward Siren, Miss Evans, finally becoming comfortable with her siren powers and using them to lead a student revolt.<br/></li>\n</ul>\nLast game was Wilderness of Mirrors, the spy caper game by John Wick.  We had crazy scientists, a nuke hidden in a bank vault, and a beautiful Russian spy who was having affairs with not one but two of the PCs.  Special kudos go out to Anemone for seeing the game through after a rough spot in the middle.  I salute you!<br/><br/>I had hoped to play on Sunday as well, especially the Galactic Playtest where I would have been playing with Alan and JJSpackle who I had talked to so much at the Friday dinner. Sadly, logistics reared its ugly head and I had to head back to Portland first thing.  Next time I think I'll reserve a hotel for Sunday night as well and play through the whole day.<br/><br/>Thanks again to everyone who made this possible, and apologies to all the awesome people who I talked to or played with  but did not mention in this post.<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/>Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77451/#Comment_77451" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T09:18:27+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  9:18AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 9:21AM by blankshield.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GPNW was a total blast.  <br/><br/>Saturday afternoon, I ran Mountain Witch for a great bunch of folks - the ronin didn't even get halfway up the Mountain before they were sawing through ropes and dropping people off cliffs.  After this awesome was poured, they broke the mould.  <br/><br/>After supper on Saturday, I instigated a gorgeous round of 1001 Nights.  Serious props to Meg - we just started reading the book and flowed perfectly and naturally into play.  Our court turned out to be that of a generous Sultan who rarely angered, and allowed his courtiers much - the game ended with 3 out of 5 courtiers achieving their ambitions, and the other 2 almost doing it as well.   <br/><br/>Sunday morning I was in Paul Tevis' A Penny For My Thoughts psuedo-playtest.  I say "psuedo-" because the game we played (which I understand was a couple versions newer than the game on paper) was <i>done</i>.  I mean, yeah, tightening around the edges and a whole lot of writing, but the game was solid gold.  Top ---&gt; over.<br/><br/>I bookended the gaming with two rounds of Blood and Bronze, which John Harper will tell you is the second best Greek game.  He is, of course, wrong.  I hadn't really planned to get it out twice, but there were a bunch of folks who wanted in on the first round, and I kept getting asked if I was running it again... so I did.  Both of the sessions were awesome squared, but I'll let someone who isn't me talk about them.<br/><br/>I also proved once again that my purpose in Jungle Speed is to collect cards and sometimes look like I might win, to distract people from the real winner.<br/><br/>All of the gaming was awesome, but one of the things I really enjoyed was the meals.

Danger Patrol.  That was the A-list game of the weekend for me.  Awesome set-up, amazing characters, and balls-out action from the word "go."  Nothing like trying to save a grav-zeppelin packed with passengers that plummets to its doom in a kilometers-deep housing for Rocket City's power core, while terrorist commandoes storm the corridors, lightning bolts arc outside the zepp, and the team's Mystic Explorer and Robot Agent duel the Hounds of Tindalos for control of an immensely powerful alien artifact.  And Mssr. Harper ran it like a pro.  I told him I felt guilty tagging so many environmental aspects, but the game blew along at a brisk pace.  Character creation from the Style and Role cards was fun--and tough, because there are so many out-of-this-world choice combos.<br/><br/>The Burning Wheel game was a hoot as well.  Lots of cool maneuvering and posing as the Elves and Dwarves sought to outwit one another.  And it all came down to a blisteringly close ending with that Duel of Wits.<br/><br/>Ended my con in a TSOY game yesterday that clunked a bit out of the gate but accelerated to a rockin' climax by the end.  I started by playing an Ammeni Captain hunting pirates--figured I'd be the bad guy and push the envelope of ruthlessness with the idea I'd get beat down, but somehow, by the end of the game I'd transformed into one of the "good" guys.  At least not the villain I set out to be.<br/><br/>The Everway game was kinda disappointing.  Being in the same room as Sea Dracula did indeed save my sanity.  Nothing like watching guys body slam the wall next to your table, for instance.  Later, the noise drew our attention, and when we looked, we saw a guy on his side on the floor running around his shoulder while one of his co-players beat a loud rhythm on the table using an elbow while a second guy blew a hip-hop accompaniment into his hands and spiked it with shrill cries of "Auk!  Auk!"  I've never seen a group have so much exuberant fun.<br/><br/>Poom-chika-poom, poom-poom-pa-poom.  Poom-chika-poom--AUK! AUK!<br/><br/>Sea Dracula.  AUK!

Saturday started with <b>Blood and Bronze</b>, which has fantastic bits -- a hand-hammered bronze bowl and pennies (Canadian pennies!) painted crimson on one side.  I don't think I'm the right player for this game, it's too visual, requiring parsing and assembly of a compex visual situation before you can act.<br/><br/>After lunch, I played multi-player <b>Beast Hunters</b> with Ryan M. on my right and Matthew S-B on my left and Dan kinda across from me.  Ryan ran up a giant dude's arm and clobbered him from above.  Matt narrated a hill spirit into being and then stabbed it, causing an earthquake.  It was like 300 meets Conan, but less gentle, and will be a fabulous pick-up-and-play game for times when regular games fall through.<br/><br/>Session 3 was Kirk Mitchell's <b>Kin</b>.  I am in love with this game; it's the most natural issue-driven ensemble-cast story-game I've played, and it scaled tidily to our seven players.  Actual play is forthcoming, and I can't wait for the ashcan. We were Olympians living in the suburbs of 50's America.  Jake and Kingston rocked the house as our squabbling [m/p]atriarchs.  At the end, Kingston changed all Jake's lovers into animals, and the menagerie stamped the house, splitting it in two.<br/><br/>Sesson 4, early early Sunday, was <b>Dogs in the Boardroom.</b>  My victory conditions for the con were to play the classics of the genre with people I'd never played before.  This game totally fulfilled those conditions.  I've never played Dogs before, and my <b>non-gamer wife</b> has always been intrigued by it and came along to play.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if Dogs is the game for the complete beginner, though.  There are lots of moving pieces to it, and it took us most of the play session before we started rocking the traits / roll / raise / block / escalate / narrate / fallout cycle.   I think that a nice Dogs play mat, maybe sewn in the fashion of a Dog coat, with blackjack-like outlines for your raise dice, your pool, your unrolled dice, your blocking dice, and maybe some illustrative arrows between them, would be helpful for the noob.<br/><br/>We played the Boardroom scenario straight and seriously, and it kinda cut us too close to the bone.  In real life, V and I have worked with many of the dysfunctional morons who populated the boutique furniture factory we were fixing.  I do think I want to play Dogs again, but I want them to be in the Vineyard.  Thanks to Wilson Z., who was a good, patient teacher, and to Will H. whose hardheaded pinkslipper was a great counterpart to Victoria's sweetly manipulative earth mother.<br/><br/>Sesson 5 was another classic, <b>The Shadow of Yesterday</b>.  My victory token continued its inexorable march upwards, because this was the first time I'd ever gotten to play a game with my long-time writer bud Blake (Hexabolic here on S-G).  It was good he was along, too -- in the brutal final moments of the game, as we were exploring the cursed ruin of the Lich King, Ryan's veiled immortality cultista stabbed my witch doctor with a poisoned blade.  Blake's sea captain carried my guy's foaming, convulsing body away, ensuring that he did not die in the ruin and become a zombie himself.  Thanks, Blake!<br/><br/>Sesson 6 was Wilhelm's T&amp;T, and this is all I will say about that:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.cluas.com/images/music/opinion/heavy_metal.jpg"/><br/><br/>Many many thanks to the GPNW crew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77474/#Comment_77474" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T10:48:44+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 10:48AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ditto on the Danger Patrol playtest being awesome.

This game started with a bang, hit the targets, and rocked to a satisfying climax. The players riffed on each other like pros. Everyone was cheering on one player to transcend in the final scene. It was one of the most satisfying GM-ing experiences I've ever had.<br/><br/>Session 2 I facilitated Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries (Eric Boyd's game, to be released at Gen Con). The game has some fiddly bits, and it was a challenge to get it running for six people, so there was a bit of fumbling on my part. Once we got it going, it ran fine. Our expedition fought assassins at sea, mummies in Cairo, and dinosaurs in the Great Rift Valley. The highlight was when Paul Tevis' daring explorer leapt on the back of a pterodactyl and fought an aerial battle with the infamous Dr. Livingston.<br/><br/>Session 3 we played Jason Lutes board game in development, Thrilling Tales of Adventure, a globetrotting pulp adventure where each player takes the role of a pulp hero, but also drives the agenda of a nefarious villain. This game is an AWESOME big ticket board game in the tradition of War of the Ring or Twilight Imperium. It's not done yet, but I'd sit down and play it for four hours again in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>After sessions we had a John Harper Danger Patrol playtest where I got to be a great scientist entombed in the body of an atomic war machine, desperately seeking a cure for his situation. I had a great time riffing off the mystic character, as we each scoffed at the other's methods, while working together against the crimson commandoes.<br/><br/>Sunday I ran Principia (formerly Mathematic), my own game in development. We were really tired, and I had to jump around a bit with the TSOY mechanics before I got it right. We did, however, end with an epic evil werewolf vs. good werewolf battle framed by a steam pistol and saber fight against Count Zolvi's bizarre Circus of Death.<br/><br/>Edit: I am totally burned out, and I can't remember anyone's name correctly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB" title="Matthew_SB"><img alt="Matthew_SB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB">Matthew_SB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77482/#Comment_77482" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T11:06:24+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 11:06AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 2:48PM by Matthew_SB.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>I played multi-player<b>Beast Hunters</b>with Ryan M. on my right and Matthew S-B on my left.

Not just because they can help each other in-game, but because coming up with awesome things is just so much better with an audience that inspires one another. <br/><br/>The final assassin trying to slip away through the tunnels, Dan cutting her off, and then Matt and John in an aided action <i>busting through the wall</i> into the tunnel together from the adjacent foundation where John just drowned the assassin leader with his bare hands in the deep pool of rain conjured by Ryan's spirits? Perfect. <br/><br/>In the first game, Colin's character first retrieved Joe's sword that was lodged in stone (as Colin's character was the really powerful warrior) and tossed it to Joe to catch when he was facing off with the female leader, then Colin aided by grabbing two soldiers by the faces, lifting them up and keeping them from interfering with Joe's one-on-one fight (which ended when Joe pressed his enemy against a rock wall, swords crossed, and then killed her by <i>bashing her face in with his head</i>). <br/><br/>That's all the stuff of legends.

I missed the first and last sessions of that -- but it made for less burnout.  My games were: <br/><br/>Sat Afternoon: "Spirit of Serenity" (Spirit of the Century in the Firefly/Serenity background) that I game-mastered. <br/><br/>I was re-running the scenario that I ran for my home group.  It went very well, I think, though it was a bit of a tight fit to wrap up in 3 hours.  Still a little rough on the system.  <br/><br/>Sat Evening: Playtest of "Know Thyself", organized by author Ryan Macklin. <br/><br/>This was GMless amnesiac fun, where you decide what you do, but the players around you decide what you are like and where you are.  Joe McDonald played next to me, and particular kudos to him.  <br/><br/>Sat Night: Playtest  of "Cheap", game-mastered by author Joe McDonald.<br/><br/>This was pretty surreal scene-jumping stuff.  But in the end, we broke the game and took Joe's pants.  Sadly, however, the fairy wand was not invoked.  <br/><br/>Sun Morning: "Zorcerer of Zo", game-mastered by Edmund Metheny.<br/><br/>Zany fun in the wonderland of Zo, where we played misfit toys and character generation started by opening the wrapping of the toy present we selected.  I played Sir Sellsalot, a knight with aspirations to being a master salesman.  Extra kudos to Jackson Tegu, who managed to convincingly play a plastic <i>tea set</i> as his character.  <br/><br/>Sun Afternoon: "The Prince's Kingdom", game-mastered by author Clinton Nixon.<br/><br/>More kidsy fun as we went to a distant isle and dealt with problems there, using some pregenerated characters.  Clinton took on 7 players after many other sessions of gaming for a 3 hour slot, which was... ambitious.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77529/#Comment_77529" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T15:19:17+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  3:19PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Then the day took a turn for the seriously awesome, as I hooked up with Mr. Jake Richmond and his very amazing game of Panty Explosion.

Everything ran smoothly, the location was great, I thought the whole scheduling thing really worked out well with the meal breaks, etc. <br/><br/>Highlights for me, gamewise, were <i>The Mountain Witch</i> and the ever-in-development <i>Danger Patrol</i>. (I was the mystic explorer Cornelius Black, mentioned above, with the 'Let's see your science explain this, Professor!' aspect.) <i>Blood &amp; Bronze</i> was also great, though somewhat cut short by our total failure to grasp the game's strategic complexity -- poor Troy was eliminated almost instantaneously, crushed beneath the heel of Daedalus' flying machines.<br/><br/>Other games played included: <br/><br/>Reign: Hyenas with giant clitorises! Kill the tyrant! Kill the hyena cult! Kill the general! Random character generation is fun, but 3 hours was a little constrictive. Still, we did manage to fit it all in. The interaction between PC action and 'company rolls' was intriguing, and the presence of quaint things like 'armour' and 'hit location' was ambivalently oldschool.<br/>PTA: Everyday contemporary people begin to realise that they are in fact characters from popular fairy tale and myth. I feel bad about all the initial blocking I did in this game -- my energy level had plummeted due to delicious Italian food, and I was struggling to get my mind into the game. I think it came around eventually, though.<br/>Tunnels &amp; Trolls: Even though my character did almost nothing, this was a pretty fun game to watch. (And that's not some clever passive-aggressive snark in disguise.) Especially everyone's reactions to the delicious oldschool flavour (I think Joe had several laughing fits during character generation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77557/#Comment_77557" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T16:41:06+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  4:41PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So jealous.<br/><br/>Hey, organizers, how about a lessons learned and numbers run-down?

I can hardly believe it was only three days long.<br/><br/>The Friday gathering at the Elysian was a fantastic start. It set the tone for the whole event for me. Shouts out to Clinton, Wilhelm, Wilson Zorn and Chris Bennett for some excellent dinner conversation.<br/><br/>Friday night in the dorm lobby was dominated by <b>Jungle Speed</b>. Joe McDonald showed me that I am a mere mortal after all. Just snatching a few all-grabs (out of many many failures) felt like a small victory. Long will the song of Joe be sung in the halls of the tribe. Also props to Kirk for drawing first blood.<br/><br/>On Saturday I mainly helped the late-comers find a game, then sat with Blake and watched Clinton's session of <b>Reign</b>. It looked like a great game. I can't wait for my copy to show up. I also got to see Blake's incredible homemade character sheets and relationship maps for his Exalted/Wushu/Hack home game. Very cool stuff.<br/><br/>After the lunch break, I played in Wilhelm's <b>Burning Wheel</b> game, "The Gift." I had heard of Luke running this one at cons, and I was very excited to play. It did not disappoint. We had great elf vs. dwarf taunting and insults, secret whispered meetings, etiquette battles, and a huge fierce duel of wits to cap it all off. Extra special thanks to Sophie and Carla for playing the fearless leaders on each side.<br/><br/>For the session three slot, I ran a playtest of <b>Danger Patrol</b> with Clinton and Matt Gagan. This was my first time running the Fate/SotC-based version of the game, but it still went very well. I think all three of us were a little surprised by how much fun it was right out of the gate. Matt and Clinton created a mentalist villain (Enchantra!) that was the foil of Matt's character and the lost-love of Clinton's. The climax involved Clinton's Mutant Detective convincing Enchantra to give up her evil ways and help them stop the magna zeppelin from crashing into the Rocket City power core.<br/><br/>When that session wrapped, I was so jazzed from the playtest that I immediately ran it again for Tony Dowler, Blake Hutchins, Daniel Wood, Phil LaRose, and Doug Bartlett. This game had the same setup (crashing zeppelin) but the players created a very different set of bad guys through their initial scene framing. This time we had elite Crimson Republic commandos with walking spider bombs and an ancient mystical artifact that had attracted multidimensional monsters from beyond time and space. All the PCs were awesome, but the highlight had to be Blake's Mutant Flyboy: horns, hooves, and all. "Graaaahhhrr!"<br/><br/>Late-night Saturday I had a great talk with James, Carl, Paul, Jackson, and Brandon about running Dogs, Agon, functional ambiguity in game texts, and other stuff. It was one of those great bonding times where you just bask in the mutually shared interests of new friends.<br/><br/>On Sunday I played <b>Blood &amp; Bronze</b> with James, Alan, Brandon, and Daniel. Even though it is the <i>second</i> best competitive Greek game, it is still a pastime fit for kings. The rules are super simple but the strategy is deep, deep, deep. I think I may actually be able to win after I play it three more times. <br/><br/>The final session was Wilhelm's hardcore, turned-to-eleven <b>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</b> game. I got to play an Elf Warrior called Moonrazor who wielded a flaming vorpal Great Shamsheer and had the special talent, "Le Parkour." The first encounter of this game was more fun than every other dungeon adventure rpg I've ever played put together. Clinton's dwarven juggernaut "Pigface" (3'4", 540 pounds) and Joe's S/M Leprechaun Rogue were the icing on the cake of exploding awesome power.<br/><br/>I also felt like I made a dozen new friends. Chris Bennett, Blake Hutchins, James Brown, Carla, Jeremy -- I wish you guys were locals so we could hang out all the time. You guys are awesome.<br/><br/>The Vancouverites!! I love you guys. Joe, Daniel, Kirk -- not only are you great gamers but you're a ton of fun. You brought so much laughter and energy, you kept me going when my tank was almost empty. Also, Joe paid the proper fealty to me when we went out to dinner, so I will stay my doom hand of destruction for another year.<br/><br/>Super, crazy, mad props to Jackson Tegu, quite possibly the coolest guy in the world. I'm so glad you made the trek from the Middle of Nowhere to join our merry band.<br/><br/>Also big thanks to everyone who bought a t-shirt! We are a shoestring budget operation and every little bit helps a lot.<br/><br/>Now I must collapse. I feel as if I have just run ten marathons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Go Play NW]

It was wonderful meeting Kirk, Clinton, John Kim, and many many more who's names I have unforgivably forgotten. <br/><br/><b>Saturday<br/>Inuma</b> is a game in play test by Clinton Nixon. It is a game in two parts, the first part a collaborative world creation exercise with all the players at the table, the second a game master-less role playing game using the characters you create in part one. This is one of the most accessible games I have ever played, both mechanically and socially. Since the infamous five threads of the forge, story gamers have been talking about a game that is accessible to non gamers: spouses, parents, co-workers, ect. Inuma is the first game I have seen that approaches that goal. <br/><br/>Another awesome thing about this game is the way it drives to to play characters you would never create on your own. I would never have created a character who's main issue was "will my beauty be a tool of my oppression or liberation?" but  playing her was a blast. <br/><br/><b>kin</b> is another game master-less game in play test by Kirk Mitchell. It's been discussed in an other threads, so let me just say it's the most fun I had at the con, and that I eagerly await it's publication.  <br/><br/><b>Sunday</b><br/><b>Galactic</b> is another game in play test. It is a science fiction game with each player playing the captain of a starship. When the spotlight is on you, you play the captain, and when it is not, you play the crew.   It was a lot of fun to play, with a lot of player collaboration built into creating setting and situation. I was a little distracted at the table, I must admit, preparing for my next game.<br/><br/><b>The Shadow Of Yesterday</b> was a game I game mastered. This is the first time I have ever designed or GMed a con game, and I am afraid it showed. I was less prepared than I ought to have been, and the situation did not force character interaction the way a con game should. Nevertheless, the players showed awesome initiative, the litch king and his Stockholm syndrome afflicted wife were appropriately creepy, and it all rose to an awesome climax.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the whole thing was awesome, and I eagerly await next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bolthy" title="bolthy"><img alt="bolthy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bolthy">bolthy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78852/#Comment_78852" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T19:26:06+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  7:26PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2007 7:30PM by bolthy.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>hah! plugged the cord back in!<br/>Ed's moderation was the grande, and playing alongside jon, sophie, wilhelm, laura and ....
