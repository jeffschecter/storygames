                    In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1838" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a>, Jesse tells us about something he witnessed when observing a game of SotC:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Hello Everyone,<br/><br/>So, I went to GenCon SoCal briefly on Friday night and all day Saturday.  While I was there I got to observe part of a Spirit of the Century game; character creation on Friday night and then part of actual play on Saturday.  Now what I'm about to say is going to come off as very harsh cricticsm of Spirit of the Century so I have to be clear up front.  I have not read Spirit of the Century and I have not actually played it myself.  My comments are strictly based on what I saw happening at that table and even then I was doing one or two other things (like reading Wilderness of Mirrors).<br/><br/>Here's what I think I saw.  I saw a character generation system/session that rapidly generated a lot of pulp flavored color and got everyone grooving on each other's character's look and feel.  This is not a bad thing.  This is, in fact, the best thing I saw and after watching this I had high hopes that Spirit of the Century might actually be a game that interests me.<br/><br/>Then I saw the actual play.  And it seemed to me that the game kind of walked out the door.  What I saw was a bunch of great personalities creatively riffing of each other's color that was generated during the character generation process.  I saw a lot of creative use of key catch phrases.  I saw laughing and smiling.  I'm not denying anyone's fun here.  But what I didn't see was a game.  I saw a bunch of people talking and then (without much structure at all) sort of employing an overly complex version of a coin flip to occassionaly decide whether something should go left or go right.  Not once did I see any tension, decision making or cross-table player engagement happen over the deployment of the resolution mechanic.  All the fun here was because people were doing something I call Engaging The Players Around The Game. <br/><br/>[snip: he wants something he calls I call this Engaging The Player Through The Game, like the raise/see mechanic in Dogs.]<br/><br/>Now I would like to say, I saw a potential mechanic in Spirit of the Century that MIGHT be used to the ends I'm talking about.  It's the rule that I think is called Compelling An Aspect.  (Again I haven't read the game so this is coming from observing the game).  So my understanding is that the GM can offer up a resource called a Fate Chip to get your character to do something specific.  If you want to refuse you have to pay a Fate Chip.  This is how I WANT this mechanic to be used:<br/><br/>Let's say I'm playing a detective (Jack Bloodthorn) with the Aspect "There's always a Dame..."  Bloodthorn is walking up to the house of a key witness when he hears gunshots inside.  Then there's a scream and he sees a woman (not the witness) being driven off in the back of a car speeding out of the front drive.  The GM offers up a Fate Chip and says he wants Bloodthorn to chase after the woman 'cause, "There's always a Dame!"<br/><br/>See what I'm facing now?  Part of this is the get a chip/pay a chip decision but I'm also being asked what the safety of the witness is worth vs the safety of the unknown woman.  The offering of the Chip is an underscore or exclamation mark around the decision.  It signals to everyone at the table, "Hey this is important!"  The Aspect demonstrates WHY it's important.  And my decision to take a chip or spend a chip demonstrates just HOW important it is.  Engagement THROUGH the system.<br/><br/>My problem was that I didn't really see this potential use of that system deployed and I didn't see much of the rest of the system organized around its use in the manner i describe.  Note: For all know this was never the intended use of the mechanic anyway so criticising it for failing to be central is not really the point.<br/>Jesse</blockquote>
To which a lot of knowledgeable people replied in all matters of ways, but we all probably don't have enough experience with Fate 3.0 under our belt to really know if Jesse is right. Eventually, I replied:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: oliof</cite>I have a suspicion regarding Fate 3.0 and the tendency to forget about the fate point issue:<br/><br/>There are three different flavors of resolution: Simple rolls against fixed numbers (checks), complex rolls on both sides (contests), and chained complex rolls (conflicts). It's easy to only use the first two kinds of flavors and gloss over the third. For example, I had all the players roll once  to determine if they fall under the roaches' influence. This should have been a conflict where a number of wins in a row are very important because of the roll-up feature on the damage track. You really want to hit high marks repeatedly to force your opponent to concede, which you'll probably achieve by using your own or tagging your opposition's aspects.<br/></blockquote>
To put this another way: SotC does not <b>force</b> you to do all the conflict back-and-forth thingie, but it shines if you do, bringing the full impact of compelling/assessing/declaring/tagging aspects.<br/><br/>This is something I see as a <b>boon</b> over Dogs, where everything is a conflict when I don't want to say yes outright. I have like four options in Spirit of the Century - saying yes, make it an action, make it a contest, or make it a conflict. <br/><br/>Given my limited knowledge of indie games, in the regard of aspect use and conflicts, SotC is more along the lines of TSoY than along the lines of Dogs in the Vineyard. It's up to the players to hit their aspects (like keys in TSoY), and conflicts only come into play "when two or more characters are in opposition in a fashion that cannot be quickly and cleanly resolved." That, of course is quite ambiguous, which can be seen as a design flaw or feature. It's also possible that for a demo game at a convention, the GM is more inclined to go for quick-and-easy than for long-and-possibly-drawn-out.<br/><br/>Again: I try to be succinct: SotC supports different rules depths according to the needs of a given group. If you think the aspect mechanics should rule the game, play for conflicts where possible. If you want to play it nice and loose, use conflicts for fighty stuff and key scenes only.<br/><br/>I'd love some input by players of the game in question (especially the GM) and, of course, the terrific trio that authored my current favorite pulp game. I should probably ask a question so you know what I aim at. Everybody else too, of course!<br/><br/>In <b>Spirit of the Century</b>, how does the GM cleanly decide when a conflict is in order? How does he create opposition that clearly has conflict potential? (OK, these are two questions, bear with me).                </div>

                            You are basically right, and we don't have a lot of guidance on what level of granularity things shoudl resolve at because we hoped it would be one of those things that could evolve very organically from a playgroup's interest, rather than explicit declaration like bringing down the pain.<br/><br/>To my mind, a conflict is anything I -can't- reasonably resolve in one roll, but that is partly because I like resolution ot be fast, light and out of the way whenever possible.  However, I probably represent one extreme of the spectrum in that regard, and the point of transition could be moved towards the middle.  That said, hmm, that may be somethign we could provide more guidance for in our next game.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            For me, conflicts are all a matter of pacing.  Early fights against insignificant foes, information-seeking that gets from point A to point B, those are all candidates for single-roll resolution.  When things start getting tenser, when the plot moves into the second act or whatever -- conflict time.  So for me, I do it all based on a "feel" for what's "interesting".  I think the fact that this is very much an <i>instinctual</i> (rather than conscious) process for me is why I, at least, didn't push for when-to-do-this guidelines in SOTC.                        </div>
