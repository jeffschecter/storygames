Upon arriving she notices that there are a lot of customers tonight, both mundanes and changelings (about ten of the Lost, highly unsual). [...] at around 7 pm, a burly Ogre proudly displaying [...] a symbol of the Court of Summer, enters the cafe. He asks Bella what\u2019s going on tonight, what with so many changelings there? Bella merely shrugs him off, telling him the truth, that she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. [Later, when the owner of the cafe arrives, she] asks Bella about the abnormal number of Lost at the cafe tonight, and after Bella says she doesn\u2019t know, Amara makes a few calls and finds out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><u>Behind the Scenes</u></b><br/>\nLastly, the whole thing with the Spring Court party was a pulled-out-of-my-butt thing because for some reason I said that there were a lot of changelings in the cafe and that was odd. Then I had the Ogre ask Bella about it, making it even more of an issue. Now, here is a perfect example of where my roleplaying mind has been in the last six months or so: Story Games and Story Now. It was unintentional, because I knew my wife was not going to pick up on the handoff (she just doesn\u2019t know about the hippie style of gaming I have been exposed of late, and though she is all about telling a story at the game, I would have to introduce these techniques slowly so she can add them to her gaming repertoire without calling them Rules or anything like that), but I threw it nevertheless: tell me why there are so many Lost here; tell me what is going on. To be fair, it was also very late and we were both already on the downward spiral to sleep, so I had to figure out a reason why this was happening (which is why Amara arrives and makes a couple of calls, above).</div>\n</blockquote>\nNow, my wife is not a gamer and could care less about story gaming and all that I spend my day learning about. She just likes to play, but she is all about the story, so I think she would take well to story gaming techniques. I just have to find ways of introducing them without her noticing they are "mechanics," but rather new ways of playing the game. Basically, I'd like to break her out of the GM/Player divide, and start getting her more into a Shared Authorship model. This was one attempt, though it failed. I would love ideas on how to accomplish my ultimate goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119691/#Comment_119691" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T11:41:04+00:00" title="January 15, 2008 11:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems interesting, Daniel...I'm going to a Lost demo this weekend, so I hope I can get a better grasp of things there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119783/#Comment_119783" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T20:35:12+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  8:35PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
