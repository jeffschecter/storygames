The regular game is very similar to Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh, you play a hero, with cards placed into play representing your forces (allies in an adventuring party in WoW, rather than summoned critters), your buffs and power-ups, etc.  The players get cards into play and battle it out until someone wins.  <br/><br/>The raid decks have a few special rules custom to that raid, and Big Frickin' Monsters with well-tuned combos that only the cooperative force of three to five allied player-parties can overcome.  So, yeah, in a way it's like an old-fashioned dungeon crawl.  But...<br/><br/>It lacks any sense of travel, though.  In a dungeon crawl, you go from room to room, place to place, <i>exploring</i>.  The raid decks don't seem to provide that feeling, at least from a first read-through.  One, <b>Magtheridon's Lair</b>, has two phases; the big bad, Magtheridon, starts 'chained' and becomes 'unchained' when the Raid player collects enough Blood cards.  The 'unchained' version is even more frightfully overpowering than the 'chained' version, of course. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  But that still doesn't equate (to me) to a sense of travel, movement, or exploration.  <br/><br/>I don't think that the WoW TCG is quite the game that the Penny Arcade author wants it to be.  But you're right, there's an uncomfortably intriguing idea in there.  Could a TCG be designed that would work as a 'party vs GM' game?  We've got various Story Games that have a GM budget (<i>Agon</i>, <i>Beast Hunters</i>, <i>Burning Empires</i>, the new <i>Magical Land of Yeld</i>, and possibly more I don't know about).  Can that be married to a card-based mechanic?  Actually, <i>Sons of Liberty</i> is close to that mechanically...<br/><br/><b>Insane sleep-deprived visions follow:</b><br/><br/>A GM's Quest Deck customized for a particular Quest Site, built to a certain point value of cards.  The point value of it's badassery is decreased by the value of the goodies in the GM's Treasure Deck.  The more loot the GM is willing to hand out, the nastier his Quest Deck can be.<br/>A Map-grid, mostly blank, with cells that can contain cards.  Maybe most of the Map-cards are generic, and come out of a separate deck.  Only 'special' rooms/locations are in the GM-deck.  Or maybe not...<br/>Several players, each with a customized Character Deck deck that represents their character -- his or her feats, skills, items, pets, retainers, etc.  Lots of flavor here.  <br/>The players know in advance the point value of the Quest Site, and have brought characters of appropriate strength/level/whatever.  <br/>The game progresses with the players moving around the Map-grid, and rooms/locations being played onto it.  Traps are discovered and evaded (or not), monsters and enemies are encountered and fought.  Loot is acquired, and the characters get tougher...<br/><br/>Problems with this:  Either you are limited to the printed cards, which limits everybody's creative input, or you have to make up a bunch of blank cards that people can write on when they make up new stuff.  If as GM I want to create 'Letitia the Bloodthirsty Vampire' armed with a magical 'Thorn Whip' as an encounter, what do I do -- there aren't any cards for that.  If as a player I want my character to have a customized skill or piece of gear, what do I do -- there's no card for it, I just made it up.  Hmmm.  Also, it's all very high-trust.  It's Gamist as all Hell, but there's no built-in controls.  Hmmm.<br/><br/>Gonna have to sleep on this.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139374/#Comment_139374" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T01:04:56+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  1:04AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know how monopoly or hungry hungry hippos would have gone through a design process at some point?<br/><br/>Dain, your seeing there's no built in controls because it's not actually playing. It's reverting from play back into a design process. But it's pretending it's playing the game as intended.<br/><br/>It's not gamist, it's simulationist. Because the play comes from pretending that design process is actually play and everything being done is part of normal, standard, everyday play. Maintaining that bubble of belief is paramount - more important than any step on up. If step on up gets in the way of that bubble, step on up has to go. That creative denial priority makes it simulationist.<br/><br/>That's my technical estimate of the goals here and in the penny arcade post. I'm writing it in short here just in case it's useful - short enough that the thread can roll onto other stuff if no one percieves a use.<br/><br/>I will say though, if it doesn't make sense, have you considered where the line is between playing and designing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139407/#Comment_139407" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T12:31:08+00:00" title="April 12, 2008 12:31PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thomas Denmark has been working on a set of rules for playing Dungeoneer (the card game) as an RPG much in the manner you describe.

The dungeons in WoW are NOT for exploring, with a few very rare exceptions. Most of them are entirely about, and only about, sequencing an order of encounters that must be overcome. Oh, in some few cases, you actually have a choice in the sequence (do we take out the group on the left, or the group on the right?) But in most cases, the encounters are so close together, that they actually pose a problem that you might set them off accidentally - avoiding doing so is one of the first lessons you get in an "instance" of a dungeon. <br>\n<br>\nThe other case is where things are a bit more open, and the order of things is largely up to you... but in these cases it's usually tactically sound to only do things in one order, and part of the challenge is determining the order (and since somebody has written about it somewhere, the challenge is to be sure you've done your reading before hand, and do it the right way). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, nowhere in any of this is any exploration of anything except the details of the challenges, in WoW play. Going in you even know that the piece of gear that you're going in to get has a 37.5% chance to drop off the second boss when he's killed. Nothing to discover, only challenge to overcome. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said... I'm overstating the case in a way... that is, everybody does this thing where you wander into an instance of a dungeon or raid area, and look around a bit. But the fact is that this is less about exploring the place at all, or anything about it or the creatures, and more about testing whether or not it's a place you want to come back to later, when you're prepared. Because you don't ever expect to get through a WoW instance, unless you have just the right mix of resources with you, or you're massively over-leveled (at which point it just becomes a question of how fast you can sweep up the treasure - my Lvl 70 gnome ran through the entire Stockades instance in fifeen minutes last night... twice). Random exploration quickly means "Wipe" (or Total Party Kill for the TTRPG crowd). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game actually actively discourages exploring around. No, you "Level Around" if you will. There's nothing for you in a zone that is too high level for you. I mean even if you have enough money accumulated from grinding, and you purchase a wonderful item from the new zone, a hard level limit will prevent you from using it until you level up. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to maintain gamism balance, WoW decisively does all it can to kill any sort of exploration other than tactics. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... for what it's worth, the card game is quite accurate sounding from your description. Now... is that fun? I dunno. It's "just a game" right? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
