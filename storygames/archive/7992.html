I was in the shower and I had an idea that I thought I would share. Basically, my idea is this:<br/><br/>If you're writing an indie RPG, you might put up content "for your consideration", run demos, etc, to try and get feedback to make your game ready. However, sometimes it is tricky to get feedback (maybe, I don't know, I have no actual experience).<br/><br/>If you entered into a pact with other people, kind of like Game Chef works, to write and get feedback from other people -- that's well and good but nobody really has any skin in the game besides their reputation (and the desire to win!).<br/><br/>What if you entered into a pact with people and paid money into a "fund" for your game, every time you submitted content to them for feedback. Then, when your game was ready to be published, the money would be released to you to pay production costs (essentially, the money is held in escrow for you). If you never finished your game, it would be donated to charity.<br/><br/>My logic is this -- its actually kind of easy to write content, throw it on the wall, and see what sticks. But then there's not necessarily an incentive for you to continue making that content more mature and eventually publishing it for the world to consume. This is unfortunate when you take people's time and energy to gather feedback and then never actually produce anything, and creates friction for these people to provide feedback in the future (potentially to others who might even make good use of it). If you were forced to invest ($$$) in the eventual publication of your game, it would produce that incentive and also it would ensure that people bake their ideas pretty well before they put them out for other people to review.<br/><br/>That is my idea, it has some flaws, but I thought I would share it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176705/#Comment_176705" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T11:21:40+00:00" title="October 29, 2008 11:21AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Self-Funded Ransom, with penalty for defaulting?

So what's the Self-Ransom, then? Specifically (a) how much do I put in, (b) how often (each draft, one-time), and (c) can I just get it back when I put a PDF on Lulu?

Something like that would certainly formalize the relationship between the designer and his lil' helpers a bit. If nothing else, it would motivate a person when he's otherwise unmotivated.<br/><br/>As a guy who gives feedback now and then, I'd like to say that I'm mostly not very concerned about this time-wastage factor in practice. Mostly it comes up when I see that the guy obviously needs help, but am also uncertain whether he's just messing around or being serious. If a guy is both proficient and messing around, I'm fine with messing around with him for the fun of it. If he's clueless but serious, I'm fine with helping him get somewhere. If he's proficient and serious, all the better. <b>But</b> if he's both clueless and non-serious, that's where I'm frustrated: I just spent several hours laying out the basics for some guy who was just shooting a random idea up in the air.<br/><br/>However, another bit that's important in this relationship is that neither the designer nor the studio critic can promise absolute fidelity to each other. It's happened to me more times than I can count that a project simply deviates from my domain of understanding when the designer finds some new direction for it and starts running there - and I as the lil' helper <i>have to let him go</i>. Some of the more prominent projects I've been involved with have been just like this... <i>Polaris</i> comes to mind, Ben lost me for a long time in between abandoning his TSoY-like aspect architecture and picking up the key phrases. And, similarly, the designer can't and shouldn't promise fidelity: he needs to be able to discount the feedback and openly confess that another's vision is not matching up with his and there is no reason to try so hard.<br/><br/>So really, in a way I look at these relationships as ships passing in the night more than marriages. It is to be cherished when somebody is inspired and capable of supporting your work on some leg of the journey, but it's not something that can be meaningfully forced against a certain degree of incompatibility without essentially making the project a collaboration - either you follow your own vision, or what the others are telling you to do. I'm not saying that you can't be there for another designer until his project is finished, mind - even if I'm forced to confess that I don't understand the designer's current thinking process (like, say, what Paul Czege is currently doing with Acts of Evil), I can still be available to do playtesting and stuff... and sometimes you can even jump back into a project when some communication or other jogs something for you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176734/#Comment_176734" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T15:47:23+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  3:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>As a guy who gives feedback now and then, I'd like to say that I'm mostly not very concerned about this time-wastage factor in practice.

So sure, helping someone out might be good for everyone, but now we're talking degrees -- would you rather help someone and everyone (you+them) is happy, or help someone realize a finished product and everyone (you+them+potential audience) is happy? That's what I'm trying to design an incentive for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

Unfortunately, I don't find the question to be that Zen.<br/><br/>But it may be more productive to answer your question with another one -- do people enjoy going to the DMV as much as they enjoy driving? Both are technically non-compulsory, but most people I know will do one to get to do the other. <br/><br/>In more general terms, while an overall project may seem like a good use of time, a particular (but <i>completely necessary</i>) element may be onerous or unpalatable. I'm trying to reduce the friction in completing these time-consuming, annoying, or difficult constituent tasks (playtesting, editing, whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176802/#Comment_176802" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T11:15:47+00:00" title="October 30, 2008 11:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there not a chance that a scheme like this might well result in bad product coming to market?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, you start your game and all seems fine, you slip cash into the aether ready to get it back when you publish. You are happily approaching the deadline date and BAM! You realise that there are fundamental problems with your game. You literally have days to decide. What do you do?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Work all the hours of the day and night desperately trying to fix and test it<br/>\n2. Beg an extension from your testers, thus making the entire point of the exercise invalid.<br/>\n3. Publish anyway because it would be better to publish a flawed system and get some return on your investment than lose the money altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think we have a system like this in place already but it involves credibility. If you are someone who always has a hot new project that desperately needs testing and comment, but it never gets passed alpha notes before the next hot new project comes along, people will realise what their help will achieve in the long run and some people will self-select out of helping.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.
