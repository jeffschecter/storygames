We meet (almost every) Monday from 7PM to 10:30.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past few months our numbers have declined due to work and moves, and we're looking for interested players and GMs to join our merry band. We're currently spending a few sessions playing a number of games, looking for something that really sticks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are currently playing:<br/>\nDungeon World<br/>\nDogs in the Vineyard<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have recently played:<br/>\nApocalypse World<br/>\nMouse Guard RPG.<br/>\nLeverage<br/>\nPoison'd<br/>\nFiasco<br/>\n<br/>\nJust let me know if you're interested. We're very easy to get to for Essex/Passaic gamers, and reasonably easy for Bergen/Morris.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
