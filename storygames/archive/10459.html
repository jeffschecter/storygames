I posted the rest <a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/everway_karmatic.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> but I wrote it all for this post.\n<p>Now, Karma is just comparing numbers. To see if you can defeat someone<br/>in combat, compare your \u201cFire\u201d score with the antagonist\u2019s \u201cEarth\u201d score. Alternatively, just compare \u201cFire\u201d to \u201cFire\u201d to see which one is the better fighter, using \u201cEarth\u201d to break ties. (I like comparing one\u2019s \u201cFire\u201d to the other\u2019s \u201cEarth\u201d and vice versa. Maybe both will end up defeated. Maybe none.)</p><p>The higher number wins. Use Drama or Fortune whenever Karma gives a tie.</p><h3>Multiple participants</h3><p>In some contests, like running, people partake individually and the highest score wins.</p><p>In others, like fighting, you can \u201cgang up\u201d and co\xf6perate, for example, a gang of humans fighting against one dragon.</p><p>Now, here\u2019s the twist. In Everway, a score of \u201c3\u201d is twice as good as a score of \u201c2\u201d, a score of \u201c7\u201d is twice as good as \u201c6\u201d and so on. So, two fighters with \u201c6\u201d each will tie against one fighter with \u201c7\u201d. Two fighers with \u201c5\u201d each (which is equivalent to one \u201c6\u201d) will lose against one fighter with \u201c7\u201d.</p><p>This is cool for two reasons. First, it makes it easy to get crazy numbers. For example, someone with \u201c7\u201d is equivalent to sixteen regular humans (\u201c3\u201d is the regular non-hero average). Great since this is a \u201cpowers\u201d game. Hulk smash! Second, these crazy numbers make Karma more solid. The gamemaster can think \u201cShould I really bring in Drama or Fortune? After all, she is twice as good as climbing as that thief, of course she can catch up with him in the trees!\u201d</p><p>So if two sixes tie a seven, what\u2019s the deal with a more heterogenous mix of scores? Glad you asked, because that\u2019s the reason why I wrote this article!</p><p>Can, for example, a motley crew of one \u201c3\u201d, two \u201c4\u201ds and one \u201c6\u201d humans gang up to defeat or tie one \u201c7\u201d dragon?</p><p>Get ten little \u201cplaces\u201d; mancala bowls or rubber bands or post-its on the table. Assign a number of one to ten, one to each \u201cplace\u201d. Get beads (or paper clips or beans or something). Assign one color to each side. For example, the motley crew might have black beads and the dragon might have a white bead.</p><p>For every participant in the contest, place one bead on the \u201cplace\u201d for that participant\u2019s relevant score. In the example, place the dragon\u2019s white bead in the \u201c7\u201d place, place one of the motley crew\u2019s black beads in the \u201c6\u201d place, two in the \u201c4\u201d place and one in the \u201c3\u201d place.</p><p>Now, look for pairs of beads in a single color. For every pair, remove one bead and put the other in the next highest place. In the example, there is a pair of white beads in the \u201c4\u201d place. Remove one of them and put the other in the \u201c5\u201d place.</p><p>Repeat the last step until there are no same-colored pairs anywhere.</p><p>Now, look in the highest place that has beads. If only one side has beads there, that side won. If both sides have beads there, move on down until you see a place where only one side has a bead. As soon as you do, that side won. If you reach the bottom, it\u2019s a tie, use Drama and/or Fortune. In the example, the highest place that has beads, the \u201c7\u201d place, still only has a white bead. The dragon won.</p><p>Let\u2019s try some more examples. The idea is to practice this so you can do it in your head, on paper or with your fingers. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s easy once you get used to it. (If it seems difficult or nerdy, it\u2019s because you\u2019re reading this without the props. Go ahead, at least go get some scrap paper and a pencil!)</p><p>Three \u201c5\u201ds and a \u201c6\u201d versus one \u201c7\u201d.</p><p>Look for duplicates: two of the \u201c5\u201ds can become one \u201c6\u201d. After that, we\u2019ll have two \u201c6\u201d which becomes one \u201c7\u201d. That leaves one of the \u201c5\u201ds and one \u201c7\u201d, vs the other side\u2019s \u201c7\u201d (which didn\u2019t change) once the \u201cduplication moving\u201d step is done. Now comparison. The highest place with beads is the \u201c7\u201d place. It has beads of both colors. Move on down. The next highest is the \u201c5\u201d place. It has only one color. That side won! Congratulations!</p><p>I\u2019ve kept a single participant on one side because that\u2019s how skirmishes often work, \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d. A band of adventurers fighting two bears might concentrate on them one at a time, especially if the room allows.</p><p>However, sometimes it\u2019s more straight forward to have multiple participants on both sides. Imagine a contest between teams to build the cleverest contraption. Then you\u2019d use \u201cAir\u201d scores (thought, spoken wisdom and focused energy) and every one on every team would pitch in.</p><p>Let\u2019s run through an example of that, as well. Two \u201c3\u201ds, a \u201c4\u201d and four \u201c6\u201d vs a \u201c7\u201d and an \u201c8\u201d.</p><p>The two \u201c3\u201ds become one \u201c4\u201d, which makes a total of two \u201c4\u201ds, which becomes one \u201c5\u201d instead. The four \u201c6\u201d become (via two \u201c7\u201d) one \u201c8\u201d. Comparison time: The highest place with beads is the \u201c8\u201d place. It has beads of both colors. Move on down. The next highest is the \u201c7\u201d from the smaller team, which means that that team is the winner!</p><p>This \u201cmultiple participants on both sides\u201d can be used for larger battles that you don\u2019t want to break down into skirmishes.</p><p>Make up some other numbers and try practicing doing the comparison in your head, with scrap paper or on your fingers.</p><p>Try to see it as a \u201ccomparison\u201d of numbers with the highest score being the most significant, and duplicates \u201ccarrying\u201d over towards becoming more significant.</p><p>Now, the way I\u2019ve presented the system says nothing about other things, like which weapons the participants are using or whether or not the contraption-inventing thinkers come from a background of inventing contraptions or if they\u2019re from a rock-bashing hunter-gatherer society. The Everway game books goes to the other extreme, emphasing circumstance and background over ability score.</p><p>It\u2019s up to the individual gamemaster.</p><p>One idea is that if one side has a strong horse, a good book of magic or a sharp sword, it could count as a \u201ccontest participant\u201d with a particular score. For example, instead of a sword being a \u201c+2 magic sword\u201d, which would mean that who ever wielded it would be four times as good, it could bring a \u201c2 score advantage participant\u201d to the contest, meaning it would break ties between two \u201c6\u201d:es and it would allow a \u201c2\u201d-score to tie with a \u201c3\u201d-score combatant. This idea is pretty flawed (since if your hero can\u2019t read in the fiction, it doesn\u2019t matter how many magic books you schlep along) so use it with care.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232451/#Comment_232451" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T09:43:41+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  9:43AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Solid thinking--will steal.
