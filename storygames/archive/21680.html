I refer to it as the difference between first-order and second-order mysteries: known unknowns versus unknown unknowns. "Who killed the King?" is fine, as long as there's either a pre-set answer or a pre-set procedure for collaboratively authoring who the murderer is. "There was a mystic super god manipulating things behind the scenes the whole tiem!`11!~!!!" is an example of the bad thing.<br/><br/>I just finished playing 5E's Tomb of Annihilation, and man... there is some serious second-order wonkiness in that dungeon. It's not quite on the level described above, but it's... pretty serious. In particular there's just no way to know whether you need to complete all of, or just some of, certain mysteries / quests in the dungeon, in order to complete the dungeon as a whole. Led to a lot of unfun bickering.<br/><br/>I'm fine with "the information is incomplete, but you still have to make a decision," but TELL US the information is incomplete. Otherwise we'll just look for clues to try to get complete information to make the decision.\n<blockquote>I'm also less than thrilled when players keep reasoning or ideas to themselves; I want to be able to knowingly play off of other people's ideas, not have to guess at what they are.</blockquote>\nYeah, this too, but this is obviously more of a player problem... though a good GM will hopefully keep the group on the same page about communications!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474372/#Comment_474372" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-01T03:28:46+00:00" title="June  1, 2018  3:28AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried to learn to ask "why?" as a GM so I don't accidentally cut off options. Like, if you're asking "what floor is [X] on?" and I don't have a floor picked out and have no clue why you're asking and don't bother to ask why, I'll likely roll a die to get the answer.<br/><br/>This is often the wrong move because the player is usually wondering something like "Can I jump out the window / climb up to the balcony / do some other cool thing?" and I don't want to nerf that by accident. Whether I should nerf it deliberately for Some Reason or Other is a fraught question, but whatever answer I have for that, I'm quite sure I should NOT nerf it by accident.<br/><br/>I'm also trying to learn to do things like<br/><br/>* saying "Okay, you've got all the information here. If at any point I realize I forgot something, we'll rewind, flashback, or otherwise do what we need to, as you would totally have gotten that information."<br/><br/>* saying outright "This would make things unfun for [X reason] at this point, but you've started doing what you need to for it, and it WILL bear fruit once that is no longer a factor." Best if I look at the situation and realize X reason never applied to begin with, but at the very least, don't keep the player in the dark about the meta.<br/><br/>One way or another, I tend to be running mysteries. I've learned one useful division of type:<br/><br/>* Mysteries players solve. I have very smart players and they outnumber me, so this often happens.<br/><br/>* Mysteries that unfold around the players. I have players who want their PCs to act and who do not want to try to outthink me or whatever scenario author I'm borrowing from this week. They're generally fine with "unfold around" meaning "we'll hit certain dramatic tropes that have your PC at a disadvantage" so long as they get to act.<br/><br/>* Mysteries that... aren't. Basically, the Columbo or Dogs in the Vineyard set up. Columbo quickly figures out who did the deed; it's a matter of proof. The entire town will tell the Dogs exactly what is going on. The Dogs then have to decide what to do about it.<br/><br/>I've played and enjoyed mysteries where the solution was created in play. I've done that sort of thing with a particular Gumshoe scenario, sort of. The scenario left bad guy choice up to GM, allowing for modifying it based on how the PCs investigated. I decided write each possible NPC on an index card, shuffle the cards, roll an appropriately-sided die, and count that many cards, and stick to that as my big bad's identity.<br/><br/>This worked. I made a few false steps in the scenario, but that was not one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474380/#Comment_474380" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-01T09:06:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2018  9:06AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            tbh with mysteries, I just want to decide the answer playerside before the mystery starts, because I'm not at all interested in the "figuring it out"; I'm just interested in how the characters are affected by investigating and figuring out the mystery, and the interesting roleplay that comes of that investigation, how it affects the relationships between the characters.

Now I enjoy that feeling of discovery as much as any player and I don't have to wait anymore for a critical roll in the precise dramatical moment to see a great twist, nor suffer watching the plot or world I built being torn apart by the PC actions. Now that has become a goal of my GMing style.<br/><br/>But first I had to learn how to embrace that, how to watch my own creations through crosshairs. I had to learn to take player's guesses and quickly turn them into fiction facts, faster than they would expect or just wait until they least expected them.<br/><br/>The results made the learning curve worthy and put my illusionism skills to good work. I still make a few decissions before the game and try to stick to them for the sake of coherence. If I change my mind in the middle of the session is usually because whatever they come up with is way better than my prep. <br/><br/>The players still solve mysteries in our games, especially now that I don't solve those for them nor leave breadcrumbs to the next clue. I merely act as their Watson, I confirm the guesses that coincide with my prep, interpretate sucessful dice rolls as the info they predicted coming up as they told, or as hypothesis proved wrong when they roll a miss. As a GM I just have to keep coherence and the case shapes itself, players become sherlock by their own merit and still do all the thinking.<br/><br/>I'm totally open from the start to the players about prepping some stuff and coming up with some other in the spot. I just never say which is which until the end of the session, and only if they ask, so by now they enjoy all cases: <br/><br/>-If they guessed my prep right it means they defeated me, so they celebrate.<br/>-If they found out I made it on the spot it means they thought something that I didn't, so they defeated me and thus, celebrate.<br/>-If I changed my prep for something they thought by themselves it means their idea was better than mine. They get their credit and go celebrate.<br/>-If they don't ask I know it's because they want to keep the illusion as they lived it so I respect that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also there's a natural ocurrence in human communication, <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-cognitive-bias-2794963" rel="nofollow">Cognitive Bias</a>. It means that there's no way to create a perfect mystery scenario that all kind of players will enjoy, will be able to satisfyingly solve or that it will flow like usual reference media does. Not all of the three at the same time, on 100% of the times at last. It can be the scenario itself, how convoluted is the reasoning needed to get to the solution, the GM's delivery of the information, etc. So, why bother? No wonder why the gumshoe approach came to be, as a reaction to all those CoC misadventures.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My apologies for the wall of text, but I'd like to add that I hate Not Knowing Rules. As in "Common Sense Things Your Character Should Know" but you don't as a player, in games where these things are the difference between a TPK and meeting a challenge in equal grounds. I'm even ok with learning these "rules" by getting my character killed several times, if that has been established openly as a rule from the start. Otherwise, playing to guess the right answer for the GM is pure frustation, and definitely not a game to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474480/#Comment_474480" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-06T00:21:44+00:00" title="June  6, 2018 12:21AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a kind of beautiful fevered creativity that unfolds when a group of players have no idea what's behind some kind of plot occurrence. Y'know, that thing where the GM puts a mystery in place, and the players come up with a weird conspiracy theory so enticing that the GM is tempted to swap it in as the actual explanation? I enjoy that, both seeing it and participating in it. <br/><br/>I'm not fond of not knowing what the parameters are of the fictional environment. Like, if this is a fantasy setting, how does the magic work, and are there gods, and etc? I'm OK with it if my character's not supposed to understand it \u2014 like, if I\u2019m a normal mundane dude in a secretly-magical setting. But if I'm playing a wizard, I need to know more or less what magic can do.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474543/#Comment_474543" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-07T19:42:40+00:00" title="June  7, 2018  7:42PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point. I am really growing to like sidebars where the designer steps out from behind the curtain and says, "Hey, this is how this is supposed to work, or at least how I like to think about it, and all the spells in the game were built around these assumptions."  <br/><br/>For example, I just started running Spire, a game which has two kinds of magic, divine and occult, basically the old cleric-vs-wizard thing. Except the sidebar then points out that there's not actually any functional difference between the two except you have to roll for occult magic and divine magic functions every time, and that IC some people think this means that the gods don't exist, divine magic is just codified magic. I really like that, it gave me a really clear way to think about magic in the game, plus some cool ideas about how people in the setting think about it. I wish more games had simple straight talk like this using the game mechanics, and just lots of in-universe talk about channeling forces and mantras and things.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474554/#Comment_474554" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-07T21:49:34+00:00" title="June  7, 2018  9:49PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is most satisfying to "play to find out". I've experimented with pre-defined story arcs but not knowing is more exciting.<br/><br/>But there is more to it if you take the player vs character perpective into account:<br/>1. Player + character don't know ("play to find out")<br/>2. Player knows + character doesn't know (staged play)<br/>3. Player + character know ("it's destiny")<br/>4. Player doesn't know + character knows (character discovery, mind games)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
