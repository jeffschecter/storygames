A concept half-baked enough it wasn't out of the oven yet, it would've made more sense as a blog entry or other more experimental arena.<br/><br/>Second, they created too big of a mismatch between FAE and Fate Core. I wish they would've matched each other better, one book a briefer version, the other a more fully explained version, of the same rules. Although, FAE did the right thing by combining the stress tracks, that should've been the default for FC too (with a note on how it sometimes is very valuable to have separate stress tracks) \u2014 or rather, I don't really care how many stress tracks there are, but they should've matched their defaults.<br/><br/><br/>Thirdly, for most English speakers using an adverbial phrase in the place of a verb phrase causes a predicate vacuum. Oh, you might say, the predicate slot is filled by the diegetic action. "I defeat the ninja quickly! I instantly become ruler of the galaxy cleverly! I distim those damned doshes quite forcefully! I frobnicate the quuxes gracefully! Oh, there's no way to do things gracefully, there's only male approaches? I guess flashily then."<br/><br/>3a: Sure, but then why even have the approaches at all? A +1 or +2 is gigantic on 4dF, it's like 20 percentile units. The approaches tend to override all circumstances. "Wait, you're flashily doing that? But there's no one here!\u201d<br/><br/>3b: They completely gum up all sense of intent, initiation, execution and effect, by 3ba Answering none of the four, but 3bb <em>looking</em> like they might do, thus getting in the way of answering them. Intent use: 'I get them to obey me, quickly!' Initiation use: 'I start to speak, quickly!' Execution use: 'I tell them about the death ray aimed at them, quickly!' Effect use: 'They cower before me, quickly!'<br/><br/>3c: They don't pull their weight. If they're as vague as they are, there's no use for a stat. You could just roll everything at a +0 and then make it easier or harder with your aspects.<br/><br/>3d: By changing the deep syntactical meaning of the stat, they create even more of a mismatch between FAE and Fate Core. They mesh better with things like some games that use a noun phrase to roll, like Dex or Strength. But\u2026 is adverbs really the word class to turn to before VP or NP?<br/><br/>3e: Since adverb use is typically more relative in English than noun or verb use, they give less of an impression of the character's capabilities. I scale Mount Everest, quickly. I struggle to even tie my shoelaces, quickly. I turn invisible and phase through walls, quickly. I attempt to chew a piece of gum, quickly.<br/><br/>4: When FAE first came out, I bemoaned that it was different from Fate Core, and that it lacked some of the explanations that I thought was crucial to Fate Core (how to set up scenes). But, over time, the approaches showed themselves to be something many groups struggled with. I read countless of blog posts and forum threads such as this one, that proposed to fix them, to codify adjudication of them with or without hacks to them. All to no avail. Well, good luck. Maybe you'll be the one.<br/><br/>5. They don't cover the bases. Where's attentively? Gracefully? Politely? Tenderly? Beautifully? Kindly? Validatingly? Are those qualities not valued? In FAE, it's the "guy way" or the highway, it seems.<br/><br/>6. For that matter, where is matter-of-factly, angrily, incineratingly, bureaucratically, frobnicatingly, completely, definitely, world-endingly? Adverbs are an open word class.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461795/#Comment_461795" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-08T14:06:15+00:00" title="April  8, 2017  2:06PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woah, thanks for the very complete answer! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>Some things I disagree with, others I definitely concur with.<br/>At any rate, all very interesting thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461797/#Comment_461797" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-08T14:27:21+00:00" title="April  8, 2017  2:27PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NP\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461798/#Comment_461798" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-08T15:23:19+00:00" title="April  8, 2017  3:23PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with pretty much all of Sandra's comments.<br/><br/>However, adding questions like these has the potential of rescuing the Approaches, I think, since it does lead to something concrete we can imagine and interact with.<br/><br/>It should be ensconced within a genre/game where that makes sense as well, though.

Flair, Focus, Force, Guile, Haste and Intellect.<br/><br/>I've also seen a couple of FAE-based games use Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.<br/><br/>These 'approaches' aren't adjectives (to be used adverbially) anymore, they're nouns, to be used in a way that conveys character capability. I don't think they should even be called approaches. DFAE also includes a variant of the scale factor from the original Fudge. So that a tiny bug can have Great strength but still be squashed by a big dog with Weak Strength.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna" title="CarlosLuna"><img alt="CarlosLuna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/043/n8G0MTMMVZLJN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna">CarlosLuna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461847/#Comment_461847" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-10T15:15:08+00:00" title="April 10, 2017  3:15PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the original topic, the best approach-hack I've seen so far is <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavidGoodwin/posts/Mdw9oLUEhej" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. Perhaps you could reuse some of David's ideas to inspire your questions.<br/><br/>For example, it makes a lot of sense that trying to be XX makes you not being YY enough. This also means that the GM has always 5 questions available (related with the unused approaches) instead of just one (related with the used approach):<br/><br/><i>Ok, you are trying to be quick... that means that you are not being careful enough, what are you overlooking?</i><br/><br/>Or<br/><br/><i>Ok, you are doing that forcefully... that means that you are not being sneaky enough, who has just noticed you?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462361/#Comment_462361" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-23T23:02:26+00:00" title="April 23, 2017 11:02PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2017 11:03PM by BeePeeGee.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hasimir, I really like using questions for approaches. I think it is a good idea that the questions expose a downside of using a specific approach. This way, maybe players are encouraged to think twice before simply choosing their strongest approach, i.e. doing something forceful limits the use of subtlety, doing it in a flashy way draws attention... These could potentially be used against them further down the line.<br/><br/>What is good question for clever? Tricky. Maybe "What price do you pay for being clever?" (i.e. appearing arrogant...).<br/><br/>Personally, my experience is that some genres/settings work very well with FAE approaches and some don't work at all.<br/>I like this discussion about alternatives:<br/><a href="http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2015/09/fae-q-approach-alts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2015/09/fae-q-approach-alts/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PatrickRBG" title="PatrickRBG"><img alt="PatrickRBG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PatrickRBG">PatrickRBG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462413/#Comment_462413" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-24T20:03:45+00:00" title="April 24, 2017  8:03PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use FAE for a scifi horror game and we treat the approaches as what is gain/sacrificed based on the roll.
