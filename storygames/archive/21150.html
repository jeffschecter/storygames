There are about half a dozen noteworthy post-Forgite designers here, which isn't bad for the size of the country. Everybody's got plenty of people to play with, and artistic accomplishment occurs. We meet occasionally face to face, and play regularly with our own local groups.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World and freeform influences aren't even dominant in the scene I'm familiar with here, locally. Rather, the cutting edge with us is something I like to call neo-forgite design: dynamic combinations of formalistic systems, particularly pacing and structural rules, with carefully considered fruitful voids. Some people putter about with AW variants and similar hybrids, and I imagine that there must be some freeform work somewhere as well, but maybe I just don't meet those people as often as I do the neo-Forgites.<br/><br/>Considering the wider picture, I've personally found the international scene a bit fractured this decade; I read Story Games out of habit, but it seems like I have my hands full with the Finnish stuff, and only rarely designers from farther out attract my attentions. It's not like there isn't people out there interested in the same things, but it doesn't seem like we need as much mutual interaction as we used to, either. I feel like there's often more energy and ambition in the Finnish scene than the international one, but that might be because I'm seeing more games done to my taste locally, while the international stuff often seems sort of blase in comparison - endless AW recycling, and not as much technical flair as I like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463575/#Comment_463575" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-27T15:16:39+00:00" title="May 27, 2017  3:16PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although there has been a lot of attention given to PbtA hacks, I see great new games cropping up all the time.

They often don't have good advice for how to create good stories and good endings. They also don't have good advice or mechanics for when people incorporate story elements that are discordant or destroy verisimilitude.  Instead they say, no matter what the other player says is it's a good idea and not to have any method for arbitration. Archipelago has a fairly good mechanic to address this called "try a different way." Still, I don't think the reason to go a different way is made explicit enough in Archipelago and certainly not in other games. Games need to emphasize that how you play is as important as the mechanics, and they need to integrate mechanics to back this up. They must value the contributions of others foremost; you don't just veto an idea because you had a different idea for the story or don't like the idea creatively. But  sometimes having a conversation about what is been introduced in the story is important; it's important to care about the story on a whole because it affects the whole game for everyone, and if it a discordant idea ruins it or an element makes a coherent ending impossible it's to nobody's good.  Also, the advice for how to end Games is just as important as the mechanics. Games now are very lacking in good mechanics on how to wrap up Games and they're lacking on the good advice on how to create a satisfying ending and even how to structure a satisfying story. Some games don't require as much advice because the mechanics work so well that they take care of the problem  largely on their own. I believe that Fiaco is one of the games with a single caveat, which is: when you decide whether a character gets what they want, you always frame  what they want from their character's perspective. A character could want something that is disastrous or stupid, but from their perspective it looks good; I have never had an unsuccessful Fiasco game when I framed whether the character gets what they want from the character's perspective, and I played tons of Fiasco. Also, when you do this, players most often choose the yes or no option that is best for the story and creates the most interesting and satisfying story, Fiasco also has the advantage of putting players on the same page because the type of story you tell in it and the type of tone it has is made explicit. This is the other area where Story Games often fail. People often want to tell a different type of story from one another, and the tones clash. Someone wants to tell a story which is funny, silly and whimsical; and someone else, wants to tell a story that is dark, serious,  and intense;  and the result, is that because they started with different expectations everyone ends up unsatisfied with the story. I believe it is absolutely essential that players get on the same page  regarding what type of tone the story will have and what type of story they are going to tell. I am creating mechanics and advice to rectify these issues in my game of courtly intrigue, [House Of Spiders], and I believe I will be successful. Anyway, that's my two cents. BTW, Story Games Seattle and Story Games SLC only play GMless, collaborative Story Games. There are also other Story Games (city name)  that follow the same model. There are hundreds and hundreds of these games, and I believe that they are actually fairly popular right now; especially, if you know where to look.

I own a lot more of these games than I provide in the following list and I can provide more if you are interested, but these are the the type of GMless Story Games I'm talking about. Some of these games address the issues I talked about above, and are successful to a greater or less degree, at dealing with them; however, on a whole these games, which I refer to as Story Games, could be greatly improved in regard to these issues. For clarification, I define Story Games the same way the Ben Robbins does; if you are interested in this definition please see the link below: <br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/</a><br/><br/>Again, these games are my favorite type of games, and they are all we play at Story Games SLC. These games, on the whole, are innovative and they are wonderful; I love these games\u2014and when I'm talking about improvements I'm talking about Story Games as a whole, not these games in particular; these are just examples of the types of games I'm talking about. Some of these games do a good job at handling these issues; for example, as I mentioned above, Fiasco. Here's a list of the type of games I'm talking about:<br/><br/>Fall of magic <br/>While the world ends <br/>Swords without master<br/>A taste for murder<br/>Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands<br/>Intrepid<br/>The King is Dead<br/>Left Coast: the Short Story edition<br/>The Deep Forest<br/>Archipelago II<br/>Archipelago III<br/>Amidst Endless Quiet <br/>House of Reeds <br/>Geiger Counter <br/>Preserverant  <br/>Nicotine Girls <br/>Sign in Stranger <br/>Nod<br/>Dog Eat Dog<br/>1001 nights <br/>Kagematsu <br/>Serpent's tooth <br/>Life on Mars<br/>Eden <br/>Shinobigamy<br/>Mars Colony 39 Dark<br/>Mars Colony<br/>Ribbon Drive<br/>Steal Away Jordan <br/>Contenders <br/>The Shan-Al-Hari Roach (&amp; The Roach Returns!)<br/>Hot Guys Making Out <br/>Love in the Time of Seid<br/>A Penny For My Thoughts<br/>S/lay w/me<br/>Agon<br/>Shock: social science fiction<br/>Lovecraftesque<br/>Annalisa<br/>Puppet land <br/>Universalis <br/>Inspecters<br/>Polaris<br/>Dread<br/>Kingdom<br/>Microscope (&amp; microscope explore)<br/>Durance<br/>Carolina Death Crawl<br/>Follow<br/>Fiasco (&amp; Fiasco companion and Fiasco  playset ontology volume 1, 2, &amp; 3)<br/>Mountsegur 1244<br/>Remember tomorrow<br/>The society of dreamers<br/>Downfall<br/>Zombie cinema<br/>Okult<br/>FateLess <br/>Serpent's tooth<br/>Life on Mars<br/>Primetime adventures<br/>The quiet year<br/>The hour between dog and wolf <br/>Showdown <br/>Faith<br/>Our last best hope (&amp; OLBH expansion)<br/>The Drifter's Escape<br/>Spione <br/>Shahida <br/>Companions' Tale<br/>Bacchanal <br/>Escape from tentacle city<br/>Norwegian style guide<br/>Hell for Leather<br/>Conspire<br/>Witch: The road to Lindisfarne<br/>The republic<br/>Home by dark<br/>Final Hour of a storied age<br/>Sweet Agatha <br/>Karma<br/>The Impostors<br/>Sign in stranger <br/>Love in the Time of Sied <br/>Love in the Time of Khvareneh<br/>What you wish for <br/>My daughter, the queen of France<br/>Mind of Margaret<br/>Tall Pines<br/>Dialect<br/>Meridian <br/>Lost in the Rain<br/>Something to hide<br/><br/>For a longer list check out my "Ultimate List of GMless Games" post here:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20920/the-ultimate-list-of-gmless-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20920/the-ultimate-list-of-gmless-games</a><br/><br/>Again, there are many more games than in the list above and the post above; if you would like me to provide more examples, to get an exhaustive list of the games being developed and played in the scene,  I will be happy to do so. To learn more about the scene you could go to Story Games Seattle's website, which is probably the best exemplar of the scene, they have 754 members; so there are places where the scene is definitely thriving. Ben has created something that is very impressive and admirable and done a lot to bring more exposure to these games and to get people playing them. Story Games SLC, which is my group, is modeled on Story Games Seattle, but is currently a much more modest gaming organization; but, as they say, from small beginnings come great things. I plan to purchase a specific Meetup for Story Games SLC, as Ben has done with his organization, instead of piggybacking off of another Meetup  group. I'm also creating a website, and the Story Games SLC press (for games designed and published by the members). I think that doing the things I discussed above, as well as some other things, will enlarge the scene in Salt Lake City, which I am very dedicated to doing.  I also think that if the games I'm currently developing and will publish in the future\u2014for example, [House of Spiders]\u2014gain traction and popularity, I may be able to use this to draw more people into SGSLC. I think the popularity of Ben's games has certainly contributed to the success of SGS. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm getting a bit off topic.

Instead, it was \u201c1. Do this. 2. Then do this, 3. Then do this\u201d. Clarity.</p>\n<p>And, and, and\u2026. one more thing I really enjoy in story games. There\u2019s often some tension that the rules create and enforce.</p>\n<p>I found these things in the OSR too. To a lesser extent, but an ahistorical OSR with a strict \u201creferee ethos\u201d, everything rolled openly etc\u2026 it also gave me those two things. The clear instructions (\u201cRoll for wandering monsters every second turn\u201d), the mechanically created tension (HP, encounter checks).</p>\n<p>What I\u2019m playing now is a mashup of Dramasystem and D&amp;D. With one GM. Except the mashup makes sense to me, unlike the old trad which, <strong>to me</strong>, was confusing, incoherent and full of \u201cimpossible things\u201d and contradictions. I\u2019m thinking of this as \u201crediscovered trad, but no <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?OnionInTheVarnish" rel="nofollow">onion in the varnish</a>\u201d. Playing in a game that shares the <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow">adventure game</a>, \u201cfirst person\u201d feel of trad but that has been careful to keep the recipe and the reproducibility at hand. A codified practice rather than something that was passed on through osmosis and older siblings and secret cargo cult tips.</p>\n<p>Because as I\u2019ve said before, when I first started trying to learn roleplaying games, I didn\u2019t get it. So the first couple of years was just pure confusion, then I just started improvising and freeforming, and then I finally discovered story games and lastly came full circle with an OSR that has kept giving me \u201cAha, so <em>that</em> was how that thing was supposed to work\u201d\u2013experiences.</p>\n<p>All that said, I\u2019m still interested in exploring some of these classic story games (or new ones) to elaborate on setting detail for our main campaign. (I\u2019ve mentioned before the example of using Microscope Chronicle to tell the story of that one dinar with the chipped edge.) I\u2019m calling the project \u201c1001 Nights Off\u201d.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463963/#Comment_463963" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T15:48:22+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  3:48PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2017 3:49PM by Airk.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am playing more "Story Games" than ever, because of all the reasons they were created: Time, commitment, etc.  It's still way easier to make a game of Fall of Magic happen than it is to to spin up some sort of GM'd oneshot, even in an OSR system, even if I were remotely interested in the OSR mentality, which I am... not.

While it puts people on the spot, there is no high skill threshold: you don't need to make up anything smart or good, it's still valid. The game is giving power to people who, in an OSR game, would be evaluated based on their performance and who would give in to the experienced/alpha players. The ban on suggestions liberates the weak/the shy/the newbs to speak up without being forced to compromise with the overbearing alphas. The game even protects their contributions by making them visible to anyone and hard to ignore. Even the simultaneous voting mechanism forces everyone to think independently. Microscope is definitely not a game about consensus, but it's a game very heavy on collaboration. <br/><br/>I dislike consensus building in RPGs, personally, it always seems to end with the most abrasive player getting his way. I dislike it even when that player is me.<br/><br/>Granted, Microscope is not the cuddliest game in the world either, but it's much more protective compared to OSR. Many people want their game tougher, obviously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464014/#Comment_464014" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T11:46:59+00:00" title="June 15, 2017 11:46AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MOD VOICE:<br/><br/>I think trying to hash out "the [OSR/story-games/trad] community is like this" is an exercise that's going to be both full of large, probably unfair, generalizations, and also lead nowhere good.<br/><br/>So let's not continue in that direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464015/#Comment_464015" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T11:49:50+00:00" title="June 15, 2017 11:49AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2017 12:24PM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you James<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Whoops, didn't mean for that "Thank you" to come across as a dig against Upstart.

There's no attempt at inclusiveness in it as a game text, at least not of the sort that I would notice.<br/><br/>Despite that, it is also true that a game like Microscope is more decorous and covert about its goals than the sort of hardcore D&amp;D that Upstart's thinking of, above. (I should note that he's probably thinking of the sort of D&amp;D I and some other people here in Finland play - I understand his experiences with OSR D&amp;D are mostly in that scene.) For instance, a rule common to games like Microscope is that the players take turns to contribute, which is something that macho D&amp;D militates against in the interest of letting the best players lead. It is not wrong to say that Microscope is more egalitarian and people-respecting than the blood-thirstiest sorts of D&amp;D out there. (I hope I am being clear that this is not all D&amp;D that I'm describing - there's plenty of fluffier varieties as well.)<br/><br/>It's an intricate field of issues, and lumping them all into one continuum of machismo is probably not the way to get a clear sense of it all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464019/#Comment_464019" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T12:26:07+00:00" title="June 15, 2017 12:26PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm all about that Taschenlampenfallenlasser                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464024/#Comment_464024" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T13:46:48+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  1:46PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this whole discussion is a little off kilter (Well, as usual, except for Eero, who seems to hit it with that last post)  You can't make a game inclusive any more than you can make a game that forces people to play by the rules.   At the end of the day, inclusiveness or lack of it is about the people.  <br/><br/>All that said, there are a few things that can help;  Microscope's choice to not allow other people to give you suggestions means that people have to cooperate in a way that doesn't involve just telling other people what to do - which is a big problem in cooperative games with any sort of mastery involved (See Pandemic, where games with experienced players and new players usually devolve into the experienced players just telling the new players what to do.)   People can mitigate this, but in a highly skill based and punishing game, they can hurt their own game experiences by doing so, when the newbie sets off a trap that mangles half the party.  You can mitigate THAT by being nice and supportive and not taking things too seriously.  I kinda get the feeling OSR takes itself pretty seriously overall, however.  At least, based on the scorn it tends to heap on other types of games.<br/><br/>You can also make the penalties for "lack of skill" less punishing - OSR does the opposite of this. If you're a dumbass and set off a trap and it kills you, go sit on the couch and play Xbox for a while until a point comes along where you can add a character back into the game.  Storygames don't tend to sideline a player in this way, which can be more supportive.  The downside is that a person can still drag down the experience for everyone involved by doing discordant stuff, but in general I find that is something that's more easily compensated for by a conversation -  "Hey, you just introduced  and that seems kinda jarring and doesn't really fit in; How can we make it work?" - rather than "well, you just killed half the party because you didn't listen to Alex when they told you what to do." which is pretty much not reparable, and you just have to grin and bear it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464026/#Comment_464026" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T15:00:50+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  3:00PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We play with the rule that you get your new character right away                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464028/#Comment_464028" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T15:17:33+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  3:17PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That helps a lot, but can be jarring to a lot of people. "Wait. Where did this new guy come from when we're in the depths of a lost tomb that we only just figured out how to enter, and is three weeks from the nearest town."  It also potentially causes the issue that it undercuts a lot of what I suspect OSR wants to be about - if Fred the Fighter dies, and Bob the Fighter spontaneously appears to replace him, the party hasn't really lost anything. They haven't been weakened by the decisions that caused Fred to die. <br/><br/>FWIW, I agree with you, but that's only because when I am playing OSR-ish dungeon crawly games where I'm likely to be in a lost tomb miles from nowhere, it's because I want to kill some monsters, I don't really care about the lost "verisimilitude" of having a new character appear when one dies.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464039/#Comment_464039" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T21:22:57+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  9:22PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah\u2026 we're doing pretty post-OSR OSR <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sweat_smile.png" title=":sweat_smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464052/#Comment_464052" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T23:25:28+00:00" title="June 15, 2017 11:25PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a sidenote, Airk:<br/><br/>"The party hasn't really lost anything" is only true if the characters haven't leveled up or otherwise improved their abilities.

Sometimes they get stuck in a deathtrap, get separated from the group, kidnapped, swallowed alive, or the thing that killed them destroys the valuables they were carrying anyway (e.g. dragon breath hitting a character carrying a map). Often, character death means that the other characters are running away in a panic.<br/><br/>I've seen some pretty "serious" OSR-style games which just accepted the necessary ridiculousness of introducing new characters in unlikely ways - including a game where a new character was simply "found" in a treasure chest, with no memory of how he got there. Surprisingly, the group got so used to it that it didn't feel arbitrary to them: they accepted it as a necessary price for the inclusion of all players at all times.<br/><br/>I spent some time in an earlier thread considering an OSR-style game where the number of people available for adventuring at all is effectively the party's long-term "hit points":<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20498/the-mindflayer-s-matrix" rel="nofollow">The Mindflayer's Matrix</a><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464109/#Comment_464109" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T23:04:14+00:00" title="June 16, 2017 11:04PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The map doesn't just vanish when Bob dies.
