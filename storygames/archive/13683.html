Set up a map and cross off sections every 15 minutes, slowly herding all the towns folk together into one place for a final scene (bonus points if everyone dies at the end).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309490/#Comment_309490" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T08:06:56+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  8:06AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this herding idea.

Kind of start in mid-action, perhaps, with, say, a group of townspeople about to execute one Dog's sister under the leadership of a second Dog.<br/><br/>It'd be tricky to make it work right, especially with strangers, but the benefit would be that the players would be more engaged with gameplay. A lot of Dogs conflicts mean the other players are sitting out, waiting for their scene. By putting Dogs on both sides of conflicts, you have twice as much player involvement in any given scene.<br/><br/>And definitely skip initiations, unless you can tie them really, really, really tightly into the Town. (E.g. the Dogs aren't traveling together, but arrive in the Town separately. Each "initiation" is the opening scene for that character with a major Town NPC, as they enter the Town. In scene two, they all meet up in the Town square, ready to make a plan of action.) (Oh, and maybe make those initiation scenes action scenes, like a murderer fleeing from the scene of the crime, so the second scene is already imbued with a sense of urgency.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309503/#Comment_309503" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T09:17:36+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  9:17AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am pretty frowny about this, I don't think I could get a grasp on what Dogs is about in 2 hours no matter what you did, maybe I am just dumb and the people at PAX will be smart?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309505/#Comment_309505" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T09:34:13+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  9:34AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I am pretty frowny about this, I don't think I could get a grasp on what Dogs is about in 2 hours no matter what you did, maybe I am just dumb and the people at PAX will be smart?</blockquote>\nWhat parts do you think are most difficult to absorb / experience / understand in 2 hours?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309511/#Comment_309511" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T09:50:52+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  9:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a href="/forums/profile/jason">@jason</a>:</b><br/><br/>agreed, if initiation scenes couldn't be integrated in a way that also reveals the town in play, I would consider not using them (although I do love them).<br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/profile/mease19">@mease19</a> <a href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">@MatrixGamer</a> <a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a> T:</b><br/><br/>Based on all your feedback, what if...<br/><br/>I announce the Town's problem... why you are all here.<br/><br/>I hand out pre-gens with Names, Backgrounds, and Gear pre-selected.<br/><br/>Then I put out 2 shared sheets of paper. 1 with a list of Traits that tie into the Town. A second with a list of all the Town's major NPCs and Sins. <br/><br/>Players choose their Traits and Relationships from the above. Each player must share at least 2 Relationships. I encourage them to leave some Trait and Relationship dice unassigned to define in play.<br/><br/>Start playing!<br/><br/>Taking inspiration from Initiation Scenes, every player has an individual solo scene. The idea is you all know each other but traveled from different locations so you each get 1 scene in the Town by yourself. The scene must include an NPC you have a relationship with. And I will push for a conflict to showcase how the basic rules work. <br/><br/>After every solo scene in town is done, you are all together.<br/><br/>Additionally, I will really boil down the town to its essence and minimize distractions where possible.

Of course, as GM you're throwing information at them everywhere they go, and trying to get them in the know as quick as possible, but I find players still like to talk to everyone and get a sense of the different sides in a troubled town. It is important too, for developing sympathy for the townsfolk, making it feel real, and for bringing out some of the more subtle interactions between the Dogs. But it's also time consuming, and less interesting in a convention context, I think. I often find myself flat out saying "all the cards are on the table" to prompt things to move towards resolution.<br/><br/>I wonder if you could jump-start the game by having a reliable source give the characters the low-down on the town right at the start? Maybe one of the Dogs gets a letter from a sibling telling them all about what's going on? And you can explicitly tell the players "everything in this letter is 100% true, I am not jerking you around".<br/><br/>You'd lose some subtlety, and I think folks would still want to chat to people a bit, but it might cut down on the long conversations that drag out the game, and move straight to the hard choices and judgement that the game is about.

But you've gotta sacrifice something to fit a whole town into 2 hours.<br/><br/>The solution here is exactly what we're discussing:<br/><br/>Get the players to own the problems in the Town but enlisting them in the NPC/Town creation process. A few simple, leading questions, a strong simple setup (Hate &amp; Murder, that's the ticket), and a few options for the players to choose for the NPCs will get them riled up in no time.<br/><br/>In my Lady Blackbird hack, I list all the NPCs and ask questions like, "Which one of these is rumoured to be a cannibal? Which one is incredibly good-looking?" It gets them involved in the NPCs right away, imagining stuff about them. For a Dogs town, it could be a list of the main NPCs, and then, "Brother Jebediah, you've heard terrible stories about one of these people's unlawful sexual behaviour. Who is it, and what did you hear?"<br/><br/>That allows you to use your preset relationship map, just putting a twist on the rumours. (Say the player thinks Sister Josie is sleeping with the Steward. In the first scene, he finds out that, no, she's actually sleeping with the Doctor. Or the Steward is having an affair, etc.) It gives the players something to start on (e.g. accusing Sister Josie, who, remember, is one of the Dogs' sister/mother/daughter/girlfriend) but also still leaves them something to discover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309583/#Comment_309583" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T14:48:57+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  2:48PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>For me, that crosses a line regarding who has authority over what in Dogs.
