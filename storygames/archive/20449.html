Sometimes it's because a particular system clearly has a different outlook on this than what I am used. Looking at you Apocalypse World. Other times, it's because a system doesn't really take a stance and relies on the traditional GM invocation, in which case it falls to me to decide "Ok, I need to call for a roll," or "this is a situation that doesn't require a roll."<br/><br/>Over the years, and discussions elsewhere, I've come to find my stance on this tends to be rather different from others. So, I'm curious to hear how you story-gamers view this concept. 1) When do you call for a roll when GMing a game? <br/>2) When designing a system, what do you ask yourself when deciding on what triggers a roll in that system? <br/><br/>Do you find that your answer to 1 is often different from 2? Or, do you try to make most games you run play like games you design?<br/><br/>A really interesting take on this would be Blades, the GM just really doesn't call for a roll if they can help it. I always wondered why the game focused up in that way; I'm assuming it was because Stress is such a bastard and the point is to try and let players pick their poison.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449672/#Comment_449672" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-21T18:22:46+00:00" title="November 21, 2015  6:22PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The short version is that every game is different. As a designer (and as a reader of any other game), the first thing I want to be really clear about is HOW and WHEN certain procedures (like rolling dice) are invoked.<br/><br/>I even designed a game where, in each scene, there is a player whose only purpose is to decide when the dice are rolled (and they are rewarded if they choose well). So, it's definitely a very important consideration.<br/><br/>More importantly, I think a good game (rulebook/guide/player/group) should really get into the WHY: how do we know a good moment to invoke a procedure, and to what end?<br/><br/>A perfect example:<br/><br/>In Apocalypse World, "going aggro" seems to be a pretty clear "fictional trigger" - someone pulls out a weapon or puts up a fist and they threaten someone to do what they want.<br/><br/>We all know what that looks like.<br/><br/>However, a lot of people forget the complete implication of the rule: once you roll the dice, you can no longer "pull your punches" - the procedure commits you to delivering harm to your victim (if they so choose).<br/><br/>This means it's easy to trigger this move at the wrong time: the true launching-point of the move is not just threatening someone with harm... it's threatening someone with harm and being 100% committed to following through - you've got past the point of just threatening or manipulating or intimidating someone: you're all the way to fully committed violence.<br/><br/>This says something important about Apocalypse World and how it operates: you can't really get what you want unless you follow through with violence.<br/><br/>But a lot of people miss that, and then they have awkward moments at the table: they roll and they go through and then the player says, "Wait! Wait! I don't want to kill the guy, I was just threatening him!" And now you have to do over. You screwed up the procedure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/murphy_slaw" title="murphy_slaw"><img alt="murphy_slaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/676/nF0XOU5ZYI0AL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/murphy_slaw">murphy_slaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449674/#Comment_449674" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-21T18:35:25+00:00" title="November 21, 2015  6:35PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In games where most rolls are skill or ability checks, I only call for a roll if the consequences of failure are interesting.

If the answer is yes to both, roll it up!<br/>2) Do I, without doubt, know the outcome of the attempted action? If so, they don't gotta roll. Their character will perform the action, I'll narrate the inevitable result. I.e. you can't deadlift a starship without a mech suit.<br/>3) Criteria One carries more weight than criteria 2.  Maybe I'm positive they can't lift a starship, but maybe the player can narrate themselves out of this hole, if so, let em roll.<br/>4) Provided the situation has not changed drastically, and unless the game specifies otherwise, the action of the scene should be resolved in one roll. For example, roll once to stealth through the building, unless a specific part of the house is loaded with traps, a specialized defense grid, unusually increased guard presence in a specific location, etc.   The last addendum to this criteria is that the one roll method should not affect game balance or take some of the "special" out of another class/archetype/build. For example: a Rogue stealthing through a house would only need to make one roll. The wizard might have to make 2, cause he's not a trained infiltrator.<br/><br/>Ok, so those are my crazy rules for invoking rolls.<br/><br/>Now, a friend of mine told me his method, which i actually like better and attempt to use more often. But, like I says, when in doubt, I default to the criteria above. To grossly paraphrase:<br/><br/>He doesn't call for a roll if success OR failure would be ludicrous. For example, no way a rogue would fail stealthing by a stupid shopkeep, he's a freaking rogue. Likewise, i dont care what you narrate, without a mech suit you can't lift a starship.<br/><br/>I like this, it's simple, succinct, easy to follow.  Buuut, I'm still more of a narrative bent, if it's interesting and you (the player) can make it interesting, sure.. why not?<br/><br/>p.s. hope this makes sense, im at work today, so im trying to quickly type stuff up on my phone in my downtime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449680/#Comment_449680" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-21T20:59:50+00:00" title="November 21, 2015  8:59PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're just talking about traditional task resolution (in games like D&amp;D, where you make a roll to see if your character could accomplish a task successfully), I'd recommend this article:<br/><br/><a href="http://angrydm.com/2013/04/adjudicate-actions-like-a-boss/" rel="nofollow">Adjudicate Actions Like a Motherf$&amp;%ing Boss!</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449682/#Comment_449682" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-21T21:08:57+00:00" title="November 21, 2015  9:08PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2015 9:17PM by Luzelli.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, originally this came from a discussion on traditional task resolution, because most of the people i know run dnd pretty exclusively. But really, I noticed that, as a neophyte designer, I have wholly different priorities when I'm trying to decide what triggers a roll. <br/><br/>For example:<br/>The few things I've designed have been pretty light-weight, focusing on narrative to the exclusion of crunch. In these situations, I very specifically chose certain roll triggers that fit within the context of the narrative the game was trying to foster. I had one game that was all about the players being a band of rebels against a highly repressive and controlling regime, the trigger to roll was certain fictive choices that played into the espionage type actions a rebel outfit like that would have to undertake. Everything else was left as, meh, it's just narrated.<br/><br/>The companion to that, players played the oppressive regime hunting down rebels. There, the characters were built and based around a particular sense of honor. The only time they rolled is when their honor was at stake. Not necessarily for combat, but if the actions being taken (by them or the NPCs) was putting their personal code at stake.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449686/#Comment_449686" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-21T21:50:38+00:00" title="November 21, 2015  9:50PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2015 9:52PM by BeePeeGee.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My main rule (for a resolution roll) is: "If you don't like the answer - don't ask the question".<br/>This is especially true when you have a situation where the GM absolutely wants a certain result or everyone is on board that they want to see a certain result - then go with it and skip the roll.<br/>Unless you play a specific genre that requires it (i.e. some horror settings), the simple question is: "is there a dice roll that would disappoint everyone?"  - if yes, don't do it.<br/><br/>Something between rolling and <i>not</i> rolling: You know "what" should basically succeed but you don't know "how well" this will succeed.
