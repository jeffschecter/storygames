The difference from the game quoted is that I'm specifically looking for a real quick procedure to help the GM group create a room in a few minutes. Its okay if you quote tabletop games as long as they don't include automated challenges but some sort of GM created/controlled ones.<br/><br/>Also, as a GM have you tried giving another out of sce PC the control of a monster? What were your experiences with that? If there isn't such a game out there I think I'll start making it anyway...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441017/#Comment_441017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-23T20:11:14+00:00" title="December 23, 2014  8:11PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robin Law's <i>Rune</i> comes to mind.

Apart from the youtube video linked above, I believe he describes it in more detail in his book: Play Dirty.<br/><br/>Basically, players can create dungeon elements (like rooms, monsters, traps or even treasure) by researching it in-game (rumors, libraries etc.). For each thing that would make their life more difficult, they get a die added into a bowl. During the dungeon run, they can spend those dice to boost any test. <br/><br/>I also believe that labyrinths and lycanthropes lets you generate a dungeon using a deck of cards. Even that I have the game from a bundle long time ago, I have never read it, so I only have a general idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441035/#Comment_441035" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-24T18:28:09+00:00" title="December 24, 2014  6:28PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Labyrinths and Lycanthropes is great, and easy to use for pick-up play, but I wouldn't say the game is "about" making dungeons\u2014it's more about making terrible puns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441041/#Comment_441041" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-26T03:13:52+00:00" title="December 26, 2014  3:13AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2014 5:14AM by DavidVS.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A free non-story maze-making game is Ambagibus.<br/> <a href="http://www.fecundity.com/pmagnus/ambagibus.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fecundity.com/pmagnus/ambagibus.php</a><br/><br/>It might be easy to enhance in the way you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441214/#Comment_441214" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-06T22:18:03+00:00" title="January  6, 2015 10:18PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/drowning-and-falling/" rel="nofollow">Drowning and Falling</a> has players create challenges for each other using playing cards.

I just started a 5e D&amp;D campaign using things from this post and other places.<br/><br/>Funny thing: so far I decided not to give players any incentive for adding things to the game. No extra dice for adding stuff, no xp, nothing. I'm avoiding the Czege principle by letting them enjoy the creation of a world without pushing the things they create as challenges yet (well, it's kinda easy now since we're just beggining). And it's working wonders! <br/><br/>Looks like it's the first time for most of the players to start a campaign like this, we have three veteran players and four newbies, but it made no difference. A few minutes into the first session everyone was quite engaged in the creation of the world. They started by being gods creating their concept, cult and traditions. Then they become kings and shaped their countries. I added a bit of random at defining things like amount of followers, economy and population, so the newbies got easily familiarized with interpretating the dice into fiction.<br/><br/>Most of my work was about connecting things. Suddenly a history of the setting started to arise while we created the world, but it's still full of mistery. An ancient continent where magic was powerful become the grave of the god of war. A legendary hero was accounted resposible for that, but the facts aren't clear. The death of the god destroyed the whole continent and refugees that barely escaped ended founding another country and creating warforged to supply their now short manpower.<br/><br/>In time they started selling armies, which brought ruin to a league of feudal states whose economy was based on the exportation of mercenary armies. Fact after fact started clicking in place and now players are so invested in the setting that they are still adding things to it while waiting for the next session. They know they are going to be in there are level 1 adventurers, and yet they are already asking for Balrogs!<br/><br/>The only slow part of the session was the character creation, which still hasn't finished. We haven't gone yet trhough the backgrounds process but I already explained them roughly what's that about.<br/><br/>Next I'll have them create the main villains of the setting in secret. Since we have 7 players I was planning to have one of them play the villain of the day on each session. Each time a different player with roleplay his villain and try to meet an objective with a limited amount of resources, but that will be only when everyone is more accustomed to the game mechanics.<br/><br/>I'm also keeping at hand a set of cards that allows players whose characters are out of the scene to intervene in the scene by adding details, roleplaying npcs or monsters or even helping any side of the conflicts with successful rolls and situational advantage. I'll let you know how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442411/#Comment_442411" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-03T03:33:24+00:00" title="February  3, 2015  3:33AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            sounds awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442413/#Comment_442413" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-03T04:13:28+00:00" title="February  3, 2015  4:13AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason Lutes is in the process of making a variety of random generators for Dungeon World, but it could adapt to 5e pretty easily.

Yes David, I mentioned HtHD on my first post. That, Burning wheel and Microscope gave me the whole idea.<br/><br/>Update on our game:<br/><br/>Last player to incorporate to the party added a goddess of justice and light... which we determined happens to be the twin of the goddess of intrigue and deception. The cult of the goddess of the light happens to be weak, which coul only mean that her evil sister keeps meddling with her affairs, after all when the goddess appears to anyone, nobody can tell which one is this time.<br/><br/>Players are still contributing on our FB group with material for every country and religion, details about the cult, economic and politics. Some others are posting memes about the last session. My GF added some links to soundtracks. And then out of the blue one guy shared a song, which I coupled with a random image I found googling "concept art", to create a sort of "teaser" for upcomig sessions. Both things happened to spark additional ideas a little, and now I'm posting a few more images related to characters they have created or places and events that I think could be interesting.<br/><br/>So far, brainstorming things has been as much fun (and maybe more fun) than playing, though the game is also creating material I'll be incorporating later. Now, thess "teasers" between sessions are looking quite effective to keep things rolling until the next sunday.<br/><br/>We've just finished with the map of the whole setting, which I'll be printing tonigh I hope, along with the miniatures and the new version of a deck meant to give players something to do while their characters are out of the scene, like controlling NPCs, adding details to the scenes, giving PCs and NPCs opportunities and additional tactical choices to make encounters more interesting. I can't wait to see what will plyers come up with. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442802/#Comment_442802" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T20:57:10+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  8:57PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, that sounds really cool, but are you actually making a dungeon?

I've got 6 different entries on each card and for each room the players get in I draw a few and take one entry of each.<br/><br/>They are (in no particular order)<br/>-Shape of the room<br/>-Visible exit (if any)<br/>-Details noticed with a good perception roll<br/>-Trigger of a trap (only used when I'd like to include one)<br/>-Nature of the trap<br/>-Event in the room<br/><br/>Why cards and not random tables? Cards are two seconds faster, and believe me, players really appreciate when your description is done in a fluid way without too much "err..." or uncomfortable silences. Heck, even comfortable silences kill the mood a bit, it's like waiting for a video to buffer up on the internet. It doesn't have the potential to stall the game anyway, but while not exactly annoying, whatever good emotional flow you had with the previous scene will reduce it's speed while you're cheking the tables and interpretating them. And you will lose a bit of the shock you could get with a quick response.<br/><br/>The second reason is that you're not limited to a number of choices like when using dice (of course, you can roll a d100 on a table with 82 or some items, but again you will be limited to a 100 of choices and will have to ressort to a sub-table or add another dice to get 1000 options and so... but that's another roll to make and read -see my previous point about that)<br/><br/>When I tested it before I got a cool scene with a door which erupted with an area fire spell when illuminated. A couple members of the party got their hair on fire until the wizard deciphered the runes. The writing went along the lines of "Let yourself be swallowed by the darkness, for it protects us from danger" and inmediatly stated thinking of the dungeon as a sort of trial for a thief guild. The next room was a spheric one with a well in the middle, except that only the wind was blowing from the well... in a rhytmic fashion. Above the well was hanging a glass orb. At that point everyone froze and looked at the party rogue.<br/><br/>The whole couple of scenes went quick and the players only made rolls for saves. They were able to decipher the trap mechanic by themselves after some trial and observation.<br/><br/>However what I'm looking for now is to be able to create a dungeon with a story, with some actual background that helps me add more coherent and interesting details. How to host a dungeon doesn't look bad, thoug perhaps what I'm looking for is more like what Morrius posted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442837/#Comment_442837" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T23:51:24+00:00" title="February 13, 2015 11:51PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great!

I hadn't tested it in this fashion so it looked like a good idea. Instead of making characters I just let players choose among 4 classes (fighter, cleric, rogue and wizard) and just roll the dice whenever they wanted to try anything. Things I limited: the amount of cure wounds spells the cleric had was limited to a 1d4 per rest. Also, PCs had only 6hp (each one was represented by a d6 on the table, in marching order)<br/><br/>We were just testing the tool so the dungeon had no specific goal or theme. But then it all started working better than if I had prepared a dungeon. I still have to adjust the tool since I could only use once a "sitting bench" as a trigger for a trap before it became one of the most obvious triggers. The whole effect was somewhat old-school, quite open for players to try things and with just enough details to feed their paranoia.<br/><br/>One of the best things was that though every room had a trap getting through them was more of a teamwork effort instead of just a chance for the rogue to shine. Whenever a trap made no sense as a mechanical construct, I switched it's nature into a magical one. Yet the trigger was always a different thing that could be avoided/deactivated with some careful observation and/or thinking outside the box. The trap itself could be treated this way too, so it didn't matter much if you were the fighter or the cleric, you could also give it a try at your own method of passing through traps.<br/><br/>I think that all that it's missing is a few mechanics like the ones Jason Lutes included in his game aids "Perilous Journeys", like choosing a theme and builder for the dungeon, set three things related to those and mark them off your list when players have grone through that description. Also, making time and/or light sources a limited resource would do wonders. I'll try to put some of this together in english to make it playable.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442950/#Comment_442950" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T22:11:43+00:00" title="February 16, 2015 10:11PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote up a document about "dungeon themes" (for improvisation) at some point years ago, but I think it's been taken down since then.

You can have as many rooms, corridors, stairs, etc to connect and present those features as you want as long as they don't present a challenge. If there's more than one room/corridor/stair to connect one feature with the next, narrate how players navigate through them without problems until they reach the next<br/><br/>Choose one builder, one function and two or three themes (decay, last stand, corruption, madness, etc) and use them to describe each room and challenge.<br/><br/>Level up by killing adventurers (one level per each death, keep their stuff as loot) or by having them take your valuables (1d6 levels)<br/><br/>How about dragons?
