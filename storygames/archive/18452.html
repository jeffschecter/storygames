At least, in this thread, I do!<br/><br/>In this thread, post either<br/>1. Two sentences or less of Actual Play that sum up something awesome. No context needed, just a "Tracy was here" and mic drop piece of awesome.<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>2. Post bite-sized (three or less paragraphs) actual play. Don't throw up random elements that have no context, engage us (aka me). Talk about how the game affected your play, how the scene made you feel or think about the story or the game itself.<br/><br/>If this experiment fails, if everyone would rather post AP like the previous months, that's cool with me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ejnro" title="ejnro"><img alt="ejnro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/046/n1IK1HCS13JEC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ejnro">ejnro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415435/#Comment_415435" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T09:44:06+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  9:44AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probably breaking the rules now.<br/><br/>Played my first live game of Fiasco last sunday, with three other players that haven't read the rules and haven't played this type of games before (haven't even watched the TableTop episode on Fiasco). Although they thought we were going to play some kind of boardgame, they threw themselves right into it and played out their characters. They even had a lot of fun.<br/><br/>We played the Ice, making a story involving a gay ex-couple, where one worked for a oil-drilling operation and the other was an eco-terrorist, the dead body of one of those, financial fraud, the arrival of the US president by plane, stealing of airplane fuel and knife stabbing. No radioactive penguins though.<br/><br/>Have been thinking of what could be done better and how. I think we ran into many of the common newbie mistakes: scenes dragging on (we got better at this, think people understood better what the point of scenes was. Act 2 took probably less than half the time of Act 1), not being clear enough about how relationships should be understood, and that the point of the game is actually to pull in different directions (one character seemed to lack an independent agenda for parts of the game. This player was stuck with two symmetrical relationships, which may have influenced this). Also being thinking about social dynamics, active vs quiet players and similar. Interesting is that for the first round all players except me chose to resolve. Next time I introduce the game to a new group I will maybe wait with introducing the player-resolve mechanic until second act or until all players have established at least one scene for themselves as it forces them to establish what their character wants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415460/#Comment_415460" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T12:14:14+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 12:14PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my play-by-forum AW game, Lost the Hocus rolled a 12 on opening her brain while talking to a group of NPCs. I gave her a glimpse into each of their souls. I'm sharing it because it was a pivotal moment in the game and the players were really jazzed by it.<br/>-------------------<br/>Everyone seems frozen in clay, statues where once stood your friends. The colors of their faces muted to a ruddy brown, but their eyes shine like gleaming jewels in the colors that you know them in life. They slide along the floor like chess pieces from where they stood moments ago and face you in semicircle. In turn, each speak unto you.<br/><br/>- Haribo's emerald eyes flash. He says in a hollow tone, <i>"Lost, my desire for you is my strength, but if the fire is ever allowed to spread, it will consume us both. You must deny my love without denying me. If you let me love you fully, I will smother you. If you deny me outright, my jealousy will destroy all that you love."</i><br/><br/>- Ricosta's eyes are blue here, her sapphires gleam as she says, <i>"In the aether, Lost, I am your true love. In the world of the flesh, I am forever broken, shattered beyond repair. I am yours until death. I will die before you, but I will always be here for you."</i><br/><br/>- Father Enders's agate eyes glimmer as he speaks with a clear and distinct voice, <i>"Lost, my child. I am a traitor, here to spy upon you for the order that I say I serve. You may kill me. You may win me to your cause. Only you can decide my fate. My heart is open, but my mind is closed. Logic blinds me to faith, scripture taints my soul. Free me."</i><br/><br/>- Chiclet's moonstone eyes glow dully. She intones with a weary voice, <i>"I am dead, Lost. I sought death, but did not know it. Now death haunts me and I only wish to leave a legacy. I am desperate to be worth remembering.

Ji thought he was in love with me, but I had no idea what was going on. So Ji got my father's approval and came to marry me. Rui confessed what she'd done, but made me promise not to tell Ji. So I had to pretend that I had written love letters to Ji, but I told Ji that I wouldn't marry him because..."</b> I glance up at Dash, sort of serious and shy. <b>"Because I was in love with you. But Ji was so upset at himself for ruining what he thought we had, so earlier today, I broke my promise to Rui and told Ji about the letters. Which is why Rui was so angry with me..." </b><br/><br/>I trail off, studying his face. That all came out in a jumbled mess, and I probably just completely overwhelmed him.

It went well!<br/>My dude (Medical) needed Weapons to destroy an inbound meteor storm.  According to the game mechanics, before we start play he's already decided which of his solutions will work and which ones won't.  But I don't know.  Rather than just saying "lemme get on that" and signing off for a while, he totally threw it back in my face.  "Why would that work?  How is that supposed to help your problem?"<br/><br/>I just had this assumption that he would help, and he broke through that and really displayed some dissent right in the moment.  It made me want to up my game too.  I couldn't comment on it mid-stream, because ViewScream doesn't allow for people to break character.  So later, when the solution failed, he was really great at spinning it like it wasn't his fault.<br/><br/>I had another attempt, and I was going to ask him again, but he caught me off-guard again, and redirected the conversation to the mysterious hull-eating bacteria, and how he had been "communicating with it" and how it was "here to save us."  And what I love about this game is there's no way I could have anticipated that, and yet it still totally fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416129/#Comment_416129" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T20:49:22+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  8:49PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three of us played our fourth session of Hero Wars tonight. Last time, Cabrakan, the Humakti death-knight, was lost with his warband on the Grasslands; he prayed to his god for guidance. The god responded by totally severing His connection to the knight and ceasing further contact. Cab's player elected for this result - when he rolled a total failure trying to invoke the death-god's Honor rune, I rolled a total success representing his warband's fear and discord. I told the player he could spend Hero Points to lessen the severity of the result, but he said, "I'm more interested in him losing his powers than keeping them." <br/>So we went with that. As a first-time Hero Wars GM, I really liked how Hero Pts. give the players the chance to make any moment the hill they die on. When Cigua used a summoning circle to tame a powerful house-spirit, the player rolled poorly, but then immediately decided she would use two Hero Points to bump the result up to a moderate victory. That made it super-clear she wanted Cigua the Shaman to be good at shaman-type things; by contrast, Cabrakan has hardly picked up his sword at all, and I don't think we've had any fights yet (except between Cigua and enemy spirits). I haven't tried running an Extended Contest yet; sometimes I feel like I should be calling for more dice rolls, but that might just be 'cause I've mostly been running AW and DW of late. <br/><br/>I keep a copy of Apocalypse World on the table while we play, just to have the MC Moves handy. They always help me out of a jam, which I need sometimes because I don't really get how I'm supposed to run Hero Wars (still working on the Narrator's Book). We're definitely having a lot of fun, and I'm getting the hang of the rules the players need to know.

It worked very well! A lot of really creepy and weird scenes. I enjoyed being possessed by the dead spirit who was trapped in the box the CEO always carried around with him, finding out that I was the father of another employee and freaking her out. Also, a great end scene where the ghost hunters were up in some strange attic to seal a spooky gate: they passed out, and when they woke up they were greeted by strange apparitions into some alien dimension. We played the game out physically, as per the game's instructions, so it was like a micro larp we made up on the spot.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
