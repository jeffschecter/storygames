                    Let me preface this by saying: <br/>
(1) I am currently playing/running a successful PTA game every two weeks with the gaming group I have access to.  (A) Next Generation of (DC-based) Super Heroes making a name for themselves in the Chicago of tomorrow.<br/>
(1a) I am running a weekly home-brew game for five-year-old.  A young speedster (with monster catching powers) exploring the virtual world (highly inspired by your favorite [X]-mon series.<br/>
(2) With same group (or close enough), I have attempted to run d20 (also Donjun) and really had it crash and fail.<br/>
<br/>
I was thumbing through the World of Warcraft RPG monsters book recently and got a real hankering to run something either in the WoW world or something highly inspired by it.  Lots of cool humanoid species with actual cultures attached to them doing heroic, even epic stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I largely need to be talked out of thinking about running another game. I am out of resources (both players and time).  And if, heaven forbid, I am convinced to run a game, I need to be talked out of D20.  I *want* to like D20, but it requires too much time - too much prep time (as much as I love tweaking critters) and too much time spent in combat. <br/>
<br/>
I *love* the collaborative aspects of PTA - so much so that our PTA game rotates the producer by scene.  We talk through the basic episode before play and the basic scenes before each and then just role-play - we often forget to actually roll conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enough rambling.  Thanks in advance for your thoughts.                </div>

                            Sounds to me like you should try FFRP.  Hand the book around the room, guage the interest, and do it.<br/>
<br/>
If you find that you need a 'system' after that, then you might want to try something like Heroquest or Nine Worlds.                        </div>

                            Hi Blue.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you're really stretched for time right now.  I have a lot of games I'd like to run too, but at some point there's just no opportunity.  So you have to restrict yourself to the best, deepest ideas that appeal to the players you've got.  <br/>
<br/>
It also sounds like the players you're gaming with aren't really into the hack &amp; slash style of fantasy games.  So, between the time stuff and the group stuff, it's going to be tricky.<br/>
<br/>
I'd recommend writing fiction, or finding another creative outlet that allows a tighter turn-around time between creative impulse and finished product--otherwise those ideas will keep building up, and it will get frustrating.  <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, it might be good to put the books down and do something else that's fun.  I found that doing martial arts was good exercise, kept me focused on what was important to me, and enabled me to see a different set of friends.                        </div>

                            Oh - I'd recommend using the Shadow of Yesterday, which is available free on-line, if you want to do the fantasy thing.  There's a lot of appreciation there for cultures, and the game doesn't bog down into combat.<br/>
<br/>
Adapting it to a given setting, however, might take some time and forethought, so I'd only do it if I knew for certain that the players were interested in playing it.                        </div>

                            My husband supports me in saying that worldbuilding is GM masturbation (and that making characters for games not being run is the player version.)  Which suggests to some that it should be done alone and in the dark, kind of like writing poetry.  [clears throat while looking amusedly sheepish]   I design all sorts of things when I have a hankering to run them, but I don't have a current group outside my family (which is large, but fairly intellectually homogenous.)  That's my recommendation: if you build something you like, maybe you can find the time, but if you don't have the resources for building it up in advance, you certainly don't have the time.

Ahh, yes, the gaming addiction problem.<br/>
<br/>
Must. Play. More. Games.<br/>
<br/>
Man, some days I feel we need Gamers Anonymous...<br/>
<br/>
Hi, I'm JoÃƒÂ£o and I'm a game-a-holic. It's been six weeks since I tried to start an RPG group...<br/>
<br/>
Blue, James's first post contains words of wisdom. Heed them! :)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
