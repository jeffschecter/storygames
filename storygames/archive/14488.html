We basically played our own lives.<br/><br/>So everyone at the table is a survivor of a terrible, terrible organization. We all worked there at one time or another, and the last of us got out only a few weeks ago. The place was and is monumentally fucked up, built out of condensed bricks of the purest fail. Naturally Steve built a playset, called Business Casual, that incorporates the culture and some choice elements of this organization. So we playtested it.<br/><br/>Four of the characters that emerged from the relationships were clearly people we knew. Everyone could easily recognize them, although we changed the names. They were easy to play. I suppose we heightened them a little for comic effect, but not very much. It felt strange! One of my friends kept saying "This is uncomfortable."<br/><br/>And the session felt cathartic - removed from reality, we were free to play these people into extreme corners and see what happened. What happened was sort of predictable - the Tilts were "Mayhem: Out of control rampage" and "Innocence: Collateral damage". Best of all, the truly terrible caricatures of truly terrible real life people had very appropriate endings - the CFO, easily one of the worst people I have ever met, ended up with white-9 and got a pay raise after destroying the business, just like in real life. We laughed and laughed, but it was a bitter laughter.<br/><br/>Outside of the weird psychodrama vibe, my favorite bit involved the only character not pulled from real life. Greg's guy ended up being an ambitiously clueless junior executive obsessed with six sigma quality control, who happened to be a Bosnian immigrant. He asked us to Establish a scene for him late in the game. Scott, as the evil CFO, set up a meeting and tapped me to play a new consultant.<br/><br/>CFO: Mr. Kova\u010d, this is Mr. Basara.<br/><br/>KOVAC: Pleased to meet you.<br/><br/>CFO: I was excited to discover that we could hire Mr. Basara, since you two are<i> from the same culture.</i> Mr. Basara is also from Yugoslavia!<br/><br/>KOVAC: Uh...<br/><br/>CFO: He's Serbian, so I know you'll get along.<br/><br/>BASARA (Smiling, In Serbo-Croatian): I hope I murdered your entire family.<br/><br/>CFO: Excellent! Off to a great start, guys. So happy to have a diverse workplace!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334745/#Comment_334745" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T22:42:47+00:00" title="July 15, 2011 10:42PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy fuck.
