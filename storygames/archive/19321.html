So far, Michtim only offers (kinda) physical Core Actions for the Attributes Joy, Love, Grief, Fear and Anger. But ever since I've dug into *W games, and reading helpful hints on the forum, I thought I really should create a better foundation for players to use. I'm not exactly sure if I want to follow the design language of the Moves (like it can't be rolled if it's not a Move), but the game probably would benefit from more non-violent/non-combat Actions.<br/><br/>The current Actions\u2026<br/><br/>Joy: Dash (Jump and Sprint), Detect<br/>Love: Cure Others<br/>Grief: Weep (=Curl into a ball to defend yourself)<br/>Fear: Hide, Evade (= Dodge)<br/>Anger: Attack<br/><br/>All very combat centric, which I thought would be required for an adventure game. On the other hand, I deliberately left Intelligence-like things out of the game so far. BUT, given *W's way of handling things, this might not be a problem. "Ask the MC questions" sort of things.<br/><br/>The Core Actions are greatly enhanced by Callings. Some Callings offer new Actions, others change the parameters of existing Actions. Every Calling benefits every Emotion though; so there are no preferred Emotions. Each Emotion should be valuable. <br/><br/>Some Social Actions are built into the Courtier and Bard Callings. But I'm willing to change a few things, so that there is room for new Core Actions.<br/><br/>Some possible Actions I'm looking for:<br/><br/>Joy: Find Opportunity (look for chances/options)<br/>Love: Offer Help (=be friendly, make yourself valuable, like a non-sexy turn-someone-on)<br/>Grief: Hear the Unspoken (~Gaze into Abyss, Sense Motive)<br/>Fear: Make an Escape<br/>Anger: Get Your Way (=be unfriendly, intimidating, forceful)<br/><br/>The core resolution mechanic is take a pool of Emotion d6. Set aside as many dice as you like to increase effect (hits). Roll. Try to beat 7. Players need to judge their chances and risk setting aside dice for hits. I think about a hold-based design pattern. You get 1 hold for every hit and pick options from a provided list.<br/><br/>So far I didn't have a way to include Hard Moves. If you failed a roll there weren't any strings attached. I think the game might really benefit from consequences, and a clear rule about "to do it, do it." I always thought that was obvious, but it probably requires explicit wording in the rules.<br/><br/>Your thoughts?<br/><br/>PS: To gain a better understanding of the core mechanics of my game, you can just head over to <a href="http://bit.ly/myFluffyRPG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/myFluffyRPG</a> and fetch it for free. The game has currently a lot of issues with railroading and no clear thoughts about how to handle player agency\u2026\xa0so please don't be harsh. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Honesty is welcome though.<br/><br/>PPS: The link won't be active forever.

Also bear with me: I've borrowed the String wording/mechanic from Avery so far, but that doesn't mean it will stick that way. It's just easier to communicate the idea this way.<br/><br/>Players buy individual options with hits. So if I have two hits on Find Opportunity, I may only pick two of the options. So maybe I find a valuable opportunity that will reap instant rewards, but I still require STUFF/PEOPLE to actually do it. The difference between immediately and unprepared is: preparation is about things, immediately is about time.<br/><br/>Or I could use Offer Help to try my hand at diplomacy. I offer a String on myself and want to gain a String on the other person as well\u2026<br/><br/>Open Up is a bit of a mess currently. It is supposed to play the "victim" card. Sometimes people will play the role of a victim as a tactic.

BUT, ever since I came here and learned about the movement, I think my game should offer an interface to accommodate that style of play.<br/><br/>So I was thinking about producing a new character sheet and a short (free) guide to accompany the game. I already have written a bit for my honobono experiment, but I do think this route will be more fruitful now. So yeah, it should introduce a new play style.<br/><br/>Also I do see the sense in not being generic. Maybe I'm not really sure about my aesthetic. I need to re-evaluate this as well. The game should be about being Small but Heroic. Fluffy but Serious. Powerful but with Responsibility. It should be a bit like a cartoon show, like Ewoks for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430325/#Comment_430325" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T08:31:36+00:00" title="March 31, 2014  8:31AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure about Find Opportunity, I'd prefer to relate Joy to Discovery and Learning, and maybe add Remembering to all emotions equally, if you ever ask for rolls to remember details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430330/#Comment_430330" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T10:26:05+00:00" title="March 31, 2014 10:26AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about "Open a Door" for Joy?

In the original rules it covers fast movement and perception, although the computer game variant of the rules had perceptions for every attribute. Joy was Detect Opportunity (power ups, treasures, shortcuts), where Fear was Detect Hiding Place (and also showed which direction enemies were looking). Love Perception was about health and Anger was combat centric (seeing weaknesses etc). The current Mood dictated the interface and your play style dictated your Mood.<br/><br/>Just you have some context.<br/><br/>From the neuroscience point of view it makes sense to link Joy to learning (Flow, dopamine emission etc), but the game isn't exactly about simulating learning, because most knowledge/intelligence aspects were deliberately left out of the rules. There's no intelligence trait because I didn't want to simulate that kind of situation.<br/><br/>Discovery is the big issue here.

It might also be understood to work that way. It really is in the wording, isn't it?<br/><br/>I've been having some trouble with this now. I can do this at least in two different ways:<br/><br/>1) Try to introduce these mechanics in my existing game, so Callings and my game theory still work.<br/>2) Throw everything away and go for a "Michtim World" hack.<br/><br/>The problem is: my game features Callings for every role (as in Anger-characters [fighters], Joy-characters [scouts]\u2026). So you can have a Joy-Sorcerer, an Anger-Sorcerer etc\u2026\xa0and the combination of Callings is also something that I really liked about Vanilla. <br/><br/>My fear is that Callings won't be useful with the new Actions. This is pretty important to me though. I'm in a pinch.<br/><br/>If I go for the AW-hack, I'd need to say goodbye to generic Callings and embrace a completely different set of roles. <br/><br/>I do think I have a good grasp of how the probabilities of Moves in AW work. Michtim is completely different, because it allows users to minimize the chance of failure (but at the expense of hits). I'm not entirely sure my way of doing things will be dramatic in the end.<br/><br/>Players could just roll 3d6, which generally is higher than 7 (10.5) and will very probably yield a success. In AW a perfect hit on 2d6 requires a 10, which is really tough without high traits. Even with +2, you still need to roll higher than the mean (7).<br/><br/>Combined with the fact that AW has Hard Moves / consequences on failed rolls, this makes for dramatic rolls. I feel that my game isn't always clear about these kind of consequences. Sure, you will be hit if you fail to Evade. You will be found if you fail to Hide\u2026\xa0but it isn't as structured as AW.<br/><br/>Also, one question: How do you handle a character that tries to accomplish something acrobatic? If it isn't a Move, it can't be done?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430375/#Comment_430375" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T05:25:00+00:00" title="April  1, 2014  5:25AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is my house rule for when a player who wants to do something iffy that's not an actual Move:<br/><br/>If there are no real consequences for failure, just let them do it.  Maybe it takes some time, however.<br/><br/>If there are only minor consequences for failure (hurt your neck, etc), let them make a custom move roll based on the appropriate Stat.  Failure in this case will not bring about a Hard Move from me, just a Soft one ("You fall and pull a neck muscle for zero damage; if you fail that again you may be seriously hurt.")

No jumping to the moon (unless you are a Lovecraftian cat).<br/><br/>Yeah these are basically Attribute Rolls, treated as (custom) Basic Moves.  It's a throwback to my old D&amp;D days too, but it's still often used and appreciated even in AW.  We can't expect Vincent to write every possible action that can be performed by a physical body.  The tendency of the rules is to just let these things happen, and in general I do that, but sometimes success or failure in these things can be pivotal to the emerging storyline.  So in those cases I follow a different principle: <i>Sometimes, disclaim decision-making</i>.<br/><br/> ... but this question has changed: <b><i>When? </i></b><br/><br/>In the old days it was a question of "Is there a chance the character might fail according to the laws of physics?" and if so, we'd roll it out (whether it was dramatically important or not).<br/><br/>Today it's more like "Is there a chance that success or failure will affect the story in a dramatic way?"<br/><br/>I can't answer your question about whether other people feel comfortable with "Attribute Rolls" or not.  It probably depends on their previous experience.  For me as a GM, I find them invaluable.  That's why I argue for Stats in "DayTrippers", for instance.  There are just too many possibilities not to give the GM a good fallback for.<br/><br/>Of course, if you want to persuade players and GMs to do this more frequently in <i>your</i> game, you should explicitly state it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430378/#Comment_430378" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T06:21:02+00:00" title="April  1, 2014  6:21AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far, I always thought that certain actions needed to be scripted. I abstained from scripting social and mental actions, because I wanted the Michtim characters to be like vehicles. Steered by the players social and mental capabilities. Deliberately leaving these aspects out of the game (where possible) was my try at creating a reasonable system that doesn't punish playing a character that you cannot portray. <br/><br/>We had this issue a lot with social interaction in our games. Players that were good at social interaction got away without rolling; those with the stats were always forced to "please roleplay what you do" and often failed because their "social performance" wasn't deemed to be "good enough", although the dice might have said something else. <br/><br/>The same with mental actions. Like my player character was a private investigator with high investigation + intelligence + wits. He is supposed to know where to look. But the GM always asked me *specifically* where my character looked. I tried to explain that I might not be a good PI, but my character is.<br/><br/>This sort of discrepancy made me furious. <br/><br/>Anyway, I guess this is a bit OT right now.<br/><br/>Simply put: I wasn't aware that it was okay to roll stats in AW as an improvisation. Of course it makes sense, but I somehow thought it was against the focus of the game.

Of course it's all about the story.  As a GM you are a slave to the story, right?  And in most games, the story is about heroes, not a bunch of fuckups.  But you are a <i>crafty</i> slave, and you know your master likes a good dramatic conflict before beating you soundly.<br/><br/>2. If a person hesitates to roleplay sometimes I just ask them "Do you want to roll it or say it?"  This gives the introverted people a way out of their dilemma and encourages everyone to look at their stats.  Of course everyone has already been told that a failed roll results in a move from the MC (or in D&amp;D, the possibility of a crit fail), so there's a risk.  Sometimes the extraverts will start asking for dice rolls too - <i>but only when their odds are good.</i>  Which is fine, that's the fiction of the character asserting itself.  If they don't verbalize it, I will, and I'll let them "correct" me as I go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430405/#Comment_430405" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T01:28:55+00:00" title="April  2, 2014  1:28AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2014 2:23AM by zydake.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried to write my current new Actions up\u2026 what do you think?<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/><b>Claw and Bite (Anger)</b><br/>On a hit you inflict 1 wound.

Allow the Cybertooth to Spend a X Marker to intervene using X? Like an interrupt?
