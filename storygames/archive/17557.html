I just need to write it down. It's a fast paced pulp action game that takes place in an alternative 1930, where Americans seek adventures in foreign continents. One important thing in the game is that the "GM" and the players collaborate when they play. The players and the GM creates a P.R.E.P. which consist of things that will occur in the adventure and then the GM creates scenes where the players encounter the things made up in the P.R.E.P. The thing is that it's important that the players don't think it's the players against the GM. They should all collaborate and spin off from each others descriptions. Therefore I don't want to use "game master", because that can add to the feeling "we against the GM".<br/><br/>1. So what should I call the GM in my pulp game where the GM is the one who a) explains the rules and b) creates troubles for the characters? I considered "troublemaker" at first, but that word can bring the same feeling as "game master". I want to give the impression that the GM and the players are at the same level. My thoughts have been around making up a word that means something like "the one who is feeding the fire with wood", but can't find a word for it. I would prefer something short and catchy. Anyone with a suggestion? It doesn't have to be about the fire but it should in some sense tell the reader about the GM's duty in this game.<br/><br/>2. I don't want to launch my game as a roleplaying game, because if I do, then I have to fight against roleplaying gamer's assumptions of what a roleplaying game should be like. I did that with another game and I learned my lesson. I also want to reach out to non-gamers with my game, and "roleplaying games" is usually meaning "World of Warcraft" or something similar to them. Like I said, I don't want to fight assumptions. It's a game that you can bring out one evening, start playing directly, and it will take at most 1,5 hours to play. I want the game experience to be something social, like playing cards together, except that you share an adventure together in a fictive world. So any ideas of what I should call this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398150/#Comment_398150" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T22:51:45+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 10:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone who feeds a fire is a stoker, though honestly, "troublemaker" doesn't carry much of the "GM" implications to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398151/#Comment_398151" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T23:01:15+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 11:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Troublemaker is pretty great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398155/#Comment_398155" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T23:48:19+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 11:48PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

I recognize "world-player" from a game, and thought it sounded a little stiff when I read it then. Not that I throw away the idea, I just have to find any better name for it.<br/><br/>I also liked "inciter" and "kick-starter" (I have a kicker-table) while "facilitator" made me ponder if I could use "promoter".<br/><br/>Using movie jargon fits perfectly in my game, because I usually introduce the P.R.E.P. with "Imagine you're flicking through the channels on the TV, and an adventure movie is showing. We're now going to create the elements in that movie".<br/><br/>"A Game of Pulp Storytelling" would be an excellent subtitle to the name of the game as well as explaining what the game is about. The only downside is that "pulp" is mentioned twice in that case, so I would probably change it to: This Is Pulp: A Game of Adventurous Storytelling. By doing that, I can probably call it "a game" in my game texts.<br/><br/>So my question no2 is answered, and I got some words to choose from when it comes to my first question. Thanks!<br/><br/>If anyone got any more suggestions or wants to give weight to any of the already given ones, I will take that under consideration. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398177/#Comment_398177" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T06:17:18+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  6:17AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of jumping onto the AW bandwagon (not necessarily a bad thing), Master of Ceremonies or MC is actually a pretty good term.

No offence Rickard, you're trying to provide a new perspective and add an element of creativity, and I salute you for that, but there's been a definite trend in recent years to call the GM something else, whether Storyteller, Watchtower or whatever.

What you say is interesting, because there was a thread on UKRoleplayers recently about what to include in RPG books. One user commented that it was annoying when game designers referred to a well-known mechanic by another name (Downers instead of Hit Points, say- poor example but you know what I mean), either well-meaningly or just to be different. That's a worse crime IMO than coming up with a different name for the GM.

The word "master" may also imply that that player is more important*. My game is all about planting thoughts into the reader's mind and the game is about collaborate storytelling where one player has a different role. I had other players GM my game for me, and it usually ended in "me against the players". So I really want to minimize any kind of element in an early state that may give that notion, no matter how small they are.<br/><br/>So it's not really the role of that player that it's unique, it's more about all the parts of the game striving for the same thought - collaborate storytelling where all the players are equally important.<br/><br/>* That's why "director" may be a bad term. I want something more like the banker in Monopoly. No one thinks of that player as more important, just that it's a person with more obligations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398250/#Comment_398250" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T16:48:52+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  4:48PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is, perhaps I don't even need a name for the GM.

An interesting aspect of this phenomenon is that when we reach the point you refer to, often such formations can have another element added which is the full form of one of the existing components without anyone (apart from me) raising an eyebrow. Examples include PIN number and, in the UK, TUC Congress. Years ago I compiled a list of such, but can only think of those two now.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398284/#Comment_398284" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T04:16:57+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  4:16AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the idea of not calling out the role as special at all.

Instead of settling on one term, use all of them where and when they are appropriate. Hell, use inappropriate capitalization or bold print as necessary to get the idea across. Let the people reading the text decide for themselves whether you intend the terms to be official terms or are simply using the emphasized words to catch their attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398297/#Comment_398297" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T06:24:26+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  6:24AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a growing trend in instructional text to direct it at the reader with the assumption that it is also the facilitator - a fair assumption.

My standpoint for making this game is that there should be just a tiny takeoff before you can fly. To be able to do this, I've been looking towards how boardgames can manage with a very short manuals (as compared to RPG standards). I stole a lot of design ideas, but one thing I will try to do is exactly what you're writing. Another thing that bugs me in RPGs is that they usually explain how to resolve things, instead of telling how to play the game. It may sound the same, but it's actually a huge difference.<br/><br/>I will talk about how I will structure my text in another thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I know what I need to have in my game.

The book itself was a little advice and a whole lot of mechanics. It really didn't tell me how to play one of these wonderful, giant, multiplayer games that the author was known for putting on at conventions.<br/><br/>I went to the related yahoo group and started posting, asking what probably seemed like some very stupid newbie questions. It took a while, but eventually I got some answers that clarified exactly what sorts of things were going on in these games.<br/><br/>As it turned out, it only had a minimal interaction with the rulebook. That stuff I'd paid money for was deeply secondary to the important answers I was getting from the forum responses.<br/><br/>I can't really blame the author though. He was selling the part his audience expected to buy, even though it wasn't actually the important part for someone like me.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398305/#Comment_398305" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T07:11:23+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  7:11AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Rickard: Don't let anybody give you shit about having a game, but not having it written up yet.</blockquote>\nHaha. I don't mind. It's actually how I design games nowadays. For my first roleplaying game, I wrote everything down, playtested it and rewrote the text. It took me more than 300 (re)written pages to get a game consisting of 112 pages. Such a waste of time! So when I got into my next project, I playtested everything, built out the game as I continued. When I finally wrote it down, it took me two weeks to produce fifty pages that were both proofread and put in a descent layout.<br/><br/>So for This Is Pulp, I started out with four tables and twelve descriptions of archetypes. After ten playtests, I did a character sheet. Now, after more than twenty playtests with all kinds of people, the game is finished. I know what I should put in my game, because of my research (the playtests). I just have to play around with how I should write it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
