Later, she is nearly arrested in her own home but instead miraculously bolts along with the evidence of all her contraband book dealings. Meanwhile, the trader of nude portraits has an awkward absinthe party where he meets a like-minded hedonist, actually an Inspector-in-disguise. The trader then tried to sell a nude painting of Abigail to the governor, only to be busted by the traitor hedonist. Fortunately, he throws the painting through the governor's window in order to save it. The trader then is broken of his will to party through drugs and electro-shock therapy added to several staged social scenarios. The widow gets caught sending a letter off to the colonies, and she painfully sacrifices the letter in exchange for her continued well-being. Finally, the governor contemplates a seriously subversive painting of Abigail in his study, only to be snooped out by his gardener's wife.<br/><br/><b>Mechanics Summary:</b><br/><br/>I was the game facilitator (meaning I played neither Criminal nor Law, but merely made the game run smoothly). I admit that I clung to the <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Perfect-Resources1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Brief Overview sheet</a> like a steering wheel. Anything not well-articulated on that sheet was more or less shoved to the side, including the bit about putting out glass beads and such. Overall, I loved the amount of consistent pressure applied on the characters, regardless of the scale of their crime. They could steal some grapes, admire a portrait, or commit genocide, and the Inspectors would still react similarly. The only critique I had from our short playthrough was one I would make of <i>Shock</i> or <i>Annalise</i> too, which was that the Criminals had little opportunity to interact among themselves, so the really interesting bits of fiction were the common threads that ran through parallel stories: the overall politeness of the Inspectors, the nervousness of the population, the accessibility of rooftops, and so forth. This led to pleasurable "literary" interpretations of the material, but otherwise actual mediocre role-playing from the players.<br/><br/>A great experience overall, and alas - too short!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375441/#Comment_375441" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T08:38:46+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:38AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more question:<br/><br/>Joe, do you even care about this game anymore?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375447/#Comment_375447" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T08:56:18+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:56AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Evan Torner</cite>Joe, do you even care about this game anymore?</blockquote>\nYep!

Like Shock:, the game is rather isolationist in design.<br/><br/>I find that two things that are important to balancing that out are: keep to the scene length guidelines (which will ensure that people rotate into the spotlight quickly), and to jump in and play NPCs and Contacts in one another's scenes (which increases interaction and "actual roleplaying").<br/><br/>How often did people jump in and play NPCs?<br/><br/>How many crime cycles did everyone move through in the session?<br/>What scene options (Capture/Establish a Hold, Interrogation/Conditioning/Guilt) did people choose during the game?<br/><br/>Did you guys have fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375453/#Comment_375453" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T09:11:39+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  9:11AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 9:12AM by Evan_Torner.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the questions, Joe \u2013 I wanted to see if this was still something you wanted to discuss.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>keep to the scene length guidelines</blockquote>\nThese, by the way, were super helpful in keeping the players in line about a scene. But my issue lay with one player who would frame a sorta bland scene, and then take a <i>really</i> long time to think about things when myself (as non-playing facilitator) and/or the other PCs tried to screw with his world. I didn't want to rush the introvert, but I was also in a convention setting and saying to myself "Make a hard choice and go with it, dammit!"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>How often did people jump in and play NPCs?</blockquote>\nAs it turns out, everybody wanted to play their Inspectors as Law players, <i>even when their target Criminal was not in the scene.</i> They jumped into at least 2 or 3 scenes with these other characters. Otherwise, I had to assume or cast the roles of NPCs; a distribution of authority issue at our particular table, since I was the one facilitating but not really playing the game.  But the Inspector thing maybe a note for a future game possibility: something that scratches the itch of the players' inner regulatory fascist.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>How many crime cycles did everyone move through in the session?</blockquote>\n2 for 2 players, 1 for the 2 other players, with a possible Collaborative Crime that fell apart between one of the players who got 1 turn and one who got 2.<br/><br/>I think character creation lasted far too long with respect to my three hour slot, and it was largely due to simple logistics. I had only two copies of the rules at the table, and the players insisted that I read through the various options for the Archetypes, Certifications, etc., which just sucked down time like nobody's business.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>What scene options (Capture/Establish a Hold, Interrogation/Conditioning/Guilt) did people choose during the game?</blockquote>\nAbout 50/50 on the Capture/Establish a Hold. An admirable aspect of my group was that they really followed the prior fiction from the Crime scene to determine whether an offense was worth Capturing on the spot or about pursuing in terms of a greater crime. Drama mattered more than Tension Points.  We had one Retribution (Conditioning) scene and one Retribution (Interrogation) scene. The former succeeded, the latter failed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Did you guys have fun?</blockquote>\nYes, and everybody felt like they needed to be scrubbed of the dreary world of Cadence afterwards. I only wish that I had managed my time a little better to get in scenes with the last two players and had more efficiently introduced the world, the character creation process and the way in which the PCs could intervene in each others' fictions as NPCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375456/#Comment_375456" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T09:23:39+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  9:23AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 9:24AM by Jim_Crocker.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Evam, did the unexpected shift from a longer slot to the shorter 3-hour slot knock you for a loop like it did me?<br/><br/>I went in expecting a 4-hour slot and even after I started it was hard to adjust on the fly without feeling rushed and a little frustrated I didn't get everything in I wanted to.<br/><br/>Would a stack of pre-gens or partials have cut down on the analysis paralysis it sounds like you ran into with creation, or does the game really demand that everyone invest by making their own dude from scratch?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375462/#Comment_375462" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T09:48:18+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  9:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, the shorter 3-hour slot certainly caught me with my 4-hour-slot pants down.  But I tried my best to play catch-up with some intense play after that bear of a first hour (character creation).<br/><br/>Honestly for me, Marc Majcher's Game Poems were the best possible way to spend the 3-hour slot.  We got 4 of them in, and had a blast without any real commitments. Once you begin to elicit real player buy-in (i.e. making characters) and emotional commitment (i.e. seeing the unfolding narrative change them irrevocably), then you need TIME.<br/><br/>Yes, the next time I try to run a 3-hour demo of a game that has mature, complex themes, I'm making the pre-gens and partials mandatory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375463/#Comment_375463" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T09:49:43+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  9:49AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite><br/>Would a stack of pre-gens or partials have cut down on the analysis paralysis it sounds like you ran into with creation, or does the game really demand that everyone invest by making their own dude from scratch?</blockquote>\nI used to think that it was absolutely vital to have people create their own characters for this game - it's a game that demands a high degree of buy-in.<br/><br/>Now, I'm starting to feel like - for a one-shot - partially-generated characters are essential, in order to actually get to the game and fit 3 crime cycles into a 4-hour session (which is always my goal). Maybe a character that's already got: one archetype, their waistcoat &amp; freedoms, both certifications, and two aspects. The player would sit down and need to add only: a name, maybe another archetype, and one more aspect.<br/><br/>Alternately, I should produce a couple print-outs containing the summary information for each Archetype, Freedom, and Certification).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
