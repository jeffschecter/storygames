I dug myself out of work and now I think I have time to hash out my SotC cheat sheet. But I'm invoking/compelling the "bored Fate geniuses at Storygames with nothing better to do all afternoon" aspect on this board to help me out and make sure I don't fuck this up too bad.<br/><br/>The end result is to get this in some kind of graphical format, for which I will charge US$0. That's because I hate artists and like making them feel helpless.<br/><br/>Before I get into that I have some very quick rules questions:<br/><br/>Can you use Fate to Declare an Aspect onto another character, or does this always require a Maneuver? My gut sense is that the authorship economy of SotC comes down to everything costing either a Fate or a Maneuver, so I could see simply dropping a Fate if you have an Aspect that's written to apply to other characters. Example: Aspect is "Scary as Hell." Can I drop a Fate and declare that you now have the aspect "Scared out of my wits!"?<br/><br/>Is there a functional difference between invoking/compelling an Aspect "for effect" versus invoking/compelling an Aspect "to declare"? Example: Aspect is "First on the Scene!" Player wants to literally be first on the scene, so what's he doing? Is he invoking for effect or is he invoking to declare?<br/><br/>Now...SotC's RAW state that only the GM can directly compel an Aspect but that characters can "cause the GM to compel another character's Aspects, via tagging." I want to square this up with the example in the other thread about a PC compelling a mook's "beat up". Now, by the RAW that's not directly possible -- a player can't be the source of the bribe. So I'm thinking the player is asking the GM to simply <i>pay himself</i> for the compel. Is this correct?<br/><br/>I think that's it for now.<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112842/#Comment_112842" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T13:48:28+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  1:48PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I can tell, you have to Maneuver to create an Aspect, and you have to pay a fate point to make that Aspect non-fragile (i.e. "sticky").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112845/#Comment_112845" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T13:55:05+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  1:55PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>As far as I can tell, you have to Maneuver to create an Aspect, and you have to pay a fate point to make that Aspect non-fragile (i.e. "sticky").</blockquote>\nPage ref, for context?

However, under certain circumstances, I could see letting you just do it with a fate point and not roll - it'd depend on the target. If my NPC has the aspect "Timid Scientist" and you have "Scary as Hell" and you say, "I want to place 'Scared Shitless' on this guy, to make it easier to get info out of him," I'd probably let you spend a fate point and do it.<br/><br/>But if you want the "rules default", maneuvers/declarations place aspects on targets.

In other words, if I come into a town and say, "I know a member of the local Thieves Guild here, here's a fate point," I'm more liable to accept that if one of your aspects is "Thieves Guild Cutpurse" or "Well-Connected Criminal" or whatever.\n<blockquote>Now...SotC's RAW state that only the GM can directly compel an Aspect but that characters can "cause the GM to compel another character's Aspects, via tagging."</blockquote>\nFile that under, "We maybe spent too much effort trying not to scare the straights."<br/><br/>If you're going to tag another character's aspect for effect, that technically "goes through" the GM for authority purposes - you say, "The mook has 'beat up', and I think he's got no more stomach for this fight. Tag for effect?" As GM, I have two things to approve there - is this a valid compel, and am I going to take this compel?<br/><br/>But suppose you're tagging another PC for effect - "I'm trying to convince Jet to ditch the group and the careful approach. and come with me to Rocket Red's secret hangout to bust up her plans. Here's two fate points - you always have to be First on the Scene, and you have a Rivalry with Rocket Red. You totally come with me."

Brain...melting.... Well. The tag itself costs a Fate, which goes into the kitty ('away' -- nobody owns that point any more). The compelled character has the option of accepting a bribe from the GM, which doesn't cost anyone anything. The compelled character also has the option of buying off that compel, which also goes to the kitty -- and not the player doing the compel. A ha. That's the difference! So if you're directly bribing (version 1), then the buy-off is going back into the player's pocket. And that's the hiccup.<br/><br/>I agree that that's crazy talk.

If you don't trust the guy sitting next to you to use the system with the best of intentions, why are you playing an admittedly high-trust RPG with them?<br/><br/>Think about it in terms of the example I gave: Rocket Red's planning something foul, and Mack Silver wants to run off and go stop it, but Sally and the Grey Ghost want to wait it out and plan a little first, let her make the first move. Mack appeals to Jet Black and puts forward two fate points during the scene. Assume we're using version 1 from your post, and the GM's an authority stopover.<br/><br/>a.) By choosing to make this a compel instance instead of a social conflict, there's no going to dice here - it's all currency exchange to resolve the scene. Mack slides the two FPs forward, the GM gets no flak from Jet's player, and so calls it valid.<br/><br/>b.) If Jet takes the compel, he gets two fate points and Mack loses two, meaning that in the scene that follows where they bust up Rocket Red's bunker, Jet has a little bit more awesome to bring to bear. Mack gets what he wanted, but has to be more careful in the later conflict, maybe providing a comedic opportunity for him to go, "Geez, maybe Sally was right about this running headlong into danger thing" if stuff starts to go bad for him.<br/><br/>c.) If Jet doesn't take the compel, he loses two fate points and Mack gains two - Mack doesn't get what he wants, but when he runs off to Rocket Red's bunker by himself, he'll probably need those two fate points to help deal with her and all of her goons. Jet's played against type, but that means he's set up for a future scene where he takes a few compels himself to catch back up - he might go try and rescue the captured Mack Silver out of guilt, and then need Sally to come save him. He might get so restless that when Sally and the Ghost finally do decide to strike, he rushes ahead and gets in Over His Head, etc etc.<br/><br/>For my money, there's nothing crazy about how that movement of currency affects the flow of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112923/#Comment_112923" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T22:32:45+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 10:32PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2007 10:41PM by PaulB.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally agreed when you're talking about moving the currency around amongst PCs. But what about the PCs hitting up NPC Aspects? <br/><br/>NPC <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> has picked up "beat to hell" as, say, a moderate consequence in a fight.<br/><br/>PC <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> tags "beat to hell" and waves a Fate at the GM. "Are you sure you don't want your NPC to run away now that he's been beat to hell?"<br/><br/>So now the PC either compels the NPC to run away, <i>or</i> gains a Fate. Or two or three, if other players can escalate just like the GM.<br/><br/>Now...I like the decision point the player has to make: Can I afford to lose that Fate to get my way? What I don't like is that the player wins in all cases: either he gets what he wants or he gets 1-3 Fate back. There's no motivation in place to not compel every single time, other than the the limitations of your Fate pool. EDIT: The more I think about it, the more I see the limitations of the Fate pool as an important mitigating factor in all this. I need more actual play time to see the economy in action.<br/><br/>Something that's nagging at me: When a character's Aspect has been compelled, who has authority over how that Aspect will play out? Like...let's say PC1 tries to bribe the GM to compel NPC1's "beat to hell" aspect. Who decides what happens when it's compelled? Because if it's the player saying "because the NPC is beat to hell, I want him to run away," that's a lot more potent than, "I want your NPC to react to being beat to hell." Which brings up issues of just how much action you can squeeze out of a compel. Which, I totally get, is a trust issue.<br/><br/>Thanks for talking this out!

This might sound like a cop out, but I swear to you that it isn't. <br/><br/>I guess I really don't see the choice as being too different for a GM controlling an NPC as I do for a player. But, like I said in the other thread, I'm anal about how many fate points a named NPC has - they have their pool, and it increases and decreases through play like any other character. So, if Der Blitzmann's privileged henchman has spent all his fate points fighting you and has a consequence of "Beat to Hell", I have a built-in reason to take that compel if you offer it. The currency operation doesn't mysteriously vanish just because I'm the GM.<br/><br/>But, here's something that might change your perspective a bit:\n<blockquote>Something that's nagging at me: When a character's Aspect has been compelled, who has authority over how that Aspect will play out?</blockquote>\nDo you know how surreal it is to be able to quote yourself? "It's important to note that an aspect may dictate the type of action, but it usually shouldn't dictate the precise action, which is always the player\u2019s decision." Page 44.<br/><br/>Really, a compel is about highlighting drama through the limitation of choice. In the case of the "Beat to Hell" aspect, however you phrase it, what you're really saying is this: "Der Blitzmann's lieutenant is exhausted and knows he can't win. He doesn't have the will to keep fighting anymore." There are a lot of ways I could take that - I might call for reinforcements, and the scene ends with you dealing with some minions while I get away. I could surrender outright. I could blow myself up. The reason why there's a negotiation process involved there is so no one is forced to compromise their vision of the character.<br/><br/>That's why compels are ultimately pretty useless as a railroading tool - no one can tell you precisely what to do, really. The GM might state the compel in absolute terms, but you have wiggle room in there, so long as you accept that the proverbial gauntlet has been thrown. If you're at a party and your arch-nemesis spills a drink on you, the GM can say, "You're not going to take that lying down." He can't *really* say, "You punch his lights out, right there in the middle of everyone."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113053/#Comment_113053" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T17:09:03+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  5:09PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, new question (carried over from Jason's poor thread, which I'm trampled into a pulpy mess). (Get it? Pulpy!)<br/><br/>Fate-powered declarations vs. skill-powered declarations. I fear that the phrase "declaration" is used two different ways. When you use Fate, you can declare anything to be true (p.12-13), with the expectation that you're going to get away with more if it references one of your own Aspects. So, two questions:<br/><br/>Is spending a Fate to make a "this is true" declaration fundamentally the same as "invoking for effect"? IE I have the aspect "First on the Scene!", so I can spend a Fate and be ensured I'll be there first. If there's no difference between invoking for effect and spending a fate to make a declaration, does that mean you can <i>also</i> tag an outside Aspect to make a declaration?

I fear that the phrase "declaration" is used two different ways.</blockquote>\nNot really, but I can definitely see where the tightening up needs to occur there.<br/><br/>Let's look at page 83: "By contrast, knowledge skills will often allow <b>declaration</b> \u2013 in other words, using a knowledge skill successfully can allow a player to introduce entirely new facts into play, and then use those facts to his advantage. The new facts take the form of a temporary aspect."<br/><br/>Really, what that last sentence should say, if I were going to nitpick it, is "The new facts <i>can</i> take the form of a temporary aspect." I'd put that up next to spending fate points on a declaration, too.<br/><br/>The basic ability is being able to declare facts. You can spend a fate point to do that, or if you happen to have a relevant skill, you can roll the skill. Sometimes, this fact translates to something you can take mechanical advantage of in a situation, and hence should be represented by a temporary aspect that you get a free tag on.<br/><br/>So, let's do some examples:<br/><br/>You're breaking in to a facility. The GM says there are guards at the end of the hall. It's in the middle of the night, so you throw a fate point out and say, "They're asleep." The GM nods, and because you have to make a Stealth roll to get past them, the GM decides that they have "Asleep" as a temporary aspect you can tag for free. Note that for something like this, you'd need a fate point, because there aren't any skills you could roll to influence whether those characters are asleep or awake when you run across them.<br/><br/>You're breaking into a facility. Your character has the aspect "Ex-Military Commando", and you throw out a fate point and say, "Hey, they probably modeled this after a military installation, so I'd probably know shortcuts to get around in there." The GM nods, and now the facility has "Shortcuts" as a temporary aspect that you might be able to tag later.<br/><br/>You're breaking into a facility. The GM says that you come upon the powerplant for the facility, a weird-looking, compact reactor. You have Engineering, and you say, "Yeah, this looks like the same kind of tech I've seen on Doc Methuselah's weird gizmos. It has a weak point near the heat sinks where I can disrupt the flow of electricity and take out the lights and whatever else might be connected to it." The GM nods and has you roll your skill, and you succeed. Later, when you make your Engineering roll to dismantle it, you've got "Weak Point" that you can hit up for a free tag.<br/><br/>You're breaking into a facility. The GM says you discover a warehouse full of crates, and tells you that the room has an aspect  of "Cramped" or something like it. You say, "Hunh. I bet that there's some kind of central roster in here that catalogs all these - it'd be the only way they could keep track of it all," and you spend a fate point. The GM nods, and writes down "Roster" in his notes, so that when you're rummaging through drawers with Investigation later, you can tag that to find additional information.<br/><br/>All of the above moves are rules-legal. Not all groups will be comfortable with allowing all of them for various reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113108/#Comment_113108" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T09:26:19+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  9:26AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Is spending a Fate to make a "this is true" declaration fundamentally the same as "invoking for effect"?</blockquote>\nYes.  Except, when you're doing it without an aspect, the GM should not treat it to have the same weightiness as it does *with* an aspect.  When someone spends a FP to say "I have a flashlight", well, great, they have a flashlight.  When they spend a FP to say "I have a flashlight because I'm a Boy Scout: Always Prepared", that moment gains more importance -- it's highlighting a core truth about the character.  As the GM, there, I might then sit up and say, "Yeah, you really are.  You've got the flashlight, and probably more.  What *else* do you think you have because of this?"  I'm giving the declaration a fatter footprint in the second case because an aspect is involved, and that is -- in fact -- exactly what invoking for effect *is*.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>If there's no difference between invoking for effect and spending a fate to make a declaration, does that mean you can<i>also</i>tag an outside Aspect to make a declaration?</blockquote>\nYep.  "Tag" in many cases simply means "Invoke an aspect that isn't intrinsically yours."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Is it safe to assume that Fate-powerered Declarations do not have the same mechanical effect as skill-powered Declarations?</blockquote>\nYep.  I'm a little frustrated that this confusion made it into the rules, but it's entirely due to the rules being written by three guys instead of one, and each of us has a different level of (or lack of) Obsessive-Compuslive Disorder about precision in terminology.  From the non-OCD perspective, both are cases where you're declaring something to be true, it's just represented in the world in a different way, so hey, call both of those "declaration".  Me, I might be inclined to get very stressed and anal about that and say, no, the fate-powered stuff is "Declaring" (declare "this is true" as a binary operation), and the skill-powered stuff is "Asserting" (assert "this is true" is then something to be tested, so a skill gets rolled).  On the other hand, these are really just two entry-points on the same continuum.  Consider, a skill-powered Declaration can be done to introduce an aspect that reflects the declared reality.  Then, the free tag that exists on that aspect can be used to Declare (via Invoke/Tag For Effect) that something else is true -- or to get a reroll, +2, etc.  The fate based way is sort of a, "Hey, I want to mold the story with this truth"; the skill based way is "Hey, I want use this truth to set up an advantage for later use".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113130/#Comment_113130" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T12:46:48+00:00" title="December  9, 2007 12:46PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred, Lenny: Awesome, thanks for the feedback. I'm hearing slightly different answers from both of you, which is totally fine but I'm hoping I can keep hitting you both up for more clarifications.<br/><br/>Anal-retentive: Yeah. I try not to be -- honoring the spirit of the rules and all that -- but you know how players can be. I'm also trying to be as explicit in this cheat sheet business as I can be (I've done this for other games and the process is both enormously valuable for me, and has highlighted certain weaknesses/ambiguities that have slipped past playtest. I can't be the only guy out there doing this sort of thing.)<br/><br/>Back to the question at hand. Here's where I'm feeling the disconnect between declaring with an Aspect and declaring with a Skill: If I declare something with an Aspect, that means I'm using an Aspect to make an Aspect, and that doesn't seem to fit the underlying math. I see Aspects modifying (improving, sometimes changing) skills, and skills modifying (creating, destroying) Aspects. But using an Aspect to modify (create/destroy) an Aspect is, at least in my little pea brain, the same as using a Skill to modify (improve, sometimes change) a Skill. Which is in fact maybe possible! But I'm not locking into that yet.<br/><br/>Then there's this whole definition of what a "fact" is inside the game. I think certain narrative materials -- color -- have Aspects you can tag, while other materials are just there to provide continuity. The "here's a point, I have a flashlight" bit is just there to lubricate the scene. The "I'm using my Stealth skill to declare that there's a <i>things to stub your toe on</i> Aspect on this scene" bit is adding something mechanical. But, since as you say it's all a continuum, under what circumstances would the "here's a point, I'm a Boy Scout, and by golly I have a flashlight" carry along with it a temporary/fragile <i>blinding light</i> Aspect (for example)? <br/><br/>Am I just being <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">retarded</span> short-sighted here? I'm looking forward to the Lenny-Fred cage match.<br/><br/>New topic and I think this one will be done:<br/><br/>Re. this quote (from the other SotC thread) -- \n<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Is tagging enough like compelling that the taggee could buy off the tag with his own Fate (thereby paying the tagger)?</blockquote>\n<cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite><br/>The book is, to my chagrin, not as clear on this point as I would like it to be. But my answer is, "Definitely not."<br/><br/>Here's the fundamental dirty secret about compels: they're a Drama resolution system hidden inside a Fortune resolution system. You never combine the use of compels and the use of dice. You never go, "Okay, your enemy spills a drink on you, and you're not going to take it lying down - here's a fate point, and roll your Resolve to see if you can keep from punching him in the face." That's why the buyout option is there on a compel, because it's your only way to go, "No, I *am* taking it lying down, because there are more important things I'm worrying about. So I clench my fists and am totally angry, but I don't embarrass myself at this party."<br/><br/>Tagging has no such component, unless it's tagging for effect, which causes a compel. </blockquote>\nOkay, so just to be clear: You <i>cannot</i> "buy off" my tagging your Aspect to get the +2 or reroll, but you <i>can</i> "buy off" my tagging your Aspect for effect (which, as I understand it, is synonymous with "tagging your Aspect to compel").<br/><br/>I think I'm <i>this close</i> to getting all this internalized. I'm sure a couple more sessions of AP will help cement it all.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113188/#Comment_113188" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T18:51:55+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  6:51PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Am I just being short-sighted here?</blockquote>\nReally, the issue is that for all the supposedly precise language, adjudicating declarations comes down to a lot of very nebulous feeling out of stuff that will vary from group to group. Fred and I aren't really saying different things, but we're revealing the differences in how we perceive that nebulous stuff.<br/><br/>For example, the issue of "weightiness" (is that even a real noun?) comes up when you're talking about declarations made via invoking an aspect vs. just spending a fate point on one. If you have a relevant aspect, you should be able to get away with more stuff than you might get away with by just spending a fate point. So, in your group, if a player can spend a fate point to go, "The guards are asleep," he should be able to invoke "I Know a Guy" to say, "One of the guards actually works for a security company I own stock in, and I've seen him at company functions before. I go and say hi to him."<br/><br/>But, this is all relative - in another group, declaring that the guards are asleep might not even be kosher in the first place. And for Fred, he considers invoking for effect powerful enough to want to add more weight to a declaration if he feels not enough is there, like, "Oh, not only do you know the guy, but he really likes you and is going to help you with the break-in attempt." I might not do that as often.<br/><br/>Another issue has to do with the "locus of control" inherent to using different means of declaring. Anything to do with spending fate points is more about player authorship than character knowledge, whereas using a skill is explicitly the reverse. Like, in the above example, it'd be weird to me for the character to try and use a skill to say, "Someone I know happens to work in this building," - that's world editing stuff, stuff for fate points. Conversely, it'd be weird to blow a fate point on something like, "This device has a weak point I can exploit," if you're sitting there with an Engineering of Superb.<br/><br/>As for the economy stuff, I think you're getting too hung up on wanting to put symmetry where none need exist. The invoke/compel relationship, for example, is asymmetrical on purpose, which is why compels never give you a -2 on a roll or force you to take the worst of two rolls. But let me show you something:<br/><br/>Player invokes an aspect to declare that there's an aspect on a scene that he can use. He tags it for free, gets the +2 bonus, and has spent a total of one fate point. In terms of the economy, that's exactly the same as if the aspect was already on the scene, and he spent a fate point to tag it. In that sense, all the declaration did was justify that there was a relevant aspect available to invoke.<br/><br/>That's pretty much the reason why I'm cool with it - in the end, that spent fate point <i>does</i> get around to modifying a skill somewhere down the line. It creates no ripples in the economy because there's no point break to take advantage of, and there's no extra charge for doing it either. It's exactly the same as just invoking an aspect - only the justification part changes.<br/><br/>Also: I personally almost never charge a player for declaring anything that's pure color. If they're going into a dark cave, and someone slides over a fate point to say, "I have a flashlight," if I didn't have anything in mind regarding the darkness being a problem, I'm not going to charge for that. If I take that fate point, it's because I just came up with a reason for that flashlight to be damn important.<br/><br/>Finally:\n<blockquote>Okay, so just to be clear: You cannot "buy off" my tagging your Aspect to get the +2 or reroll, but you can "buy off" my tagging your Aspect for effect (which, as I understand it, is synonymous with "tagging your Aspect to compel").</blockquote>\nVery simply: If there's no compel involved anywhere along the line, there's no buyoff option. That's pretty much all you need to remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113281/#Comment_113281" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T08:45:47+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  8:45AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whew!

The economic ripple I see is that you're creating more invocation opportunities in a scene than you might have had previously. If it's temporary that's not a huge deal, but I can still see players stacking up a bunch of Fate invoking for effect and creating new fragile Aspects in order to double up the invokes/tags on a future exchange. I'm not sure that's "a bad thing", but there is a mechanical impact to that. If Fate = player authorship, then basically you're allowing players to expand their authorship footprint in a scene. Is that the intent?<br/><br/>The buyoff rule is very simple in my head now: It's attached to the Compel/Invoke for Effect, not to the Fate expenditure.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113339/#Comment_113339" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T11:28:40+00:00" title="December 10, 2007 11:28AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Can you use Fate to Declare an Aspect onto another character, or does this always require a Maneuver? My gut sense is that the authorship economy of SotC comes down to everything costing either a Fate or a Maneuver, so I could see simply dropping a Fate if you have an Aspect that's written to apply to other characters. Example: Aspect is "Scary as Hell." Can I drop a Fate and declare that you now have the aspect "Scared out of my wits!"?</blockquote>\nWell, "yes" but not that way.<br/><br/>If you're intimidating my character, you can tag "Scary As Hell" to get a bonus or reroll.  That's how you show anyone and everyone can be afraid of you.  In effect, anytime you invoke your aspect, you're giving "Scared Out Of My Wits" to everyone you're in conflict with at that time.  But you can't actually give me an aspect "scared out of my wits" without a manuever (or by rolling well enough to give me a consequence). If I had Timid Scientist (or something else fitting), then you could tag that as well.  So, you've already got a +4 or two rerolls without your manuever by using your existing aspect and one of mine. If you take an action to do a manuever instead of an Intimidation attack, then you've got +6 or three rerolls for an action (or for the rest of the encounter if it's a consequence, or made sticky).<br/><br/>In short, using existing aspects already in play are a powerful way to go.  If you need more of an edge, you need manuevers (if you can get a consequence, you probably already have a significant edge). However, letting someone add aspects without taking an action for a manuever seems potentially game breaking to me. Because in effect, you're tagging Scary As Hell twice, once for yourself, and once for your target. The manuever makes it a decision, "Do I want an edge on my next action, or do I just want to keep up my Intimidation now and do more Stress."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113370/#Comment_113370" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T13:45:09+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  1:45PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Whew!

The fate point you spend now is one you can't spend later. \n<blockquote>If it's temporary that's not a huge deal, but I can still see players stacking up a bunch of Fate invoking for effect and creating new fragile Aspects in order to double up the invokes/tags on a future exchange.</blockquote>\nYou're going to have to provide me a hypothetical example of what you're describing, because I'm not sure I follow you. If I'm reading you correctly, I'm not sure that what you're suggesting is a probable scenario. Or at least, that it doesn't provide you any breaks.<br/><br/>So, like, say your dude with [Scary as Hell] is accosting this NPC who is known to have the [Timid Scientist] aspect on him. He spends a Fate point and declares a [Scared Shitless of Me] aspect onto the guy. Then he rolls Intimidation to get info. If he tags the aspect he just made for free, he's spent one Fate point total and gets a +2. He could "double up" invoking his own aspect with the one he tagged, but he'd have to spend another fate point to do it. And that's two fate points he can't spend later.<br/><br/>Though, if you'll look at that example, you'll note it's pretty lame - any GM can look at that and go, "You already have an aspect that says you're scary. Why not just invoke that, and invoke his Timid Scientist aspect, which you already know he has?" I mean, like any game rule, you still need to execute common sense and discretion.\n<blockquote>If Fate = player authorship, then basically you're allowing players to expand their authorship footprint in a scene.

Placing an aspect with an aspect is really about broadening the justification for an invocation.<br/><br/>Like, look up the thread at the four examples I gave, and check out the warehouse one. The GM tells the player, "Hey, there's a shit-ton of crates in here, all with labels, and it's really [Cramped]," and does something to indicate that it's a scene aspect. The player is thinking, "Hey, it'd be nice if I could take advantage of that, but I'm not in a fight or anything, and really I'm here to find this secret info and get out." <br/><br/>So he uses the declaration to create an aspect that's more relevant to his situation. He couldn't say, "Yeah, I tag the Cramped aspect when I'm using Investigation to find the secret files," because that makes no sense. But he can say, "Hey, I'm using Cramped to declare that there's a central roster somewhere in here that catalogs the contents of all these crates, otherwise, how would they be able to keep track of them?" And then he tags that [Roster] aspect on his Investigation roll. But it still effectively cost him a point. <br/><br/>Could you technically call that a Leadership maneuver, because Leadership covers administration and bureaucracy? Eh, maybe, but that kind of feels counter-intuitive. It skirts that line between world-editing and character influence that makes it more appropriate for a fate point, to me. So that's why it's there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113383/#Comment_113383" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T14:07:32+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  2:07PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lenny, I think you're absolutely right.

Our group (based on our understanding), didn't play it that way.  Curious if that's a super-conscious design decision, GM-preference, or what?  I thought maneuvering to place an Aspect on a Scene was intentionally more attractive because 1) it might be easier to do that to go directly against your opponent and 2) because you wouldn't have to give a Fate point to a baddie.  I thought it was intentional to encourage players to get crazy with the set, contributing to a more dynamic fight.  Did running it that way (if you did test it that way) do something you didn't care for, or screw up the economy somehow?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113958/#Comment_113958" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T22:07:09+00:00" title="December 12, 2007 10:07PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wouldn't you give a fate point to a baddie <i>only</i> if you invoked the new aspect against him? <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113966/#Comment_113966" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T23:12:31+00:00" title="December 12, 2007 11:12PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Wouldn't you give a fate point to a baddie<i>only</i>if you invoked the new aspect against him?</blockquote>\nYeah.  It's only really relevant from the perspective of tagging-for-effect (compel triggering actions).<br/><br/>If you're tagging the scene aspect for an invoke-like effect, there's no fate point going to anyone.<br/><br/>So Matthew's right -- the scene still has a bit of an "advantage" in terms of its attractiveness as an aspect placement target.<br/><br/>The situations in my mind are sort of like this:<br/><br/>Scene has "On Fire!" on it.<br/><br/>As the GM I can compel "On Fire!" to trap folks inside the burning house as the flames rise higher.  Folks who agree to be trapped get a fate point.<br/><br/>As a player, you could tag for effect as the villain tries to get away.  "This place is On Fire!  He can't get away."  Because it's tagging for effect (look it up in the Aspects chapter; the language there is very precise and important), it's triggering a compel.  If the villain takes the fate point, he's trapped -- if he doesn't, he has to pay a fate point for his escape.  In *this* sense, the aspect's on his sheet, insofar as he's a viable target for compels of that aspect.<br/><br/>As a player, you could tag (in the invoking sort of way) for a +2 or reroll: "I swing my fists at him, backing him up towards the flames.  He starts to get singed.  +2 on my roll!"  This is just tagging a scene aspect; no fate point goes to the bad guy.<br/><br/>Sorry for being muddled in my earlier responses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114945/#Comment_114945" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T06:10:05+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  6:10AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay!

Can they all be touched only once per round/exchange?</blockquote>\nThe book says, "It is possible to use more than one aspect on a single roll, but you cannot use the same aspect more than once on the same roll or action; even if you\u2019ve re-rolled the dice, that\u2019s still the "same roll"." This is on page 39.<br/><br/>The text never implies a "once per exchange" invocation limit.

Change list:<br/><br/>* Noted that Consequences also add an Aspect to a character (under noun definition of Aspect)<br/><br/>* Rewrote definition for Taken Out to comply with Fate3 RAW (with option note referring to "faster conflicts")<br/><br/>* Changed "Aspect Creation" verb type to "Authorship." Shorter, slightly different implications, and it hews closer to my definition for Fate.<br/><br/>* General text tightening, lots of minor edits to address my flagrant pleonasty.<br/><br/>* A little bit of kerning to physically tighten up the text, which bought me a couple extra lines here and there.
