My advice is to play with Kaede as your primary, since her sniper scope coupled with the ease of acquiring the weak-point-lock-on power-up is pretty much the game's win button.

Otherwise the surreality simply becomes the reality of the imagined space. <br/><br/>The most Burroughsy game I heard about was a Sorcerer campaign set in Algeria... actually, I'm sure the AP is here <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11611&amp;page=1#Item_17" rel="nofollow">somewhere</a>. That said, the genius of <i>Killer7</i> is it's inimitable style; it's pure Suda. <br/><br/>Recently I've been mulling over a game that might be called something like "<i>Kar\u014dshi</i>." The premise is simple: the players are Japanese salarymen who must empty their inboxes, fufill their quotas and vie for promotion - all whist avoiding deadly stress-induced hallucinations. <br/>Basic keys-and-pool system but actions by other players 'lock out' the size of your pool and left-over dice go into two Lacuna-style 'static' gauges, one for events ("Suddenly, the shift-manager is all up in your grill") and another for surreality ("Only now do you notice your keyboard is made of viscous marshmallows"). Possibly a 'yes, and' system to help produce good surrealism.

Don't get frustrated or bored by the gameplay. Suda51 does this thing where he doesn't design mechanics for classically "fun" gameplay, he designs them for thematics (i.e. fun of a different kind than video gamers are used to). For instance, it's thematically relevant in K7 that your guys are restricted to moving along plotted lines while the bad guys are free to move all over the map. I swear, just about everything in that game is thematically significant.<br/><br/>(No More Heroes is maybe even stronger in this regard. It requires the pattern memorization, determination, and split-second button twitching for palm-sweating durations of time that hardcore games of the past did, all the while being a BITING satire of hardcore games and the culture that surrounds them.)<br/><br/>Mike: IA (or M&amp;C&amp;S, whichever) has been on my to-design list for ages. It hasn't got anywhere yet because it's hard to figure out. That said, I'm strongly leaning towards a <i>Spione</i> hack, at least to get started with before I scrap the first system to write the real one (which nearly always happens when I design a game). But what I really dream of is a system that uses Burroughs' repetition-with-a-twist technique (discussed and encouraged in The Rustbelt, but not mechanized) in a mechanically meaningful way, and also might involve cut-ups as a resolution mechanic. Big things that need to happen is ways for the scene (or Routine?) to wildly disjunct, for the story to unfold achronologically, and for nothing to ever happen the same way twice (thus preventing the surreality from becoming just another reality).<br/><br/>Tulpa: they would accelerate as fast as you wanted them to, but there'd also have to be times when it happened unbidden. Although I'll probably let the sexual stuff be customizeable; I'm more interested in BDSM happening than anal sex, and Burroughs was the other way around.<br/><br/>Wilmer: It's coming along. I had to scrap a big chunk of GM techniques (ripped off of Cruel Fortunes from <i>Poison'd</i>) to start writing an even better set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272498/#Comment_272498" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T14:48:22+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  2:48PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2010 2:48PM by Potemkin.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I prefer Ignorant Armies.
