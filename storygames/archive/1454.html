                            Review of Tragedy, by Eva Schiffer<br/><br/>	In Tragedy, we have a good beta version of a game ripe for playtest and further development.  The basic concept is to reboot and roleplay a Shakespearean tragedy, with each player working towards one or more tragic ends.  It relies heavily on freeform roleplaying techniques, and weighs in on the "guided story collaboration" end of the roleplaying spectrum.<br/><br/>Playability of the game - 7/10<br/>	I have no doubt that this game could be played as-is and produce an enjoyable evening perhaps 70% of the time.  A good solid playtest or three could iron out the kinks in currency and responsibilities, but more importantly the game lacks a strong sense of what the players should be doing at any given point in time.  I suspect that the strong core of the game exists in Eva's head; the game text just needs some focusing the bring it more into line with her plans and expectations.<br/>	The development of characters as they proceed towards their inevitably tragic ends is clever and intriguing, but the actual procedures to guide the players there is obscure at best.  It's all there, but could be explained in better detail and format.  The flowcharts are not necessary and were something of a turn off for me.  The rules are simple enough that they can be described in the main text just fine.<br/><br/>Usefulness of the character sheet - 9/10<br/>	Eva got one of the most "interesting" character sheets in the challenge, Shreyas' creation which cut the sheet into pieces and then used arrows to connect different elements on three lists.  The interactive elements of the sheet were put to brilliant use, and the game's progression engages the sheet directly.  Equating each list with a different Act was clever; turning the pathways created between items into character traits was an inspired leap of design.<br/>	My only hesitation is in player control over the pathways created.  The control is not absolute, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but what control a player has and when is not adequately explained.  It also appears that the more prominent your character becomes and the more you play towards your "shift theme" the more likely it is that you will be forced to shift your list up or down.  Playing well seems to result in a loss of control.  Either I have not understood the intended effect of the rules or the benefits of this feedback cycle is not clearly explained; either way the rules text could be clearer on how the sheet is used.<br/><br/>Wow, thatâ€™s cool factor. - 6/10<br/>	Rewriting Shakespearean plays in real time at the table?  Awesome.  Unfortunately, while this is patently the game's genesis, the game has strayed from that original kernel. This design would have been a lot stronger if it had stayed with its inspiration rather than trying to make the game universal.  This late-stage conceptual retooling is most evident in the Writing Playbills section; the suggestions to use eighties high school movies or science fiction operas rings false, more appropriate to a sidebar option than a central procedure in the main text.  Writing Playbills would be considerably simplified if the procedure was simply to take the Dramatis Personae from any of the eleven Shakespearean tragedies and go from there.<br/>	Lastly, while the characters' ends are almost certainly tragic, the game as it stands misses the most important aspect of the tragedy, the acheivement of catharsis.  Tragic characters fall, yes, but in doing so they make their world a better place or lead the audience to understanding something about the human character.  The tragic character is a sacrifice for the betterment of everyone else.  While players intent on creating this can certainly attain that through the game, there is nothing that will guide other players to succeed in emulating the game's namesake.<br/><br/>Total Score: 22/30<br/>	I like this game, and I'd love to see it developed further.  The central kernel is intriguing, and the use of the sheet is inspired.  Tragedy does not have far to go to be an excellent game.                        </div>

                            Specimen for the Resurrection, by Paul Czege<br/><br/>Playability 6/10<br/>In the most simple terms I can muster, Paul has created a game that is deeply affecting, demanding of your emotions, and entirely tragic. The game in no uncertain terms asks you, the player, to judge humanities worth in the face of extinction.<br/><br/>See, the basis of this game is that humanity has long since gone the way of the dinosaurs and cosmic beings with the power to resurrect humanity has sent probes (artificial humans) back into time to live ordinary lives, to sin, to grieve, to forgive, to repent, to laugh, to be human. At the end of the session, these probes are brought forth to the cosmic beings and made to judge whether humanity should live again. I found myself quite emotional while reading this short game, and am convinced no one could do this game justice.<br/><br/>While the rules seem solid, they are a bit confusing as it require the players to use a set of six-sided dice with a special numbering sequence not commonly available: Sicherman Dice. Additionally, while examples are given of how situations are resolved, no solid idea of what the players are suppose to be doing is presented. I got the idea that the intention is to present a series of vignettes, slices of life, but I could be wrong.<br/><br/>With such a strong concept that demands the most of the players abilities, I simply felt the rules to back it up were a little short and awkward.<br/><br/>Integration of the Character Sheet 9/10<br/>Paul had a handful with Selene Tan's character sheet. I'm happy to say that Paul made the most of it's rather intimidating design and every little detail of the character is used in the game, although what the game requires a person to write in a given space is often much longer than the space allows, but it is a small factor.<br/><br/>What impresses me the most is not only how the rules use the sheet, but how Paul constructed the game in such a way that if I had not known about the Rev/Eng challenge, I would swear Paul created the sheet specifically for the game. Selene's sheet invokes a certain feel, an intensity, that is matched by the game.<br/><br/><br/>Wow, That's Cool 9/10<br/>Upon reading Specimen for the Resurrection, I literally thought to myself, "Wow...that's cool. I could play 12 Monkeys with this game." And so I could. Specimen for the Resurrection treads into those areas of gaming that are sensitive for most gamers: Introspection. It asks the players to make tough decisions about life, to examine the human condition, and then to sit in judgement. My friends....that is most certainly cool.<br/><br/>Total: 24/30<br/>Specimen for the Resurrection is a challenging little game, that I'm very pleased to have reviewed. All I can say is, I would love to see the concept expanded, and detailed. Fine tune the rules, and perhaps find another dice mechanic, because as it stands, the funky dice situation probably would prevent many people from playing a game that quite franky, needs to be played.                        </div>

                            The Best Thing, by Mark Vallianatos<br/><br/><br/>The Best Thing takes the players to a fictional empire with some Chinese flavour. While the Emperor is sick and going to die without proper medical treatment, the players take the role of wise healers, mystics and/or charlatans who want to get famous by making the Emperor an Immortal.<br/><br/>The game has a very strict mechanic structure. The play progresses in Seasons, and each season each player can decide whether his or her character travels to the Lands Beyond to gain more Knowledge or remain in the capital to get more contacts at court. The characters need both to get an appointment with the Emperor and cure him successfully.<br/><br/>During play can choose whether they want to cooperate or hinder each other. I think this is meant to be what Vincent calls the Fruitful Void. If they hinder each other, they might get the fame for themselves, but if they do it too much, the Emperor might die. The problem I see here is that the helping/hindering mechanic is  uses the same resource players need to improve their own characters. This reminds me of the Drama Dice in 7th Sea where players have to choose either doing cool stuff or getting a better character, too. In 7th Sea that is a very unfortunate connection, and it might turn out the same way in The Best Thing. (Of course it may come out different in actual play.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Playability   8/10<br/>As for the mechanics the game takes the term "funky dice tricks" to a whole new level. The central mechanic requires rolling a number equal to the Knowledge used and then assembling the dice in the shape represented on the character sheet. Then the player can activate and narrate the use of Assets in order to attach more dice to shape. Also other players can now spent the aforementioned Tokens to add or substract dice and narrate their help or sabotage.<br/><br/>The the active player will take "Sweeps" over the assembled dice as indicated by the type of obstacle, Season and Region adding the dice he or she comes across in order to beat a difficulty number. That means there is quite a bit of tactics in choosing each season the right Knowledge, right obstacles and right Region. It would have been nice, though, to have rules for using additional Knowledges in a season like, say, Trollbabe and Galactic use additional abilities. This way there is only one Knowledge per season.<br/><br/>Things I did not understand are exactly how to Sweep and the rules for the Emperors diseases are inconsistent. The text mentions that in the beginning there are only rumours about the maladies of his majesty, but later in the Treatment chapter they all seem to be real. Still the game should be playable.<br/><br/><br/>Integration of the Character Sheet   9/10<br/>Simply great. Better than I would have done it, and I made that sheet. I find it particularly interesting that Mark used more then half of the elements for pacing and structure, although I would have used them to describe the character. Mark's attempt is probably better.<br/><br/>Only the Influence section does not really describe influence but contacts at court, but this is a slight cosmetic problem at most.<br/><br/><br/>Wow, That's Cool   7/10<br/>Fantasy with Eastern elements is cool all by itself, and the text offers some nice ideas for using them. Also the theme of cooperation vs. sabotage reminds me of the prisonerâ€™s dilemma, which is cool.<br/><br/><br/>Total: 24/30<br/>With some slight changes to the rules I see big potential for a nice little game.                        </div>

                            Angels of Tangut, by Jack Aidley<br/><br/>Angels of Tangut is, as admitted by Jack, not a complete game, but what is presented makes for a somewhat disjointed promise, a glimmer, of something very remarkable. Characters are angels (however you conceive them) that roam a Tibetan landscape created by the players collectively, solving conflicts and problems with the locals. In this respect, the premise is very much like a Tibetan version of Dogs in The Vineyard, although it hides this connection well.<br/><br/>Playability 4/10<br/>AoT has a strong premise, but fails in itâ€™s execution. Again, one can hardly blame itâ€™s lack of execution when the product isnâ€™t finished, but Iâ€™m required to give it a score in this regard.<br/><br/>Of particular interest to me is the way the players (called a troupe) collectively create an area of land and place  villages, castles, ruins, roads, and other interesting locales before they then populate them with people, facts, conflicts, and relationships. This concept alone is very cool, but has some wasted effort. For example, the first step is to create the contours and elevations of the landscape and it takes some time to do. While it may be aesthetically pleasing, it serves no purpose what-so-ever.<br/><br/>Players create characters (the angels), and use a rotating GM to then explore each local in an attempt to solve the various problems of the local. This part of the rules got the shortest amount of attention, but holds a lot of promise. What I particularly like, and would hope to see more of in further drafts, is how the characters create spiritual shockwaves throughout the land by their actions. Angels do not tread softly in this game.<br/><br/>Despite the neat set-up, there really is too much missing to be playable without a lot of kludging.<br/><br/><br/>Integration of Character Sheet 7/10<br/>Jack serviced the character sheet well, making use of everything, but all in all, a rather uninspired use. However, this journeyman-like use really fits the game concept, so it works well, and does one neat trick by way of rolling a die and moving a marker around the tangut symbols to create a certain amount of randomness in the character in each conflict.  It reminds me of when athletes talk about not being at their best for a competition: AoT provides a way for characters to in-effect, have their good days and bad days.<br/><br/><br/>Wow, thatâ€™s Cool 6/10<br/>I really want to score this game higher on this account, but by virtue of not being a complete game, I canâ€™t. There is too much missing, and really, the inclusion of those missing elements would push this game over the top. Mostly what is missing is details, examples, and simply more things to do for the angels than fly around solving problems. Plus, AoT has no ending or reward mechanic. What happens when the angels solve all the problems in the land they created? Some kind of transcendence for the angels? Move on to another land? Itâ€™s never addressed and thatâ€™s a shame as it gives nothing for the angels to strive for. That said, AoT is a very cool game as it is, and Jack has created something worthwhile.<br/><br/>Total 17/30<br/>AoT holds great promise, but as it stands now, AoT is just thatâ€¦a promise.  I strongly urge Jack Aidley to complete this game. A completely realized game, with nice layout and some decent art would kick a serious amount of gaming ass and Iâ€™d be his first customer.                        </div>

                            Artifact Retrieval Corps, by David Wendt<br/><br/>ARC is a science fiction game set in the far future where Captain Kirk would have been rewarded for constantly violating the prime directive. There is a couple of lines in the opening paragraphs that ostensibly serves as the premise for the game;  â€œ..hard work on strange worlds, often populated by disgruntled species who think youâ€™re there to steal their godsâ€ and â€œEach artifact you help recover brings us one step closer to unlocking the secrets of the ancientsâ€. <br/><br/>Along with the title of the game, Artifact Retrieval Corps, this makes the game all the more curious as almost zero information is given about the ancients, their secrets, or the artifacts.  Given the pip happy character sheet David was given to work with, I get the distinct feeling that David spent his two weeks integrating the character sheet and had less time for world-building.<br/><br/>Playability 6/10<br/>ARC does an admirable job in character creation, providing many options in design, but then provides almost no reason for the characters to do anything. There is a random conflict generator which is quite neat, but it does not make for a campaign or even a one-shot (the example use of it has the players being attacked by ninjas). Itâ€™s actually quite depressing: ARC does a wonderful job in character creation, in fact, if I were to judge that alone, it would get 9 or maybe 10 out of 10.  However, the remaining rules are quite sparse, poorly organized, and a tad confusing. The dice mechanic is quite nice, but not nearly discussed enough. It took me several read throughs before I understood how it worked, and thatâ€™s only after making some inferences. <br/><br/>Whatâ€™s worse, as mentioned above, outside of a couple of quick mentions, no direction is given to the characters other than to â€˜retrieve artifactsâ€™. What these artifacts are, what purpose they serve, and why they are needed, is never explained. Nor is any information given how they are supposed to retrieve them: Guns aâ€™blazing? Diplomacy? Burglary?<br/><br/>ARC needs a lot more effort in the â€˜Whyâ€™ department to make it anything more than a really neat character creation machine.<br/><br/>Integration of Character Sheet 10/10<br/>The unfortunate thing about ARC is that David spent a lot of effort to make the character sheet work, he really has, and itâ€™s a monument to design that it doesnâ€™t feel kludged or half-ass with the rules. Given the two page character sheet gives you many tools to use by the title of sections, but then drops a hammer on your toes with many pips, David outdid himself in the integration. Given the rules as created, this it the perfect fit for the character sheet.<br/><br/>Wow, thatâ€™s Cool 5/10<br/>Quite frankly, the setting is a fairly standard, uninspired, sci-fi, with intergalactic wars, ancient civilizations, and with apparently hundreds of alien species about on limitless worlds, but only a handful of races getting the barest mention. Space ships are mentioned only once by name, and a second time by inference, while there is only one mention of any kind of weapon (needle gun) and two other pieces of equipment (a health meter, and an automatic food processor). While I certainly didnâ€™t expect a list of equipment, at least an explanation of the expected technology level would have gone a long way. As an example, the only description of artifacts is: High Tech.  What constitutes high tech?<br/><br/>While David makes mention that the setting is supposed to be highly customizable, the rules gave us no tools to customize, effectively putting the onus on the players to find something to do with their characters.<br/><br/>Total 21/30<br/>ARC is perfect as far as reverse engineering the character sheet goes, with a solid, and fun character creation system. I would advise David to spend the time creating a solid , inspiring setting,  and solid motivations for characters. I personally would love to know more about the artifacts, the ancients, and why they must be retrieved.                        </div>

                            Review of Tristan Brightman's <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Self-lessTRISTANBRIGHTMAN.pdf" rel="nofollow">Self-Less</a> (based on <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/mikeRMsheetonly.pdf" rel="nofollow">my sheet</a>).<br/><br/>I created my sheet to restrict the game designer as little as possible â€“ hence, no words or symbols appeared anywhere on the sheet. I evidently succeeded in my plan, since Tristan did something I never would have thought of (and it wasn't Selene Tan's suggestion of folding it into a box, which seems to have inspired a number of subsequent sheet designers). What I originally had in mind with the little bars across the lines was that they were doorways in a kind of labyrinth, but Tristan looked at them and saw barbed wire â€“ so he wrote a "horror" game.<br/><br/>By the way, thanks to Tristan for including the line: "Take the character sheet; admire it's artistic design and elegant function." (Even though that's the wrong version of "its".)<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'm meant to score it or not, since I'm just the sheet designer doing a review, and I know my scores don't count. But in case I am meant to, here are my scores.<br/><br/>Playability of the game: 8. It sounds very playable and is generally clearly explained, but the first time I read it I missed the rule for when the HP moves around the circle.<br/>Integration of the character sheet into the game: 10. I can't see how it would be humanly possible to use the character sheet more than Tristan does.<br/>General cool factor: 7. I docked some points here for incorrect punctuation, non-inclusive language and layout (the lack of whitespace beside the boxes), all of which are things I care about more than many other people do, but it is actually very cool in its concept and execution. The idea that the horror player moves seats, and that this changes the way in which the two players communicate, is excellent. I'm very pleased to have such a cool game built from my sheet.<br/><br/>Total: 25.<br/><br/>Thanks to Kevin for running this contest. It meant that I got to "collaborate" with someone I've never met on the other side of the world, who produced a game I never would have come up with. That's excellent.                        </div>

                            Guardian Angels, by William Burke<br/><br/>This review is rather depressing to write as the game fails on so many levels, but it holds such a solid, engaging premise. In short, you play guardian angels that dick around with some poor mortalâ€™s life, causing havoc or joy. Youâ€™ve seen it countless times in movies and cartoons; the angel and devil sitting on a persons shoulder trying to convince him on a course of action. Yeah, this game is a lot like that. And the idea is funâ€¦very fun. <br/><br/>Playability 3/10<br/>Unfortunately this game is not complete. Too many concepts are left without explanation or under explained. No examples are given. Players essentially place or move dice around the character sheet, and the resulting placement or movement causes narration in-game, but a meta-conflict between players. In effect, players take turns describing how bad (and sometimes good) things happen to the mortal, only limited by where the dice are located in the mortalâ€™s life. Read that last sentence again. Everything else in the game is based around increasing your influence by decreasing others, so that you have total narrative rights. When that happens, the player wins the game.<br/><br/>Angels have no interaction with each other, since itâ€™s narration about the Mortalâ€™s life and not about the angelâ€™s involvement in it. The only time players interact with each other is if their dice try to occupy the same spot. The mechanic to resolve these collisions is confusing and somewhat arbitrary (Prime Example: A â€˜bumpâ€™ is a means to increase your influence in game. At any time, ANY TIME, players can simply shake hands, and each gets a â€˜bumpâ€™. Any time. Without consequence. So what then is to prevent players from doing so right from the start?) Since there is a total of 8 spots, and each player is recommended to have a minimum of 9 dice, it seems the game is going to be using this rule quite often.<br/><br/>My impression of this game is that itâ€™s a narrativist Chutes &amp; Ladders thatâ€™s missing most of the rules.<br/><br/>Integration of Character Sheet 5/10<br/>The character sheet is used in what I thought was an obvious manner, but really didnâ€™t exceed expectations. It seems an omission to use certain elements in a sub-par fashion, such as the circles along the paths that have an obvious space for the players to write in a label, but are unused in the game. However, it is clever that the character sheet is only used for the NPC (the mortal) and not the players.<br/><br/>Wow, thatâ€™s Cool 8/10<br/>Let me restate from above; â€œyou play guardian angels that dick around with some poor mortalâ€™s lifeâ€. How is that not totally cool? Itâ€™s sublime. William adds another dimension to the â€œkill them and take their stuffâ€ by changing the concept to â€œtorture them and take their soulâ€. <i>Brilliant</i>.<br/><br/>Total 16/30<br/>Simply stated, this game is playable only with a lot of guess work. My recommendation to William is to drop the character sheet altogether, and start over with the premise. Itâ€™s a solid, beautiful, and highly perverse idea that could be RPG gold with the right attention and rules.                        </div>

                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>Yes and no. I would argue that it's all part of the judging criteria. We are being asked to judge how well the character sheet was integrated into the game. If I see a portion of the sheet that looks underused, or not used at all, it's less integration. It's obviously my opinion (whatever it's worth), but not about <i>interpreting</i> the sheet, but about <i>use</i> of the sheet.<br/><br/>EDIT: Shreyas, have you looked at the character sheet in question?                        </div>

                            Fair enough. The more reviews of each game the better. After all, I'm only offering one insight/opinion. My trash is your gold, and vice versa, and all that.<br/><br/>As an aside, I know time is limited for people, but I would have liked to see more <i>required</i> reviews so that each game got 4 to 6 reviews. With only two required, I think any extreme opinion can raise or lower a games score unfairly.                        </div>

                            Children of the Sun, Children of the Moon<br/>Game: Russell Collins<br/>Sheet: Nathan Paoletta<br/><br/>I like this game a lot. It's packed with good ideas: the idea of two characters combining to become a true Traveller is golden, the starlands sound fantastic and the mechanics around passing poker chips are superbly ingenious. It's a great use of the character sheet and I hope it goes on to be developed. That said, I'm worried about that central mechanic and how it'll impact playability.<br/><br/>I'd like to see the rules revised, too, for a bit more clarity. For example, I think the three sorts of chips are different colours, but I can't find where it says that: did I miss that? Oh, and there's two Ls in Traveller, of course, but lots of Americans make that mistake.<br/><br/>1. Playability 5<br/><br/>It's a shame, really, that I'm marking this game on playability. If we were marking on potential, I'd give a much higher mark. I think these rules are ingenious and, with tweaking, will be a fantastic ruleset. Right now, though, I'm worried about the playability.<br/><br/>Firstly, I'm worried about the description of the way the game proceeds: "Travellers move freely through the star lands, interacting with its peoples and observing the scenery until the Guide presents a foe". It makes the game sound like merely a series of foes: and, indeed, the example adventure does read like that.<br/><br/>What I <i>think</i> Russell's aiming for is "Say yes or roll the dice", along the lines of DitV. But DitV presents a series of moral dilemmas that the players must cope with and that's a rather different thing to a series of foes. Also, note that DitV lets the players launch conflicts: in this game, it's always, I think, the GM who initiates a foe. Stop me if I've got that wrong.<br/><br/>Secondly, I'm worried about the way the GM chooses the type of foe. For example, the GM chooses a Love obstacle, which the players must combat with Love. I can imagine the GM presenting a Love obstacle and the players wanting to overcome it with, say, Void: for example, in the conflict example in the text, I <i>really</i> want to hit that Vizier. But I couldn't, because I've got to overcome him with Love.<br/><br/>And, because you can only beat him with Love, the conflicts are likely to consist mainly of narration about emotions and Love. It would be nice to have some variety: a Love gambit, say, followed by an attempt at Void to defeat the obstacle, then another try at Love. Note how, in the play example, the whole narration is an emotional argument, with points for and against. I'd much rather one player was trying to convince the Vizier while another was crawling through the rafters ready to fire a crossbow at him if he refused. With the current ruleset, I think that's unlikely to happen.<br/><br/>And, thirdly, I'm unclear as to how narration interacts with the poker chips. It <i>looks</i>, from the play example, as though you only narrate when you play a chip of the same type as the obstacle (Love, in the example), and then you narrate something appropriate to that type (in the example, arguments). If that's so, it'll make for a rather one-tracked narration.<br/><br/>All that sounds rather harsh, but I think the ruleset could be fantastic: the spinning of the coin to choose the Sphere is great; so is the passing of the chips; so's the ideas behind Love and Moon. But I think it needs tweaking.<br/><br/>2. Integration of Character Sheet 9<br/><br/>The character sheet is beautiful and it's well integrated. Russell has taken all the various elements and formed a story around them, and it's a great story. Even the barrier down the middle of the character sheet makes sense.<br/><br/>It's not <i>quite</i> perfect: the term "Void" doesn't quite seem to correspond to "Physical Force" and Refreshes aren't really refreshes. But it's really good.<br/><br/>3. Wow, That's Cool 7<br/><br/>The mechanics are really, really cool. They'll make a great game (after, I think, some adjustments).<br/><br/>The setting is cool too. The starlands are a beautiful idea for a setting and the backstory's quite good too. And much of the backstory - for example, the true Travellers being open to corruption - is actually reflected in the mechanics, in a very cool way.<br/><br/>So, that score of 7, for me, means: I like this game and, if I saw it was being played at a convention, I'd definitely want to play. An 8 would have meant "I really like this game and I'd play it like a shot" and a 10 "I'm completely obsessed by this game and would kill to get a copy".<br/><br/>So, although I really like it, it's not pushing <i>all</i> my buttons. I've said before that, when I read Dogs In The Vineyard, I feel as though I can smell the air and see the waterfalls in the mountains. I'm not getting that feeling with the star lands. And I'm not, quite, getting the feeling that I <i>want</i> to solve the corruption in the star lands: whereas, with DitV, I want to get stuck right in.<br/><br/>But it's a nice game. I'd like to see the mechanics changed, a little, and then I'd love to play it.<br/><br/>[Edited because, as mentioned below, I got the game designer and sheet designer muddled.]                        </div>

                            Chimaera<br/>Game: Fred Hicks (or possibly Rob Donoghue, it's hard to tell)<br/>Character Sheet: Adam Dray<br/><br/>Yeah, forget that thing I said about marking low. This is great.<br/><br/>1. Playability 9<br/><br/>The game looks almost completely playable. The world / game creation system looks great. The conflicts look great.<br/><br/>If I have one doubt, it's about the two types of scene and the allocation of characters. By defining a conflict scene as a "Conflict Scene", you instantly launch into, well, conflict. It might be nicer if the conflict <i>grew</i> out of a scene about something else.<br/><br/>Also, the allocation of characters. In the play example for the conflict scene, the GM has automatically taken a general sort of Robots-And-Evil-Laboratory-opposition role. Could this be explained in more detail? Could the players (and GM) be guided into what sort of roles they should take? (For example: "The GM should usually take a general opposition role. If it's a team-fights-evil scene, the players should take their own characters and battle the GM, who should play a general "force of evil". If it's a one-character-against-the-world scene, one player should play his own character, while another player could play the evil villain, leaving the GM to play general mook opposition." Something like that.).<br/><br/>But it's great and looks as though it could be played as it is.<br/><br/>2. Use of character sheet 10<br/><br/>It's an amazing character sheet and it's been used brilliantly. The use of the flaps, with different positions indicating different states, is inspired. The glass bead thing is very cool.<br/><br/>If this game were developed, I think the glass-bead-sliding would be more interesting if some of the web links weren't present. That would mean, for example, that to get to "Body" you'd have to go via your "Mind" trait (say).<br/><br/>3. Wow, That's Cool 8<br/><br/>It really is a very cool game. I'm not usually into Godzilla-esque games, but this one makes it sound fun: and adds some emotional depth, too. I'd love to try the world creation system.<br/><br/>The reason it's eight rather than ten is purely subjective and hard to explain. It's a great game and I'd love to play it. But it's not <i>quite</i> my thing: I'd rather play a detective game than a monster game. And I'd rather buy a game where I'm overwhelmed with the setting (DitV, MLWM) than one which lets me make my own (although the Murdered Earth idea is great). And something like Mechaton, which isn't a million miles away genre-wise, appeals more: it gives me toys to fiddle with. Still, it's a game that I'd suggest playing and I'd enthusiastically play if someone was running.<br/><br/>This is great stuff: I do hope it gets developed.                        </div>

                            OK, I have negative time to review stuff, but here's what I submitted:<br/><br/>THE COURT<br/>Troy Holaday<br/><a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/TheCourtTROYHOLADAY.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/TheCourtTROYHOLADAY.pdf</a><br/><br/>The game itself seems solid, although playtesting will tell.  It struck me as remarkably well thought out and potentially fun to play.  There is the potential for some very subtle interplay between components and characters.  I wish the character sheet, although cool, could be dispensed with, to allow the chess board to be the focal point of a more free-wheeling social game with LARP overtones - maybe using different colored beads to represent primary traits or something?  I loved the Lewis chessmen drawings.  It was well laid out, easy to understand, and attractive.

But this was a challenging sheet and this game has a lot of potential.  The game is definitely integrated tightly with the sheet.  I really like the use of Fearful Symmetry and Glyphs, particularly the "selfish mutualism" required in choosing them.  Creating locations and challenges seems fun.  The Tangut itself is awesome.

Eleventh Hour is that game.<br/><br/>Comments:<br/>I feel like this is a strong concept with an interesting mechanic (using playing cards in a bidding war) but the premise didn't do enough lifting to really *hook* me. Still, there's some real gems in here, which I think could gain a lot from some careful selection, cut, and polish through playtesting.  <br/><br/>The sheet rotates, operating in different modes depending on how far into the resolution of things; the in-game time is definitely "on the clock", as the dinner party starts going to hell at eleven o'clock, and hell is fully realized, in all its phantasmagoric glory, by the time you hit midnight.  There are strong player vs. player competitive elements, though really this is a game where there's only one winner, and it's a nasty path at that.  <br/><br/>But something just didn't grab me about it.  Maybe I wanted the sheet to have more fiddly with it, and though I don't think the designer did a bad job with what he was given, I felt like a 7 was a solid enough way to say "job well done!".  (My ratings of 8-10 tend to indicate some level of surprise, more or less)  But ultimately I struggled with the premise (I'm not sure I want to play a dinner party gone wrong with Vincent Price and his sadistic brethren as my guests) and some of the presentation (I wanted a strong example of play, and I could have gone for a font that emphasized readability over atmosphere).  I do think that with some extra props and some additional dimensions of play, this could become a solid role-playing game, but more than anything I almost want it to be more of a board game.  Like Clue might be, if everyone was guilty.                        </div>

by Jason Morningstar</p>
<p><em>Playability:</em> 4<br/>
I'm not sure how to read "playability" here, since we don't have very explicit standards. I do feel that this game falls below average, though; as far as I can tell, there is no good reason you shouldn't choose to start with an agent with the highest possible value, and the mechanical choices you make during the game don't feel very closely tied with descriptive choices.</p>
<p>I also found myself boggling at the organisation of the text - frequently there are mechanical statements (the one about earning tokens for recruiting agents, to take an example) that are not adjacent to the procedures you'd use adjacent to them in play (i.e. the recruiting procedure), and I feel like this is problematic. I didn't consider it when scoring, but I wanted to point it out. If the game goes farther it <em>must</em> be arranged better.</p>
<p><em>Integration of the sheet:</em> 0<br/>
I don't feel like I need to elaborate very much on this. Jason didn't integrate the sheet.</p>
<p><em>Wow, that's cool! Factor:</em> 5<br/>
About average for a historical game; I don't tend to find games with historical premises particularly exciting, and I'm having great difficulty imagining this game's playing out as other than a sequence of unconnected events, many of which will look like tea parties. It's a bummer, 'cause a game about like people fighting for peace is a strong concept, but this implementation totally failed to hook me.</p>
<p>Total: 9.</p>
<p>(man, now I feel like a total hardass and that is really not me. YLQ coming up.)</p>

                            Dangerous Ideas<br/>Game by Lucian Smith<br/>Sheet by Paul Czege<br/><br/>Dangerous Ideas is a game about competing philosophies and memes, fighting to take control over a familiar story and twist its telling to their own agenda. Both the game, and the sheet it is based on, are strikingly original and frighteningly innovative. <br/><br/>Playability: 6<br/><br/>As written, Dangerous Ideas seems perfectly playable, if a little confusing and at times, both in terms of the premise and the presentation of the rules.<br/><br/>The premise is a bit of a mind bender, and although Lucian does very well with it, I felt that the game could have done with a bit more explanation and guidance as to what constitutes a Dangerous Idea, and what Memes might be appropriate to each. A few example Dangerous Ideas would have helped greatly.<br/><br/>The game could do with more clarifications, and perhaps a reordering of the sections so that the basic concepts and features are explained up front, rather than addressed as they crop up in the rules. This had me searching through the rules to find an explanation for a concept introduced in one part, but not explained til much later. <br/><br/>The examples of play help greatly, however, and allow you to see the rules in play â€“ believe me when I say this is a must.<br/><br/>Usefulness of Sheet: 10<br/><br/>Given one of the more complicated and crazy sheets, it is perhaps all the more surprising that Lucian has managed to integrate every aspect (even those elements I assumed were purely graphical) of Paulâ€™s sheet into his game. He has done so elegantly and seamlessly, and I would argue that it would be impossible to integrate the sheet any more.<br/><br/>Cool Factor: 7<br/><br/>The concept of playing competing philosophies trying to gain control of a story is at once brilliant and insane. I think it would terrify my players, and to be honest it scares me a little, but I want to tell the story of Little Red Riding Hood with a Marxist philosophy!<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Lucian Smith has taken one of the most innovative sheets and made it into an even more innovative game. The sheet and the game work together very well, and although the game itself could do with a few more examples, a bit more clarification and tightening up of the rules, I would say that Dangerous Ideas is a success.<br/><br/>Total: 23                        </div>

<p>Jason, are you planning anything further for Red Strings? I'd be interested in seeing what you'd do with it, given some time to like build the game that concept deserves.</p>

by Meguey Baker<br/>
<a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/EvaSchiffer.pdf" rel="nofollow">Sheet</a> by Eva Schiffer</p>
<p><em>Playability:</em> 6<br/>
This is pretty clearly explained in many ways; however I feel like there's not as much support as I'd like in some key areas, like how one would describe Dangers (it seems like these are pretty abstract and disconnected from their mechanical implications) and how to decide who faces a particular peril - there are lots of ways I can think of handling this, but I'd like to know Meg's way. It seems like this one choice will strongly affect the tone of the game via its economic effects.</p>
<p>Also I've got no idea what it means to "use Lnd and Estates ... to bring up your Accomplishments"; this needs to be explained properly for the game to be played as intended. It seems to be an important thing! I've also got very little idea of how to apply "How will you show them all," which seems like it should drive play, but it's very mysterious exactly <em>how.</em></p>
<p>In general I suspect this could be a solid system, under the condition that the whole system is actually written down. Unfortunately it isn't.</p>
<p><em>Integration of the sheet:</em> 6<br/>
Pretty solid; nothing obvious on the sheet is unused, though some of the uses are not particularly interesting (Obsession, for instance, gets filled in but it's got no explicit play effect; Martial status seems like it's supposed to have a systemic effect that's again not written out in full).</p>
<p>I particularly liked the use of Nationality to create amusing stereotypes. It made me smile!</p>
<p><em>Wow, that's cool! Factor:</em> 5<br/>
I was really charmed by the pulpy/backstabby concept of mad women-of-science competing to be the best at school here, and I'd really love to see the game deliver on both aspects of that. I think it's got a good start on the pulpiness, but the competition is glossed over. So, it's average on that count - it promises a really great thing and delivers an okay thing.</p>
<p>Total: 17</p>
<p>Thanks for making games that were so much fun to read and review, Jason and Meg! Thanks for sheets, Eva and Ashok!</p>

It creates an economy where player have to decide when to use their â€œstick it to â€˜emâ€ dice pool, and has desirable feedback features all inherent in the elegant design.<br/><br/>But thatâ€™s about all that the author did. Players are supposed to freely narrate their sins in monologue, with very little encouragement for player interaction of any kind. The entire role-playing portion of the game is simply a one-at-a-time free-form, punctuated by the dice pool mechanic. Thereâ€™s not much to get things started, and nothing that really helps the players to build anything narratively. In fact, I think the mechanics will inadvertently encourage the creation of disconnected vignettes.<br/><br/>The character sheet seems to have been ignored almost entirely, with the vast bulk of the sheet relegated to decoration.<br/><br/>I would like to see the clever dice mechanic idea saved and incorporated as one element in a more developed game. It was a well-designed component, but canâ€™t carry an entire game all by itself.                        </div>

                            THE FACILITY<br/>Game: <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/TheFacility-DaveCleaver.pdf" rel="nofollow">David Cleaver</a><br/>Sheet: <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Jack%20Aidley.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jack Aidley</a><br/><br/>Playability: 2<br/>Integration: 9<br/>Cool Factor: 3<br/><br/>There are some cool ideas for a game lurking around in here. Many provided by the sheet, and additional ones brought by the author. I am keen to see further development, because I think there is a lot of upside to the concepts that I can see being hatched here. The author clearly "bought into" the concept of the character sheet, and did an excellent job staying true to it. The result is a strong direction toward an intriguing game concept.<br/><br/>But, as currently written, the game is not playable.<br/><br/>The major issues the author would have to address are:<br/>1)What are all the other players doing? Do they interact at all, or is the game simply a round-robin of disconnected vignettes?<br/><br/>2)Putting success dice into karma creates a highly undesirably positive feedback loop. Someone who has a lot of successes is rewarded by being even more able to succeed in the future. And someone who rolls poorly and gets few successes is punished by being neutered in the next cycle, which is very worrisome.<br/><br/>3)The economy of dice doesnâ€™t function well. With the current rules, a player should probably always roll all of his dice in order to maximize the chances of a success, and in order to maximize the number of dice that flow into Karma.<br/><br/>4)This game is going to go on a LONG time. Each player gets 5 scenes per life cycle, and a minimum of 4 life cycles. With the way Karma currently works, one could easily extend this out past 8 life cycles. Even with that aspect fixed, however, 20 scenes per player seems like way too long.<br/><br/>5)Souls are likely to burn out at completely different times, meaning that a play group will have to deal with people being eliminated from a game that is still ongoing.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite><br/><br/>Without meaning to argue with your review, I do want to note that the circles are used in the game -- you must occupy a circle to achieve the win condition.</blockquote>
No worries, William. I love the concept of Guardian Angels. I hope you work on it more!<br/><br/>I should make it clear now for the review: Yes, the circles are used and are important for the game. However, if you look at those circles on the character sheet, they have lines coming off of them into white space. It is those lines that generated my original statement. Try a visual exercise. Look at the character sheet and imagine those extra lines are not there. Mentally erase them. Without them, the game is a good match for the sheet. It's complete with no loose ends. With those extra lines...it looks like something is missing, both from the sheet, and the game. It's a road, a path, a direction without end, and it seems to me it should have been used in some fashion.                        </div>

This review is as objective as I can make it; it just happens to be a very well-developed game.<br/><br/><b>Premise:</b><br/>In this two-player game, one player controls an Architect from Atlantis who travels through time to warn coming civilizations of their impending apocalypse.<br/><br/><b>Playability: 9</b><br/>The 18-page ruleset clearly lays out all of the rules, including the division of authority, situation creation, resolution, and character development.  There might be some kinks in there that will require playtesting, but at first and second glance, all of the rules are there and seem to work together well.  Several rule ideas are really cool, such as the interplay between life-time (how much time the character has until the apocalypse hits) and insight (whether the character manages to stop the apocalypse), and how those bring up tactical decisions with the dice mechanic.  The basic dice mechanic is also very cool, but explaining it would take too long at this point.  It remains to be seen how it plays out.  One of the concerns I have is that the characters are going to burn out permanently rather quickly.  <br/><br/><b>Sheet Integration: 9</b><br/>Adam used all of the parts of the sheet in several different ways in the game.  The only one that seems to be missing is Life-Times Achieved (correct me if Iâ€™m wrong, Adam).  Even small items such as Liege are given in-depth treatment.<br/><br/><b>Coolness Factor: 7</b><br/>While the idea is great, it reminded me a bit of the Group Design Challenge premise at the Forge from a while back.  Also, as Adam admits, there are obvious <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> influences here that helped Adam with the design, but make for a less-than-perfect fit.  Iâ€™m just not sure that the way static traits are used gels well with the overall gameâ€”it feels like the way they are added up to get the four different arenas of conflict (among which you can escalate) are a leftover from the source of inspiration and feel somewhat forced (why use spirit+connection to kill someone when you use spirit+flesh to hurt them?).  Still, overall the game looks great and Iâ€™d definitely play it.  It has a lot of cool Color, too, such as the way in which Adam incorporated the Liege element from the sheet.  The amount of effort and coolness that went into this game are overwhelming to someone like me who barely squeezed out three pages.  Also, the layout is well done, art is included, and it overall looks highly polished already.<br/><br/><b>Total Score: 25</b> </div>

<b>The Kings Court</b><br/>
Game: Jason Dettman<br/>
Sheet: DJ Changon<br/>
<br/>
This looks like a nice game, too, but first of all, DJ and Jason, the Latin name of that big planet is "Iuppiter". "Iovis" is the genitive and "Iovus" has no meaning at all. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
The game takes place in a medieval kingdom. One of the players takes the role of the Yankee who is placed there after an accidental time travel. The other players take the roles of King, Bishop, Natural Philospher, Courtier or Castellan. All characters are pregenerated with stats and motivations, like:<br/>
<br/>
- The Bishop wants to burn all witches and the Yanke probably is one.<br/>
- The Natural Philosopher wants to learn about the universe and the Yankee probably knows something.<br/>
<br/>
Except for the King who is supposed to be kind of a moderator all characters have exclusive control over some part of the fiction (Bishop &gt; Church, Yankee &gt; Future,...). If you don't like some other statement made by player you can dispute it, by setting a token. If the other player insists he sets a token, too, dice are rolled and the winner takes both tokens.<br/>
<br/>
If a player acquires more tokens then all other players, he has won and can describe the fate of Yankee and kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Playability 6/10</b><br/>
The play starts with the King ordering the captured Yankee to be brought in. The players then engage in a discussion. In the text all statements and disputes are in-character. Can there be OOC statements, too? Can the play move out of the throne hall?<br/>
<br/>
<b> Integration of the Character Sheet 3/10</b><br/>
Frankly, I must say: The game would be better without the character sheet. Although all the named stats were used the graphic and the lines at the sides were not.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Wow, thatâ€™s cool 9/10</b><br/>
Conquer the Horizon is cool and underground. Borrowing from CtH is therefore somewhat cool. Time travelling in a Delorian is probably cool. Games where you can start medias in res are definitely cool. Making nice games from bad Hollywood films is cool as the outmost circle of hell.                        </div>

                            Game: <b>The Best Thing</b><br>Designer: Mark Vallianatos<br>Sheet: Stefan Koch<br><br/><b>Playability: 4</b><br/>This game seem to be a bit slow in play, and seems to be a bit lacking in the interaction department. Fiddling about with a hoard of dice is not my favourite pasttime...<br/><br/><b>Sheet Integration: 10</b><br/>The game is built on the sheet, with both care and innovation. The designer is using various parts of the sheet to make general design of great value: the "circle of sickness" and the "pyramid of influence" are two noteworthy design features. The pyramid of influence is instantly applicable to almost any roleplaying game I know of.<br/><br/>There is of course the small issue of reorienting the elemental-circle to suit the other circles, but after careful consideration I could not stop myself from giving a 10er for sheet integration.<br/><br/><b>Coolness Factor: 7</b><br/>I find it very cool that the players are to be: "healers and scholars, perhaps charlatans..." is this game! This initial statement, together with the rest of the intro and the description of what the game is about, make my expectations of the game soar.<br/><br/>However: it plummets a bit when the intro ends with stating that to play the game I'll need "20 or 30 6-sided dice...". It plummets a bit more when reading about the mechanics. Too much details and steps and dices, and too little support of interaction. That's not cool.<br/><br/><b>Total Score: 21</b><br/><br/>- I'd like to see this game fulfill the intitial promise, and to support more gameplay along the lines of the first scene; where the charlatans are discussing the maladies of the emperor. Why is there virtually no chance in this game, of all the charlatans gathering around the sickbed of the emperor, quarreling about how to treat the multiple maladies!? I'd like to se the game developed towards more freely spun and nicely supported interaction!<br/><br/>- I'm really impressed with the way Mark has built his game around the sheet. Some of the design elements unearthed in this process show the great value of this challenge! It show the old wisdom of using restraints to strenghten creativity to be effective once more. It's great to see genius grow from circumstance!                        </br></br></br></div>

Chagnon, but that's not your fault; it's mis-credited on Kevin's page.  (Only this time, though - he gets it right for my actual game submission.)
<blockquote><br/>This looks like a nice game, too, but first of all, DJ and Jason, the Latin name of that big planet is "Iuppiter". "Iovis" is the genitive and "Iovus" has no meaning at all. ;o)<br/></blockquote>
The latin name is, indeed, Iuppiter; no argument there.  The Cellarius plate that the sheet is based off of (<a href="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~vgent/cellarius/images/hm/hm_08.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for the curious) referred to that particular body as the "Stella Iovis," and that still showed on the sheet, and Iuppiter didn't really fit, so I went with the genitive anyhow.  *shrug*  Can't really explain why; probably sleep deprivation at the time.  I've got no idea where Jason got the "u" from.  (J, do we blame Britt, or did you not have her proofread it? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>(OK, so mainly that was an excuse to post a link to the original plate.  I think that collection of plates is stunning, and has a lot of potential to inspire.)                        </div>

The living may dream there way here. The dead wander here as spirits. The game works only for a number of players that evenly divides 12 (that is, 2, 3, 4, or 6 players).<br/><br/><b>Overall Playability: 3</b> <br/>I had a hard time understanding how to play this game. The thick terminology (e.g., "leading the processional," which seems to mean being the GM) does contribute to my fog. This fog is perfect for evoking a crazy dreamlike, half-dead reverie, but it's lousy at teaching me how to play the game. I had to read it several times to have a clue what a player should be doing at any given time.<br/><br/>Resolution is bizarre. At the time of character creation, everyone chooses one of the hours of the clock (and these are governed by different "correspondences" like deception, reason, or emotion). During play, whenever a situation reaches a conflict, a player rolls a d12 and whoever owns that hour gets to decide what happens. That's it. This falls flat for me. It's extremely simple but I think it ought to draw from the other choices the player made in character generation.<br/><br/>Most importantly, I cannot see a reward mechanism here. It seems that once you write down your character, you never change it. The character may grow within the fiction but this is not reflected on the sheet. The game seems to be an exercise of telling stories and rolling dice to see what happens. There seems to be some drive for players to make a point of some kind but where's the payoff for doing so?<br/><br/><b>Integration of the Sheet: 6</b> <br/>In one sense, the sheet is painfully simple: a freaky picture with a couple white "rubbed out" spots to answer five questions: <i>Who are you? Who am I? What do you taste like? What times does the clock tick? Are you Dead or are you Sleeping?</i> In another sense, the sheet suggests a lot about the thematic material of the game. It has tentacle-like wisps of white reaching up from the darkness. Someone's skeletal remains lie in a pile on the ground. There are ominous black shadows. The text is hard to read, perhaps somewhat intentionally.<br/><br/>Thom did cover all the aspects of this sheet in his game. He uses each question to guide the mechanics of the game. He "cheats" in a fantastic and creative way, too, by using the sheet as just part of a Character Folio — a package of pages that describe a character and his relationship to all the other characters. I struggled with how to judge this category given that Thom used all of the provided sheet but could not build a complete game without expanding it. In the end, I decided that he had integrated the sheet very well but could not have reverse-engineered the game that Kirk envisioned (if he envisioned any!), so I deducted 2 points here.<br/><br/>From my reading, however, <i>Etherium Clock</i>'s use of the five questions is mostly color. It's <i>cool</i> color, but it's just color, and it isn't really magnifying the mechanics. I think of color as a multiplier for the rest of the elements of exploration in an RPG. In some games, the color is a x10 or x100 multiplier and that's awesome. In other games, the color is a x1 multiplier and it doesn't really add anything to game play. I think Thom's use of color here is a small multiplier and it missed a huge opportunity. The player makes choices that will have some impact to the fiction if the players use it to full effect, but there's nothing mechanical to make it pop. Only <i>What times does the clock tick?</i> gets the full game design treatment. I'd like to see a player's choice of Dead or Asleep <br/><br/><b>General Coolness: 4</b><br/>Jung and Plato? Dream walking? Restless spirits? Hidden truths? Dream interpretation? This has all the makings of a fantastic game. In the end though, I judge on how cool <i>playing the game</i> will be, in my estimation and I don't think it will deliver without some serious development.<br/><br/>I do like how the players can impeach the GM and pick a new one, though it isn't clear what exactly happens if this is done in the middle of a resolution or at some other inopportune time.<br/><br/><b>Comments:</b><br/>I don't particularly like that a player relinquishes rights to add Taboos after the game has started. I also dislike that each player only gets one. The idea of Taboos is a "lines and veils" thing. It's there to make the players feel safe. Essentially, by playing Taboo, you are saying that only one topic is off limits and everything else is up for discussion. If you don't want child abuse in your game, you'll have to allow bestiality and torture in, and if, halfway through the game, you remember that you're afraid of touching raw cheese more than anything else, you have no recourse. You'd be <i>out of line</i> to try to make it a Taboo.<br/><br/>I think Thom missed an opportunity with the "clock" aspect of the sheet. While he does use the "ticks" within his mechanics, I had hoped for some kind of time progression. I'm not scoring down for that though.<br/><br/><b>Total Score: 13</b> </div>

<b>Game:</b> <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/FateClockTomas%20HV%20M%c3%b8rkrid.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FateClock</a><br/><b>Designer:</b> Tomas HV Mørkrid<br/><b>Sheet:</b> <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Megueybaker.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meguey Baker</a><br/><br/><b>The Game:</b><br/><i>FateClock</i> explores "ideas of leadership, history, conflict, and humanity" and threatens to "make history more interesting than it ever was." Please, no! (just kidding!) <br/><br/>The players take on roles of powerful godlike entities (the "riders") who visit various periods in time, possess people there (the "ridden"), and have their way with them. The purpose of these characters is to experience their lives. The purpose of the players is to toy with history. The game encourages players to throw real history aside and use it only as a jumping point for playing a wild game of "what if?" Having just written a game where magical beings travel through time, possessing people there, in order to rewrite history, I have to say I'm enamoured of the concept. <br/><br/><b>Overall Playability: 7</b> <br/>The character generation rules look solid enough but the drawing and assigning of cards for Rider/Ridden should be explained in the earlier section, not in the conflict resolution section; that was very confusing.  <br/><br/>Conflict resolution is simple and elegant. You draw a card at random, add the total single-card value of your Rider or Ridden (or both, if they apply), and add  your Fate Burden, which starts at -9. It's player-vs-player, so one of the other players does the same thing. The player with the highest result wins and narrates whatever he or she likes. The rules do not give much guidance on what is fair and unfair narration or how it has to tie in with the original conflict situation but it's assumed that the winner just narrates how he gets what he wanted in the first place, before another player opposed his action. A player can receive aid from another player; this lets the player draw an additional card but none of the aider's traits help.<br/><br/>As you complete conflicts, your Fate Burden changes if your opponent deems it so. It slowly slides from -9 towards 0 and when you reach 0 you are overcome with evil and the world ends if two players signify that desire by crossing their arms. I totally do not understand why an opponent would ever "award" a Fate Burden shift (it's 1 or 2 points each time) since this makes one's opponents more powerful (less Fate Burden) and also brings the end of the game closer.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the game is pretty playable though I have doubts about the reward system.<br/><br/><b>Integration of the Sheet: 7</b><br/>My first test for this category is one of expectation. I read the game rules then look at the sheet. Is the sheet what I expected? In this case, it is not. Did Tomas create a cool game from Meg's sheet? You bet. Did he do a good job of reverse engineering the sheet? Not really. He does an okay job and he uses most or all of the sheet's aspects.<br/><br/>Here's a deeper look at Meg's sheet. 
<ol><li> It has four unfinished statements at the top: <i>I am... I feel... I see... I want...</i> </li><li> At the bottom is the unfinished statement, <i>____ knows my name.</i> </li><li> The main part of the sheet contains twelve boxes situated around... </li><li> a lavender oval "Fate Clock" disc.  </li><li> These twelve boxes each have a line off to one side for writing something.  </li><li> The left six are under the banner, "Rider," and the right six are under the banner, "Ridden."  </li><li> The left side is in a slightly lighter color than the right. This seems an intentional mechanical, not artistic, choice.</li><li> Also, most peculiar is the way the boxes are half bisected diagonally. </li><li> Over the Fate Clock is a 10-pointed star. This is probably just an artistic flair. </li><li> The upper right corner contains three concentric circles arranged like gears within gears or some conjunction of planets. Could be a logo. Doesn't look like it's mechanically-oriented.</li></ol>
Tomas' rules use most of the sheet. The players fill in the statements (#1) as expected. They choose a player who knows their true evil nature (#2). The 12 boxes get filled in with card values (#3) and the Fate Burden gets written inside the Fate Clock disc (#4). The players writes names of Rider/Ridden on the lines by the boxes (#5, #6).  <br/><br/>The "clock nature" of the 12 boxes around the Fate Clock is not exploited. The fact that the left side is darker than the right isn't used (#7), nor is the funny line inside the boxes (#8).  I would hope to see the artistic flair of the 10-pointed star and the "logo" of three concentric circles appear within the thematic content somehow, but they do not.  I see missed opportunities here.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the game does a better than average job of integrating the sheet.<br/><br/><b>General Coolness: 5</b><br/>I'm a sucker for time-traveling history-making games. The idea of this godlike creature toying with history sounds like a great deal of fun. But the "cool" is in the play. Without a reward mechanism, this just seems like a toy, not a game, and it falls flat for me.<br/><br/><b>Comments:</b><br/>The little punch-out boxes with designer notes are jarring. The tone of the writing within them is jovial and irreverent and self-mocking. It doesn't fit my expectations after the declaration of such a strong theme of rewriting history, only more interesting. The designer notes are apologetic at times and tell me not to take the content seriously. I think this detracts from the game as a whole. I'd get rid of these. A couple of the notes contained real play advice. Move these into the main text and lose the attitude. I almost scored down a point for this but in the end decided it was a cosmetic concern that didn't make the game any less cool.<br/><br/><b>Total Score: 19</b> </div>

                            Bullseye<br>Game: Judson Lester<br>Sheet: Jason Sims<br/><br/>Bullseye is a fascinating game: it uses the whole "chase genre", which I love. And it's an experiment in some very interesting mechanics: defining characters gradually over the course of the game; letting other players reward characterisations that interest them; GM-less stuff. <br/><br/>What I'm unsure of, though, is whether these mechanics will produce a good story. It's another game where I'd rather give a "potential" mark than a "playability" mark.<br/><br/>And, by the way, I feel slightly shitty about posting this review. Bullseye has got a rave review above so, by scoring it slightly lower, I may well take down the average score. But I'm working on the principle that it's better to post a review than no review, so here we go.<br/><br/>1. Playability 5<br/><br/>The mechanics have real potential, and they're fascinating, but I'm not sure they'll make a good story.<br/><br/>Firstly, the "reaching out" phase. There's six flags, which you persuade other players to give to you, by telling them a plan to accomplish something (I'm paraphrasing). Now, I like the idea of other players rewarding you for your narration, but how would it play? I'm seeing something like this:<br/><br/>Player 1: [Hands flag to Player 2] "I call my ex-wife, break down in tears as I protest my innocence."<br/>Player 2: [Puts flag on "Loved ones"] "Works for me."<br/>Player 4: [Hands flag to Player 1] "I hack into the Police computer, try to find the evidence that paints me as the murderer."<br/>Player 1: [Puts flag on "Friends"] "OK, let's put that on Friends: you find some of the police think you're innocent."<br/>Player 3: [Hands flag to Player 2] "I phone my brother, get him to come and rescue me."<br/>Player 2: [Puts flag back on table] "Yeah, I'm not buying that."<br/><br/>...and, if we repeat that twice more, we get to the end of the reaching out phase. But I'm worried that it's just disparate bits, often of different stories: I'm not sure it'll come together to form a narrative.<br/><br/>Then we roll the dice. Those dice become a Fortune-In-The-Beginning thing (almost Bacchanal-style), in that you roll the dice, find out the result and then roleplay a scene based on the result, fleshing out the character a bit more as you do so. <br/><br/>This is kind of cool, actually: whoever is the target that round gets to flesh out their character a bit more, by playing scenes to do with their character's friends, relatives, loved ones, possessions, etc, etc.<br/><br/>And, as I understand it, that's the game. There's Reaching Out sections, where each character tries things and succeeds or fails, and the Shooter phase, where we flesh out the characters.<br/><br/>It's rather cool, and I love the fact that we're defining the characters as we go along, using scenes about people connected with them. I think it'd probably play OK (hence the "5" score). But I'm not 100% sure it's going to make for a great story, unless there's some very good roleplayers who know who to make all those scenes fit together.<br/><br/>As usual, stop me if I misunderstood anything.<br/><br/>2. Use of character sheet 10<br/><br/>Hard to fault this, really. It's a gorgeous sheet. It's used really well: not only does Judson use every bit of the sheet, in a way which makes a coherent game, but he uses very cool things like putting Evidence Flags on the bullseye. It's great.<br/><br/>3. Wow, That's Cool 7<br/><br/>It's an experimental game and I think that's what competitions like this should be about. Specifically, it's experimenting with a GM-less structure where players reward each other for good narration; and it's got some interesting Fortune-At-The-Beginning stuff in it. So that's great.<br/><br/>As it stands at the moment, I'm not champing at the bit, desperate to play this game. I love the chase genre, but I'd like a chase story to be fast-paced and exciting, with the chasee alone against the world. This game has several people being chased and it's often seen through the eyes of the people who the chasee left behind. I'm not so into that.<br/><br/>But it's a cool game, with cool mechanics, and hence the high "cool" score. By the way, I'm fascinated by the mechanics, so if Judson or anyone wants to start a thread and talk about them, I'd be interested. Especially if I've misunderstood them.<br/><br/>Total: 22<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></div>

                            Since I'm the last one on the list, the games I was responsible for started at the top:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/DarbysHeroesBRENTWOLKE.pdf" rel="nofollow">Darby's Heroes</a>.  By Brent Wolke, based on a <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/marknau.pdf" rel="nofollow">character sheet</a> by Mark Nau<br/><br/>Playability of the Game:  3<br/>Integration of Character Sheet:  9<br/>General Cool Factor:  5<br/><br/>Overall Score:  17<br/><br/>In general, I felt this was a fine beginning for a game.  Its strength lay in its unique premise, one nicely (and obviously) inspired by Mark Nau's sheet.  Unfortunately, the premise didn't particularly grab me, and while there were many many hooks in the game for examples of character traits and adventure seeds, none of those particularly grabbed me, either.  Nothing that took hold and made me say, "Wow!"  If, however, I meet someone keen on the fair folk and WWII, I know what to hand them for inspiration.<br/><br/>The mechanics seemed too sparse, and the mechanics that were there seemed as if they would get in the way of play rather than facilitating play.  The most obvious lack was for anything defining a 'scene'.  Making sure a scene wasn't too long and wasn't too short was left entirely to GM fiat, and with something so critical to game balance, I would have liked to see something more structured.  The second obvious problem in the rules was a 'death spiral':  losing one conflict makes you less likely to be able to handle the next conflict--for the duration of the adventure.  The final problem I saw was:  what do you do in case of ties?  In conflicts with small numbers of dice, it seems that ties will occur often, but no resolution mechanic is presented.<br/><br/>The most interesting mechanics were for the 'White Scenes' and 'Black Scenes'.  Again, the rules were a bit sparse, and I'm not totally convinced they would work as-written, but I felt this was the area most ripe for innovation.<br/><br/>Playtesting would immediately bring these problems to light (if I'm right about them being problems) and would perhaps suggest improvements.  These games were, after all, written in two weeks, so playtesting was unlikely.  But should Brent decide to expand the game afterwards, playtesting would obviously be crucial.<br/><br/>The sheet was both integrated well, and suggest the theme Brent used for his game in a surprising but obvious-in-retrospect way, which was pleasing.  As far as the more-subjective 'cool' factor, the fact that it didn't grab me but seemed competent led me to give it an average rating here.<br/><br/>[And now having read Brent's own playtest review of his game after having written the above, it seems he agrees that the game isn't quite playable as written.  But he has ideas for fixes, so that's great!  Here's to better mechanics down the pike.]                        </div>

<a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/specimenfortheresurrectionPaul.pdf" rel="nofollow">Specimen for the Resurrection</a>:  <br/>Paul Czege, based on Selene Tan's <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/selene%20tan.pdf" rel="nofollow">sheet</a><br/><br/>Playability of the Game:  7<br/>Integration of Character Sheet:  7<br/>General Cool Factor:  3<br/>Overall Score:  17<br/><br/>So, first off:  this is clearly not my kind of game.  The basic premise is that you tell each other horrible stories about a dystopian future, which does not sound at all appealing to me.  I'm going to try to shuffle all my subjective opinions about the game into the 'general cool factor', on the theory that I'm judging subjective coolness, not objective coolness.  It gets some 'respect' points from me here, but I don't feel that I can give a high rating here to something I find fundamentally unappealing.  But hey!  Hopefully I won't be only one of two people rating the game, and it'll find its audience somewhere else.<br/><br/>The game did seem basically playable.  One dominating factor of the mechanics is that they push for two clear 'optimal' strategies:  if you want to play as an optimist, you max 'Penance' and 'Passion', pushing points into 'Identity' when they fail.  If you want to play as a pessimist, your strategy is less clear, but maxing 'Sin' and 'Facade' seem reasonable, perhaps pushing a few points into 'Penance' or 'Passion' as the game nears its end.  For a slightly more mechanically interesting game, having people start with the same number of points (2 or 3?) in each of the five slots might be the way to go.<br/><br/>It also seemed dreadfully easy to 'game' your final influence over the alien verdict, since you write what you claim is what you want after you know whether or not the aliens will go with or against that purported desire.  So, if you have more Illusions than Histories, you apply a little bit of reverse psychology and you're good to go.<br/><br/>Maybe this would end up with an interesting story anyway if the 'point' of the game is more narrativist than (ahem) gamist.  But I better appreciate games where character desires are congruent to player desires, so as the player games the system as best he can, the character is likewise 'gaming' their reality to produce their own desired outcomes.<br/><br/>The character sheet was fairly well integrated into the game:  all the named components have a role to play in the game itself.  The arrows on the sheet (and since when do character sheets have arrows?  This contest seemed to have a surfeit of them, but I don't ever remember seeing an arrow on a sheet before) were incorporated decently with the 'shift points around' mechanic.  (It would probably be easier to play this game with stones instead of written numbers.  And I'm not just saying that because I used stones you move around in my own game; I think there's probably too much erasing in the game as it stands.)  One aspect of the sheet wasn't used at all (the relative sizes of the circles), and I didn't quite buy the 'I did' sentences in the unlabeled circles.  This was partially because these and other lines get filled in after the game is done instead of before the game begins or organically during play.  I do like the general idea of having parts you fill in afterwards (I've never seen it before, myself), but I felt the game relied a bit too heavily on it.<br/><br/>In general, I felt that if someone took only the game and made a character sheet from it, it would look a bit like Selene's sheet, but not quite.<br/><br/>So, upshot:  the basic premise didn't appeal to me, but it seemed the game could be played by those who were engaged by it--but they'd get more out of it if they ignored the obvious strategies and instead immersed themselves in their characters.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/ARCHandbookFinalDAVIDWENDT.pdf" rel="nofollow">Artifact Retrieval Corps</a><br/>David Wendt, from <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/mikewormley.pdf" rel="nofollow">sheet </a>by Mike Wormley<br/><br/>Playability of the Game:  7<br/>Integration of Character Sheet:  7<br/>General Cool Factor:  6<br/>Overall Score:  20<br/><br/>OK, so there was a *ton* of stuff on this sheet, and Mike's gone to heroic efforts to incorporate it all.  This was quite constraining for a two-week design cycle, but we have to judge these things based on the whole package, so there you go.<br/><br/>The overall game definitely has potential.  The setting has a handful of loosely-allied aliens (not so many as to become indistinguishable; not so few as to feel sparse), mysterious  bad guys, and a military-esque setting that's perfect for sending a mismatched group of heroes out on missions.<br/><br/>The rules still need work, though the core seems decent.  There were a few times when I felt David externalized his own lack of inspiration about some aspect of the sheet by making ambiguity official:  the definition (or lack thereof) for what 'Spirit' means is a good example ('everything else').  And when he says, "Fill in your Mind, Body, and Spirit now.  Don't worry too much about the specifics." or that you get "as many [pips] as you need to fit your vision of your character." it seems to me to mean, "I don't have any idea how game balance is achieved because I didn't have time to play-test this monster, so you're on your own."  The rest of the game was too crunchy (I felt) to justify this lackadaisical attitude towards assigning basic competency.<br/><br/>The sheet was meticulously integrated, but in the end it felt a bit more mechanical than organic, as if sections of the rules were there for the express purpose of providing a rule for a section of the sheet, rather than the other way 'round.<br/><br/>I liked the game idea in general, but I felt I would have liked it more if David had gone ahead and aggressively pursued some of the ideas therein instead of leaving important bits and pieces up to the players.  Tell us when and how we can assign stats and tell us what the setting is.  None of this 'here's some setting but, you know, take it or leave it'.  The setting was good, if a little sparse--no need to apologize for it.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/fatalism.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fatalism</a><br/>Fred Lenza, from <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/matthijs%20holtersheet%20only.pdf" rel="nofollow">sheet</a> by Matthijs Holter<br/><br/>Playability of the Game:  4<br/>Integration of Character Sheet:  8<br/>General Cool Factor:  5<br/>Overall Score:  17<br/><br/>Fatalism is 'Final Destination:  The RPG', played competitively.  I'm not entirely sure it would work, but it's a fun take on a very minimalist sheet. <br/><br/>The reason I'm not sure it would work is the combination of competitiveness with a lack of 'crunch' to referee the competition (and no GM to referee, either).  This is a bigger issue in this particular game, too, because the genre it emulates is based on a series of Rube Goldberg-esque improbable events.  I can envision arguments that would either break out or be suppressed 'for the good of the game' about whether a character had indeed taken adequate measures to prepare themselves against the crazy death-trap that just blew up.  Since there's no in-game mechanism to resolve these disputes, it falls back to the group itself to resolve things, and that worries me.  The fun of the game seems to be the thinking up of crazy death-traps by one player, and their clever avoidance by another.  Being clever is where the enjoyment lies.  But resolution comes down to 'who was more clever', and suddenly there's a potential for conflict that wasn't there before.  In my ComedySportz improv days, there was a great built-in mechanism for resolving these types of disputes:  the audience would vote.  They're impartial; the points don't matter; everybody goes home happy.  The built-in mechanism for resolving these types of disputes in a RPG is usually dice, which are also impartial, and again the points don't matter in the end.  But here it's just straight cleverness vs. cleverness, and things just... play out, I guess.  So I would have preferred some sort of built-in neutral arbitration so that everyone could get on with just being creative without worrying about being creative enough. <br/><br/>Now, Fred might be aware of this and not care--the person who goes first is explicitly the person whose opening story everyone likes the least, after all, which is the same sort of thing.  But I didn't like the method of choosing who goes first, either, so at least we're both consistent.<br/><br/>The good news is that I believe something appropriate could be added fairly seamlessly, making this a more inherently functional game.  IMO, of course. <br/><br/>As far as sheet integration... well, there were a grand total of two elements on the sheet, and Fred's used them both.  He seems to require that you print it on something transparent, which is a bit weird but I can live with, and you have to extend the beginning of the arrow to the corner of the sheet, which is fine but not perfect in terms of the contest (though it does make for a better game).  But he did use the fact that it is a sheet of paper for what looks like an interesting sub-game of sheet placement and connections.  So overall very good, but not perfect.<br/><br/>The cool factor?  Here's where I get to be arbitrary and bring in my personal preferences, so I'll reveal that I'm not a big horror movie fan, and though I haven't seen the Final Destination movies, the previews and the premise seemed kinda dumb.  I'm also not a big fan of player-vs-player RPG conflict (or at least not in the form presented here).  But Fred's writing made the game seem at least intriguing if not highly compelling even to a non-fan like me, so I have to give him props for that.                        </div>

                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Adam Dray&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;b&gt;Game:&lt;/b&gt;Etherium I don't particularly like that a player relinquishes rights to add Taboos after the game has started. I also dislike that each player only gets one. The idea of Taboos is a "lines and veils" thing. It's there to make the players feel safe. Essentially, by playing Taboo, you are saying that only one topic is off limits and everything else is up for discussion. If you don't want child abuse in your game, you'll have to allow bestiality and torture in, and if, halfway through the game, you remember that you're afraid of touching raw cheese more than anything else, you have no recourse. You'd be&lt;i&gt;out of line&lt;/i&gt;to try to make it a Taboo.<br/>
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First of all, thanks for the feedback.  The whole "lines and veils" thing is similar to the Taboo system I included in Etherium (not Etherium Clock, that's the name of one of the sheets for tracking data in the Folio, but I know it was labeled as Etherium Clock when Kevin put it up, and it wasn't a big deal considering the work load he had at the time), but not having sup'd at the teat of Ron Edwards' ideas before joining this forum and then just to review an overview of GNS and compare it in general to my ideas about gaming. My first exposure to "lines and veils" came about a week ago when I read Utopolis by Eric Boyd, which was based on my character sheet entry.  I went:  "wow, that's a lot like my Taboo concept that I've toyed around with in groups since the early '90s".  I used to give long character surveys to get a grip on what political and social views the players were comfortable with, and to see any hot buttons.  Since the character sheet for this game was a type of survey, I chose to limit taboos to one per player, since all the players are capable of leading the game and have a lot of control beyond the initial taboo portion of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I do appreciate the feedback.  And I will flesh out the game to hopefully decrypt what it means for the general public.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

<b>Title Goes Here</b> by <i>Mendel Schiedekamp</i> based on a sheet by <i>Claire Bickell</i><br><br><b>Overview</b><br><br>Title Goes Here is a game of retelling stories, in it players take up a trinity of roles regarding characters from a pre-existing story (Great Work in the lingo used in the game). These roles are Scholar, an in-game role sitting in a position above the story and character, Character, an in-game role actually taking part in the story and Truth, in which they are speaking as themselves about what they want to happen in the game. Play proceeds by interpreting symbols (constellations) into a series of narratives and views and then when all the symbols have been used and all players have reached the end, tracking back through the symbols to work out the final story. The players shift between roles by rotating the (3D, folded) character sheet into one of three positions.<br><br><b>Playability</b> 4<br><br>Title Goes Here has clearly been carefully designed, in that the designer has thought about the rules and identified and solved potential problems (as in, for example, the Gnosis rule) but I don't really see how it's going to produce consistently enjoyable play. The rules are very loose, layering a thin slice of structure over freeform (but interactive) story-telling; it's not clear to me how the Great Work is intended to be used to drive play. Although the rules state that they will set the tone and influences everything there appears to be nothing in the actual mechanics that reference it.<br/><br/><b>Use of Character Sheet</b> 5<br/><br/>The use of constellations is clearly drawn from the character sheet, and the symbols given will fit easily in the spaces; while the name and summary text fit neatly enough. However, the three dark lines at the top are unused and the folding pattern in the text is clearly different from that given on the sheet (which has one less fold, and indicates the three coloured sections being folded so that they lie on top of one another). Finally, while the idea of three roles comes from the sheet, I don't see that the way Introspect, Inspect and Aspect are used in the game interlinks with the roles given.<br/><br/><b>Wow, That's Cool</b> 4<br/><br/>This game just doesn't grab me. The concept doesn't excite me, and the notion of the rounds of narration and return to telling the true path seems simply odd. While some things, such as the three dimensional sheet and multiple roles are neat in principle but the way they are used in game doesn't provide anything obvious to interest me.<br/><br/>Total Score: <b>13</b> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<b>Utopolis: Policing the Retrofuture</b> by <i>Eric J. Boyd</i>, sheet by <i>Kevin Allen, Jr.</i><br/><br/><b>Overview</b><br/><br/>Utopolis is an investigation game set in the future as it was imagined in the past. Players in the game play mind-wiped criminals who have Robot Buddies played by a different player; there is also a fairly traditional GM role. Utopolis is impressively complete for the time period of the competition; stretching to 21 pages and covering all the important bases. As players progress through the game they face fear/flaw tests as they attempt to reach one of two possible outs: either their character can return to normal society or they are consumed by the inner demons of their past and either suffer mental breakdown or recommit their earlier crimes.<br/><br/><b>Playability</b> 8<br/><br/>This strikes me as a very playable game, the rules deal with all important issues and seem to offer decent conflict resolution and a clear structure of play. My only real concern is that players will probably reach endgame at very different times and, thus, their characters will leave out of step with one another.<br/><br/><b>Use of Character Sheet</b> 8<br/><br/>Most of the character sheet is put to good use. Even Muse, the presence of which jars on the character sheet, was fitted neatly in to the game. Only the 'Remarks' section lets it down. On the character sheet this is clearly visually connected to the Talent, and Proficiency score but it is not used in this way in the game, being a mere comments section.<br/><br/><b>Wow, That's Cool</b> 8<br/><br/>Policing the Retrofuture? It's an excellent concept. The robot buddies played by the guy to your left, a neat twist. This is a game I'd like to play.<br/><br/>Total Score: <b>24</b> </div>

<b>Self-Less</b><br/>Playability of the game: The mechanics for spending dice that are stored within arrows is confusing. If I have three marks in an arrow, but also three dice, does my character continue to make rolls until the arrow is out of dice? What if the rolls keep on adding more dice to the arrow? Or can I not make any rolls because the arrow has all of my dice? What if Iâ€™m at three marks, but the arrow keeps on picking up my dice, foiling advancement? An acceptable quirk of probability? The section on handing dice back to the player lacked clarity, but appears sound with the exception of an effect that goes along with the CP sitting at 90 degrees to the player handing a die back. The lack of player input also bothers me. By the time the player is in a position to influence the story, their character has been subject to the most vigorous beating possible from the HP.<br/>With minor clarification, this game could be played as is. 7<br/><br/>Usefulness of the character sheet: The sheet doesnâ€™t hinder the gameâ€™s design, and the use of arrows is clever. I canâ€™t assign full points to something that â€œjustâ€ presents a framework for information, unfortunately. On second thoughtâ€¦ This is a story-telling experience that I donâ€™t have much experience with. While the sheet inspired and shaped the game, I donâ€™t see it as being integral to the play experience. 7<br/><br/>Wow, thatâ€™s cool factor: A mechanic that allows for verbally berating players, and then hugging them? Thatâ€™s right dangerous, but something that I could get behind in the right situation. Regardless of convention hall playability, this is a design choice that takes moxie with which to go through. Thatâ€™s cool. 6<br/><br/><b>20</b><br/><br/><b>Foe Destroyer</b><br/>Playability of the game: For such a cartoon-based game, the rules come off as awfully rigorous and complex. It sounds like players are only able to react to each other in the predetermined turn order. Is this correct? 4<br/><br/>Usefulness of the character sheet: Itâ€™s all there. The rules make constant reference to the sheetâ€™s dingbats, and Iâ€™d much prefer to use the official character sheet over a piece of paper. 10<br/><br/>Wow, thatâ€™s cool factor: Perhaps I have no soul, but Iâ€™m not enamored of the core concept of squabbling, heavy metal, immortal women who pilot giant robots. OK, the giant robots are pretty neat. I can see something interesting coming from the system of pip accumulation and the discomfort that comes from a player not knowing the background of his character until the end of the game. It seems harsh for the setting, however. 4  <br/><br/><b>18</b> </div>

                            Here are Fred Lenza's reviews:<br/><br/><br/>This Place<br/><br/>By: Joe J. Prince<br/><br/>My initial response to this game is uncertain. I'm not very familiar with the theater of the absurd concept that author refers to at the end. I'm also not seeing quite how the booklet is supposed to go together. Could just be elitism from an origami folder. I think I understand the order of the questions/pages to give this a fair judgement though.<br/><br/>In considering this game my take has evolved into: A group of reflections fighting for control of a person's current out look.<br/><br/>Playability: 6<br/><br/>The game has strong pure story telling aspect to it. It's uncluttered with mechanics, however I feel that the great porblem with this is that there is absolutely nothing the individual can do against the group. I also feel that if things are heavily story telling focused about survival and conspiration with other players then the dead/gone ought to have some continued input. I'm not positive on this point because it doesn't specify if those outside the conflict in a challenged statement include only those who still tell tales or not. I do like the ability to influence others from the switching of centers.<br/><br/><br/>Character sheet intergration: 7<br/><br/>It incorperates the depth created by having a booklet. As I mentioned earlier I think that the switching of centers is good use of that and allows atleast some level of influence over otehr players that would not be possible otherwise. This is a great expansion upon the sheet. I feel that while location obviously has a great effect upon the game and feel of the this place there were better ways of integrating it. It feels as though this were "tacked" on to accomodate the sheet. What I'm saying is that I felt it should have tied more directly to rest of the round. I don't know keeping the scene constant would be far too limiting. I however think it would lead to people looking for intrestign things (meta physical of, course) in intresting places.<br/><br/>Coolness: 6<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the theater of the absurd. Atleast as I understand it. I didn't feel that the use of sheet took things in directions that were unique or unexpected from the original design.

                            A correction with respect to Utopolis - the character sheet was designed by Thom Foster not Kevin. Thanks for the review, Jack. You're right that the endgame likely will be achieved for characters at different times, which could be a bug or a feature depending upon your view. I see it as a chance to rotate the cast and put the spotlight on different characters in different sessions. <br/><br/>Here's my first review:<br/><br/><b>Motes in the Eye of the Emperor</b><br/>Game by Alexander Cherry<br/>Sheet by Jeff Moore<br/><br/><b>Playability â€“ 1/10</b> <br/>The game is admitted by the designer to be incomplete. At present, the game really only allows the characters to be partially created, since abilities and their attendant duties and offices are not included. Rather than including a list of abilities, perhaps you could include rules for making them up on the fly. How to handle the resolution of scenes in play is only partially described, with gaps that make play with the current draft impossible. Itâ€™s also not clear just what the characters should be doing once they arrive at the Emperorâ€™s space station, making the conception of what form play would take problematic at this point.<br/><br/><b>Integration of the Sheet â€“ 8/10</b> <br/>The game uses the aspects of the character sheet to good effect. I really like how the protocols of the Emperor dictate which aspect must be used in a scene, although Iâ€™m not sure about the viability of a conflict not having a key aspect resulting in automatic failure. The middle four aspects donâ€™t currently have a use other than part of figuring the final aspects. Level and experience are included but vaguely defined.<br/><br/><b>Cool Factor â€“ 7/10</b> <br/>I really like the combination of ancient Chinese bureaucracy and sci-fi tropesâ€”there is fertile ground here for developing a great game. However, once the characters arrive at the space station Yi Jing Iâ€™m not clear on what theyâ€™ll end up doing or what form any adversity will take. As such, thereâ€™s no hook or grabby situation to pull me into the game at present.<br/><br/><b>Total â€“ 16/30</b> <br/>Thereâ€™s a lot to like in the game so far, but not all the ingredients have been mixed in yet and the oven hasnâ€™t been preheated. I think once youâ€™ve found the situation or hook to drive the characters forward the rest of the system will fall together on its own.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/YouGotTaBeStartinSumthin.pdf" rel="nofollow">You Got Ta Be Startin Sumthin</a><br/>Frank Manna, from <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/darcyburgess.pdf" rel="nofollow">sheet</a> by Darcy Burgess<br/><br/>Playability of the Game:  8<br/>Integration of Character Sheet:  4<br/>General Cool Factor:  10<br/>Overall Score:  22<br/><br/>OK, this is my favorite game so far.  I think the dancefights might be too random in the end for such a key mechanic, and the sheet has a lot of added stuff on it that stretches (if not breaks) the spirit of the contest itself, but it exudes style from every pore in its body, and I loved it for that.<br/><br/>The setting is dialed to a great level for a quickly-written game like this.  I felt it was pretty much the perfect blend of specifics, generalities, and bits left explicitly to the players.  Right there, that bumped the playability score considerably.  The mechanics seem like they would work, and the basic conflict resolution with dice looks fine, but the dancefight bit with cards seemed like a lot of sound and no fury.  This was disappointing, since there are so many different things you can do with cards--melds, straights, flushes, poker hands, etc., that it seemed a waste to go with the simplistic 'high card wins'.  The initial fighting for the neutral cards was inspired, and I'd definitely keep that.  But after that, simply keeping the high card isn't nearly as interesting as, say, keeping three cards and trying to assemble a poker hand, or keeping pairs, or gaining the ability to call wilds, or some other mechanism.  If you really want to keep the 'highest wins' mechanic, ditch the cards, and have the players fight for gradually-increasing dice (first bout is for d6's, second bout is for d8's, final (team) bout is for d12's).  Then you roll all the dice you've accumulated and highest wins.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't want to design Frank's game for him, but it just seemed like there was a golden opportunity for something clever that was wasted there.  Though I did, as I say, really like the face-offs being for the neutral cards.  That looked like a great way to add excitement to the conflict without dreadfully skewing the odds in the process.<br/><br/>The character sheet had a lot of extra stuff on it that wasn't there originally, and it didn't use the circle-on-circles to the left of the figure either consistently or as actual circles, but merely as places to put the stats developed for the game (and not grown organically from the sheet).  However, giving the main figure stats of 'Crown', 'Joints', and 'Soul' was absolutely inspired, and, you know, that guy looks like he may well be dancefighting.  For that, I forgave it a lot.<br/><br/>For the cool factor:  I loved the game.  I loved the premise, I loved the writing, and I loved the joy with which Frank tackled the subject.  This game isn't the ideal winner of the contest (what with the liberties it took with the sheet) but I think the final version of this game would be a blast to play.<br/><br/>I leave you with one of my favorite quotes from the game:
<blockquote>"Giant Ants, Bandits, and Demons are all considered Zombies."</blockquote> </div>

                            This is fred lenza, checking in.  I asked Zach to post stuff for me because earlier on I had a lot trouble makign sure my emails made it in, and I had no idea how quick the forum registration would go.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the review lpsmith.  The competative aspect of this game as well as the diceless nature were new arenas for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally I'm not a big on competative RPG play either.  I was curious in trying it though.  It was mainly to see if I could lay down enough ground rules for this competition of wits to be even despite oneside controling the entirety of the setting.  Looking back on it, it does seem ambitious, concerning the amount of time left myself.  I let the vote occur early on, but not during GM/player disputes because of the competative nature of the game.  There's a huge difference between deciding if one dies and who is the first at risk.  I understand the need for a conflict resolution system, but wasn't sure of the form it would take with out stats or something to make it less arbitrary.  Atleast nothing that didn't involve stuff bordering on insurance actuary skillz.  I was big on trying to keep the sheet pure.  I suppose that technically there is no spot for a name on there, but I really liked the Gestalt of a set of sheets coming together and forming the basis of the game.                        </div>

                            Well, I wasn't going to make public any of my reviews because I'm a really heavy critic, but the game's author requested this one be made public. I've also reviewed Cubit and Guardian Angles so far, if the authors of those games would like to see the reviews I wrote I can email them, and if they also decide that the reviews should be made public I'll post them too. Anyway, here we go. The review is too long on its own so I've had to split it across multiple posts:<br/><br/>Growing Pains - by Andrew Kenrick<br/><br/>Before I start, I'd just like to say that this is by far the most professionally produced and entertaining of the three games I've looked at so far. I do like this game quite a bit, so if I sound a little negative in the review that follows it's just because I'm being thorough.<br/><br/>Playability of the Game<br/>First and foremost it has to be said that Growing Pains has been put together in a neat, professional manner that is an absolute joy to read. It's simple, well-illustrated with examples (something sadly and seriously lacking in the last game I reviewed) and has at its base a concept with equal capacity for satire and serious use. The players characters are teenagers who can transform into powerful... er... things (what those things are is left up to the group, but the game has a very strong 'Power Rangers' vibe) and also have to deal with... angst. Argh. Now I hate angst in a game, but (a) this is purely a subjective view on my part and (b) it's a subject that's positively ripe for satire, so that's certainly not a points-losing situation.<br/><br/>Speaking of Angst, the concept is worked directly into the mechanics. It starts off low and, as the character succeeds at tasks and so forth, slowly creeps up. Seems a bit contrary to real life to be honest, I usually find that doing well at stuff relieves angst, but hey! This isn't meant to be real life. Anyway, your Angst level acts as the difficulty of performing future actions. The better you do at stuff, the more likely you are to fail in the future. The GM can also set an independent difficulty number if the character attempts to do something that ought to be more difficult than their current Angst level, but the difficulty is never LESS than Angst. This is an interesting concept. It encourages the players to start off with accomplishing small challenges and work their way up to the big stuff as their Angst increases. However it also means that as the game progresses they find the simplest tasks more and more difficult to accomplish. Because of Angst. It's a fascinating concept, and I can see it working from time to time. It presents the player with an interesting problem. HIGH Angst means you fail more challenges and have to take the consequences, but failing challenges reduces your Transformation and makes it easier to change into your other form (whatever that might be). LOW Angst means that challenges are easier, but you can't use your super powers until it reaches 4, and of course if you succeed at all your challenges you'll find it difficult to transform. Fortunately you can also reduce your angst by requesting an Angst scene.<br/><br/>The dice mechanics are simple enough. Nothing uber-specially-different, but that's not the point. They are quick, intuitive and fulfil their purpose. I am not entirely sold on the Angst-management aspect of the game myself, but it is at least interesting and in-theme for the subject matter.<br/><br/>One thing that I would like to see clarified is the way in which scenes are handled. While the game has a traditional GM figure (the Nemesis) it is the players who define the type of scene they want to face. This is either a Challenge (increase Angst or decrease Transformation) an Angst scene (combines healing and Angst management) or a montage (recover exhausted powers, develop new ones and/or decrease Transformation). However the game's examples and descriptions take as a case in point only one character. I am not entirely certain how the Nemesis ought to deal with a game involving multiple characters. Should they all be involved in the same scene, even if they have nothing to do with the subject? Should they each get a scene of their own in turn? Growing Pains has a very relaxed atmosphere to it, so I'm guessing that players just take part in scenes as and when they feel it appropriate, and discuss who gets their own scenes where necessary. It would be nice to get a little more guidance on this matter though, and while the examples included are easily adequate to explain most of the rules, some multiple-player examples would be nice.<br/><br/>Overall though, I'm mostly nitpicking. Growing Pains has a very neatly laid-out set of rules and I'm confident that the vast majority of gaming groups would be able to pick it up in a short space of time and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Playability: 8<br/>Overall impressions are excellent, but a little more assistance with how to run the game would be greatly appreciated. Also I'm not totally sold on the Angst mechanics, but since they are thematically appropriate and pretty well-developed I'm letting it ride.                        </div>

                            Integration of the Sheet<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned the sheet has been used pretty darn well. In all fairness it was one of the easier sheets to design a game for, but that's not part of the marking scheme. The important thing is that all of the attributes and factors on the sheet have been used in a logical and useful fashion. There are only a couple of things here that I really think could have been better incorporated into the rules. Firstly, there is a space for the player's personal nemesis and their threat level. This is incorporated into the game, but I feel that it would be better if the player didn't know their values. Secondly, and more importantly, there's Kill Count. There doesn't seem to be any mechanical reason why a player would want to keep track of the number of people he/she has killed, and in the context of the game as it stands I'd have to say "Nor should there be." However it's there on the character sheet and not incorporated into the game, so I really do have to mark down just a little for that. Overall though, again, I'm nitpicking. Very well executed.<br/><br/>Integration: 9<br/>'Kill Count' seems superfluous, and I'm not certain the players ought to know the threat level of their arch enemy or not, but otherwise very nicely accomplished.<br/><br/>General Cool Factor<br/><br/>This is my least favourite category because I never know what to put here and it seems... well... unavoidably subjective. Still, here goes. I liked the concept and the idea behind Growing Pains, but was a little disappointed that it doesn't seem to encourage in-character player interaction as much as it could. The Relationships rules are great and all, but I would have liked to see them used to emphasise and drive forward relationships between the player's characters, rather than (as it appears to be) between the player's character and a number of NPC's devised by that player. I really do think that the game would be improved considerably by encouraging, if not requiring, the players to either share certain NPC's in their relationships, or to rely more heavily on other players as their relationships. There is some provision made for this kind of interaction in the 'Affiliations' section, but I think a finer point could have been made about it. What can I say, I'm a critic. I'm also not hugely fond of the rather rigid framework that the game fits into, but that's something that I think I could work around and is certainly not as inflexible as some games I've seen in the past, so no great loss there.<br/><br/>Cool Factor: 7<br/>A neatly executed idea with plenty of scope, but a little too rigid for my liking and needs more emphasis placed upon PC-to-PC interaction I think.<br/><br/>Total Score: 24<br/><br/>Ash                        </div>

<b>Red Strings<br/>Jason Morningstar, sheet by Ashok Desai</b><br/><br/><b>Playability</b> 6/10<br/>I have this image of the cards being on a central table, and the various players coming to get cards as needed, but between pulls, they're walking around the room having secretive conversations with each other and revealing cards on the sly. That would probably work better with a few more players, though. It also messes with who is the player to your left. As written, it looks workable.<br/><br/>It could use a little more clarity in the 'character creation' phase - "choose anybody you like to be your initial agent" I understand that to mean "choose anybody you like from the web at the back of the text to be your initial agent, and decide which of the four motivations you want", but it would be helpful if the text were more explicit. I'm also not clear if I keep all face cards I draw, or only one, and that has huge impact.<br/><br/><b>Integration of sheet</b> 2/10<br/>Yeah, he didn't use the sheet. However, as far as inspiration goes, I see the connection. I give him a 2 for sheet use. I really hope someone makes a game that really uses Ashok's sheet, though, because it's cool.<br/><br/><b>Coolness</b> 8/10<br/> My initial response to this game is 'Cool!' I've been wanting an Underground Railroad game for a while, and this is as close as there's been. I love the characters available in the network. The bits of text pulled from the Richmond Dispatch are great for conveying the atmosphere of the game without bogging down the game text. I do want more, though. It's not like Jason needs another game set in a war to work on, but I'd like to see this run through the playtesting mill and get any lumps worked out.<br/><br/><b>Total</b> 16/30                        </div>

<b>The Court<br/>Troy Holaday, sheet by Aaron Casky</b><br/><br/><b>Playability</b> 8/10<br/>The game is so clearly laid out, I can't imagine it not playing well.

It's clear a lot of thought went into the process, and I like the whole secrets, rumors, truths and lies bit.

                            Here's my review of <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/CelestialSoapCHRISTIANGRIFFEN.pdf" rel="nofollow">Celestial Soap</a>, by Christian Griffen. From <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/jonathan%20walton.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jonathon Walton's</a> sheet.<br/><br/>Celestial Soap is a mash-up of traditional Chinese story-telling and traditional Soap Opera melodrama. The game is very short (4 pages) and is pitched very far towards the story-sharing end of the RPG spectrum.<br/><br/><strong>Playability Of The Game: 7 of 10</strong><br/><br/>The mechanics are concerned with which characters have which kind of relationships, and the game moves through 11 scenes detailing the trials and tribulations of a melodramatic cast of shared characters. I had a little bit of confusion about getting the game started (is there one sheet or multiple sheets? Does the host fill out all of the characters, or does each person go in turn?), but those questions were settled by later context, and would be easily solved by an editorial pass. The biggest problem is that Fearful Symmetries are noted and referenced, but I'm having a hard conceptualizing what they should be and how they should work. An example or two would be really helpful.<br/><br/>While the game is almost totally playable in it's current form, I worry that it depends almost exclusively on the group composition for it to be fun (though Christian does heavily emphasize that play should be melodramatic and fun throughout the text). To get all designer-y, I don't really see a reward cycle other than creating good entries for the ending poem's. It looks like this game would play out fairly quickly, in a series of soap-opera-esque interspersed vignettes, and (for how I like to play) would be a fun warmup or appetizer game in the style of Baron Munchhausen.<br/><br/><strong>Usefulness Of The Character Sheet: 9 of 10</strong><br/><br/>Jonathon Walton's stylish sheet is integrated extremely well. Both the graphic and typographical elements are used (for example, drawing a line over a white space means something different than doing so over the grey area of that part of the sheet). Kudo's to Christian for integrating the phrase "Dreaded Tangut-A-Go-Go" without it being awkward; the graphic to the right of the sheet also works with the flavor of the game. My only complaint is that the sheet as it currently exists doesn't really have enough room for the requisite notes made under each glyph, I think, but that's a minor complaint. I really do think this sheet was integrated extremely well.<br/><br/><strong>Wow, That's Cool Factor: 5 of 10</strong><br/><br/>While I think the "Hong Kong Soap Opera" genre is a solid fit for the sheet, it doesn't really push my buttons. I like how the game works, and the design thats there is solid, but it doesn't make me want to pick it up and play it. The poem thing is the coolest thing, to me, but I need a little bit more to get excited about a game.<br/><br/><strong>Total: 21 of 30</strong> </div>

                            Here's my review of <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/ArchitectsOfAztlanADAMDRAY.pdf" rel="nofollow">Architect's of Aztlan</a>, by Adam Dray. From <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/MikeRamseyEntry.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mike Ramsey's</a> sheet.<br/><br/>AoA is a two-player game with a rockin' premise - the player plays an immortal, time travelling spirit trying to save civilizations from utter destruction through the ages. Being an (ahem) time travel fan myself, I was happy to get this game to review.<br/><br/><strong>Playability of the Game: 9 of 10</strong><br/><br/>This game looks eminently playable. All of the parts, from backstory to character creation to situation creation to determining outcomes and consequences are there. The game is mechanically intensive enough to require some playtesting to see what ends up working and what needs to be polished - on two readthroughs, nothing jumped out at me as problematic or gamebreaking (though, seeing how the Dynamic Traits end up working would, I think, be a good focus for playtest). The only hesitation I have is about how contiguous or disjointed the game narrative should end up being. I understand that scenes can be very far apart in terms of time elapsed, but some examples or an extended example of play would be helpful in seeing how Adam sees this working out. But, at core, I don't see anything keeping me from taking the text as written and playing this game.<br/><br/><strong>Usefulness Of The Character Sheet: 8 of 10</strong><br/><br/>Other than Lifetimes Achieved, everything on the sheet is used in the game, and used well. I think the box for Gear/Essentials/Mementos is larger than it would need to be for the weight given those things in the game (while you can write as many as you want down, you only get 10 points to distribute among them, and there's 20 slots). The only other complaint I could have is that the sheet, were it reworked for the game, should be more decorated (to match the graphics in the text) and probably should have a spot to record which civilizations you've saved and which you've failed to save, as a record of play. <br/><br/><strong>Wow, That's Cool Factor: 8 of 10</strong><br/><br/>Two-player game? Time travel? Apocalyptic adventure? Intriguing premise and well-done execution? Nice layout and appropriate art? 19 freakin' pages? Nothing not to like, here. Being someone who's published a time travel game, I'm a sucker for this one. Also, the tracking of gameplay through the use of lifetimes echoes how I prefer to treat the passage of time's impact on character action in time travel games (i.e. via scenes or other mechanical bits than by passage of time in the game fiction). So that gets a big thumbs up. Sure, it needs some polishing and playtesting, but I think it's a fantastic achievement for a 2-week contest. I'd like to take this game for a spin some time.  <br/><br/><strong>Total: 25 of 30</strong> </div>

                            Here is my review of <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/CotSunCotMoonRUSSELLCOLLINS.pdf" rel="nofollow">Children Of The Sun, Children Of The Moon</a> by Russell Collins. This is the one based off <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/NathanPaoletta.pdf" rel="nofollow">my sheet</a>. W007!<br/><br/>CotS, CotM is a mythic astronomical fantasy game where you play Travelers going from starland to starland, trying to set right the evils of the universe. Each Traveler contains two sundered parts, the Sun and the Moon, but through play one of your halves can combine with the half of another character, recreating the soul of a True Traveler. If you don't fall to the evil of the darkness, of course.<br/><br/><strong>Playability Of The Game: 6 of 10</strong> <br/><br/>The mechanics seem sound, but there's definitely potential for aimless or drifting play. I'm curious as to whether the coin-flip to determine whether Sun or Moon dominates is needed, or whether that decision can be handled differently. The included sample adventure is pretty awesome, but I think it needs a little more fleshing out - as written, it's a little "rail-roady" for my taste. The other major pitfall I see is if a Traveler is overcome and removed from play - I mean, it's basically a death condition, but I would be sad if someone couldn't play anymore (see my thought at the end of this review). Given how opposition works, and the fact that you may get screwed by the coin flip, it seems fairly likely that someone will get axed in the course of play. However, I don't see any reason why you couldn't sit down and start playing this game.<br/><br/>The biggest thing this game needs is situation creation. I think that each realm could be developed in a similar manner to Towns in DitV, or something of the like, in order to give more concrete grounding to play.<br/><br/><strong>Usefulness Of The Character Sheet: 8 of 10</strong><br/><br/>I think Russell picked up on the stylizing I put into the sheet and ran like the wind with it, and it turned out awesome. Everything on the sheet is used, and used well. However, I think that there is a bit of a mismatch in how "Refreshes" is the wrong word for how they're used in the game, and "Tithe" is a little wonky to me as well. I like how they are used, though, and would rename them on the sheet to better match their mechanical usage.<br/><br/><strong>Wow, That's Cool Factor: 9 of 10</strong> <br/><br/>Ok, so I can't be objective here. 9 of 10 for coolness - I am just so damned impressed with how Russell took my sheet and made something that I really like out of it. He really adhered to the spirit of the sheet, and of the competition, and I couldn't be happier. It's like the bastard child of Polaris, DitV and Mortal Coil, and that's awesome. The only way it could be cooler is if he managed to match the layout of the text to the layout of the sheet (as I believe he wanted to do, but ran out of the time).I hope he's interested in developing it more!<br/><br/>Oh, and I think it would be awesome if, when a Traveler is overcome, they joined the Guide and got to play the characters that the Travelers are still battling against. That would be awesome.<br/><br/><strong>Total: 23 of 30</strong> </div>

                            Reviews of The Facility and Vesna Thaw.<br/><br/><b>The Facility</b><br/>Dave Cleaver â€“ (Jack Aidley)<br/><br/>Playability of the Game<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure how to grade this.  I have the feeling that there's something fairly important to the game that I just don't understand.<br/><br/>Here's one part of the game:
<pre><br/>Scenes should be framed by the GM centering around the moments in life listed on the character sheet.<br/>So the first scene is during the childhood of the mortal body. Scenes progress in order through each<br/>stage. The body dies after old-age and the next scene is framed as the childhood of the next body. Your<br/>life path marker should be used to record your progress through the stages of life.<br/></pre>
Alright, so that looks fairly straightforward, right?  I'm trying to reconcile that with this:
<pre><br/>The 'catch' is that the bodies you reincarnate into only live for one day.<br/></pre>
So how do these two facts fit together?  Are you in some sort of super-fast-aging body that compresses 72 years into 24 hours?  That's about the only thing that seems to make sense to me, but it seems so bizarre that I'm not sure the game could be about anything other than how strange that is.<br/><br/>But simply being very weird doesn't really make a game unplayble per se, in my opinion.  The mechanics look straightforward and generally playable.  So I'm going to give this section a 6.<br/><br/>Integration of the Character Sheet<br/><br/>Works out just fine.  Based on reading just the game, the sheet doesn't surprise me, which I take as a very good sign.  Nothing seems left out, forced in, or otherwise wonky.  So I'll give it a 9.<br/><br/>General Cool Factor<br/><br/>I'm going to have to mark the game down on this section, unfortunately.  It doesn't really fit what I personally want to see in an rpg.<br/><br/>What do I want?  At the most basic level, a series of important, interesting choices.  That implies that there are interesting consequences that result from the choices of the players.<br/><br/>I don't think The Facility really provides that.  Your reincarnations are disposible.  At best, they live for one day, and then you get another one.  I think it's possible to play this for laughs, the way Paranoia can, but I don't see that in The Facility.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm underestimating how much fun it'd be to play a toddler, aging with every step, running towards my dreaded enemy with a grenade in each hand.<br/><br/>What I think might have been more interesting is playing the <i>targets</i> -- those poor people who are being hunted down by reincarnating enemies.  I think it would have a feeling something like that "Fallen" movie (with Denzel Washington.)<br/><br/>So I'm going to give this a very subjective 3.  Hope that's alright, DaveC.<br/><br/><br/><b>Total: 18.</b><br/><br/>...<br/><br/><b>Vesna Thaw</b><br/>Nathan Paoletta â€“ (Martin O'leary)<br/><br/>Playability<br/><br/>This is a fairly complex game.  There's lots of fiddly bits to it.  Not necessarily unfun fiddly bits, but there's still a lot of contact.  To be fair, the character sheet also has quite a few fiddly bits, so it's not unreasonable.<br/><br/>Character generation looks like it should be fun, but I still have the faint feeling that the players might be having fun in spite of the system, rather than because of it.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 5 here.  Not necessarily a well-informed 5, but there we go.<br/><br/>Integration of the Character Sheet<br/><br/>The author had a handful with this sheet, I'm sure.  But he handled it well.  A few bits felt a bit forced, but not unforgivably so.<br/><br/>A good solid 8.<br/><br/>General Cool Factor<br/><br/>Giant Soviet robots in post-apocalyptic battles.  That spells COOL in my books.<br/><br/>However, I'm going to ding him a point here because of the terrible font.  I'm sure it was some sort of artistic design decision or whatnot, but that doesn't make my eyes feel any better.<br/><br/>Another solid 8.<br/><br/><b>Total: 21.</b><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>.1 Most intimidating sheet:  Matthijs Holter<br/><br/>.2 Crunchiest sheet:  Carl Muckenhoupt<br/><br/>.3 Most exciting:  Paul Czege<br/><br/>.4 Most likely to succeed (that is, the sheet that you felt would most easily integrate into a game, even if it didn't seem like that game would be interesting to you): Troy Holaday<br/><br/>.5 Best design in a sheet (yeah that's an aesthetic rating): Jason Morningstar<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>Bullseye is a fascinating game: it uses the whole "chase genre", which I love. And it's an experiment in some very interesting mechanics: defining characters gradually over the course of the game; letting other players reward characterisations that interest them; GM-less stuff.<br/><br/>What I'm unsure of, though, is whether these mechanics will produce a good story. It's another game where I'd rather give a "potential" mark than a "playability" mark.<br/><br/>And, by the way, I feel slightly shitty about posting this review. Bullseye has got a rave review above so, by scoring it slightly lower, I may well take down the average score. But I'm working on the principle that it's better to post a review than no review, so here we go.<br/></blockquote>
Graham, <br/><br/>Please don't feel bad about a harsh review.  Honestly, I feel like you and Fred <em>got</em> Bullseye, and that was the important thing.  I'm even more thrilled that both of you got it and rated it above average.  <em>And</em> solid feedback?  I've died and gone to heaven.<br/><br/>I have to say I was excited that you picked up the "not buying it" (puts down the flag) aspect.  I didn't want to emphasize the concept too heavily in the text, because I didn't want to imply anything about the criteria that a player would apply to that decision.  But "you're not telling a good enough story with that" would completely be a legitimate reason to put the flag back on the table.  This is the first application of my thoughts on withholding authority in a game, and I think that needs to be applied with a really light touch.<br/><br/>Thanks for posting your review!  Now it's time to get on with fulfilling my karmic debt and posting my own (hopefully not over-harsh) reviews.                        </div>

                            Bullseye is a sexy first-draft game based on a sexy premise for a sexy sheet.

<b>Shreyas Sampat â€“ (Joe McDonald )= not/guilty</b><br/><br/><b>Playability of the game: 5</b><br/>I play-tested this with a friend of mine who is a non-gamer. I want to start by saying that we both had fun playing and that I think this is a good first draft of a game that has the potential to become something very personal and evocative. In full bloom, it could be a great gateway game for non-gamers.<br/><br/>I hope the rest of this doesn't sound too negative, as I'm mainly focusing on the things that were barriers to the flow of the game for us. I think the kind of thing Shreyas was going for here is very tricky to pull off and designing a smoother version would take time and work.<br/><br/>I didn't let the bare fact that this game isn't meant to be replayed color my review of it's playability. That fact does, however, effect the playability. Essentially, every game will the first time with all fumbling first times usually include.<br/><br/>You are not meant to read ahead, and you turn to the various pages and see them for the first time as you a playing. While there was some fun in the expectation and revelation, it seemed to break the momentum of our play. Also, sometimes one player had more text and/or more complex concepts on their page and had to make the other wait as they went over things a few times.<br/><br/>I thought the writing style was appropriate for the theme, but sometimes it was so subtle that, in trying to hurry through the page as not to make the other player wait, important concepts were missed.<br/><br/>Also, there didn't seem to be anything to encourage the Doctor to ask questions and accumulate tokens (esp. since the text warns against doing so.)<br/><br/>If I hadn't actually play-tested it, I'm sure I wouldn't have been as hard on the game in this aspect.<br/><br/><b>Integration of the character sheet into the game: 9</b><br/>Not much to fault here. I think some of the elements could have been better and more naturally used, but the integration between game and sheet was almost seamless.<br/><br/><b>General cool factor: 8</b><br/>Like I said above, I think a more-developed game like this could be a lot of fun. At the end of play, my friend and I were brainstorming about the things we liked and the tweaks we would make to a game like this. It was fund and made us think.<br/><br/>The process for picking the last names of the characters (someone you don't trust, someone you've betrayed, someone who got away) was a nice, introspective personal touch.<br/><br/>Also, the style in the text fit the mood of the exercise.<br/><br/><b>Total score: 22</b> </div>

<b>Meguey Baker â€“ (Eva Schiffer)= Miss Schiffer 's School for Young Ladies of Quality</b><br/><br/><b>Playability of the game: 9</b><br/>While I wasn't able to play-test this game, I did make a character and do a few dice rolls. I didn't find anything in my reading of the game or playing with the mechanics that seemed to be a hamper to game play. I found the method of using a d6 and a world map to determine where your young lady's adventure would take place and how many conflicts she would face to be particularly fun.<br/><br/>Had I a chance to actually play-test the game, I don't know if the rating would have been this high. I just couldn't find any glaring issues that warranted a score any lower.<br/><br/><b>Integration of the character sheet into the game: 8</b><br/>I would have really loved to have given this area higher marks because of how well the concept of Meguey's game melds with the look, feel and most of the content of the sheet.<br/><br/>I thought some of the elements ("How will you show them all?" and "Mechanical Marvels" for example) didn't show up as strongly in the rules as they did on the sheet. This was especially disappointing, because I think a strong version of these aspects would have been perfect for and a lot of fun in the game.<br/><br/>Lastly, the system of how the check marks related to the spaces was counter intuitive to this non-young lady, non-scientist. I had to do some erasing and rewriting once I started simulating some ascpects of game play. That could just be my issue, though.<br/><br/><b>General cool factor: 9</b><br/>As above, I think Meguey did a great job capturing and building on the theme of the sheet. The writing style and way the game was presented were great matches in that area as well. Plus, using the sheet designer's name in the title of the game: golden.<br/><br/><b>Total score: 26</b> </div>

<p>Jason, thanks for your critique! I'd be really excited to hear your ideas for tweaks and things - I didn't have an opportunity to test the game myself, so I'm pleasantly surprised that it did somewhat work. That's possibly not material for this thread, though.</p>
<p>I'd also be interested to know which parts of the text didn't work - it was difficult balancing the amount of procedures that each person had on each page, and you saw that I did not even try, in one case. That might have been a factor in making the bits that were too subtle or condensed.</p>

<b>Empire</b><br/><br/>Game by Zach Welhouse<br/>Sheet by Christian Griffen<br/><br/><b>Playability â€“ 5/10</b> <br/>The game can be played as it currently stands, but the text doesnâ€™t provide much information on what the characters would be doing or what a session of play would actually look like. Iâ€™m concerned with the speed at which the charactersâ€™ self pools could hit 10 points and remove them from play. Each character could begin with as much as five in one of the self pools (a 3 from one father and a 2 from another) and the bidding for opposing self pools with other powerful beings could raise any of the self pools by a large amount very quickly. Increasing the lowest self pool for each failure also increases the speed that 10 could be reached. The ability of mounts to occasionally reduce the self pools seems like it would be ineffective against the steady increases. Carefully playtesting these rules and ensuring they produce the kind of play you want will be key here. <br/><br/><b>Integration of the Sheet â€“ 7/10</b> <br/>The game uses the aspects of the character sheet to good effect. The day and night fathers, the mother, and the mounts are all very evocative. However, the status section of the character sheet is not given the same attention and color, and itâ€™s not clear who the Debased and the Sisters and Brothers are and what their role in the world is. <br/><br/><b>Cool Factor â€“ 8/10</b> <br/>The color in your setting of a nomadic empire of horse lords abandoned by its gods that also left their bastard children (i.e., the characters) behind is awesome. The various locations, the gods, and the mounts weave a vivid picture of the setting. You also provide a brief treatment of what you see the characters doing, but you donâ€™t give adequate support to this vision throughout the rules. Thereâ€™s a lot of awesome here and I encourage you to further develop it and fill in the few gaps.<br/><br/><b>Total â€“ 20/30</b> <br/>This is a strong skeleton of a game in need of just a little more meat to make it singâ€”exactly what you hope to get from a contest like this. I really want to see this game get developed and realize its potential, which I think is quite high. Dark Mongol-esque demigods battling abominations with the aid of their trusty steeds is a game Iâ€™d play.                        </div>

                            Tragedy by Eva Schiffer based on a sheet by Shreyas Sampat<br/><br/>First impressions. This game has an inspired subtitle which makes me happy from the start. It's use of the character sheet as a grammatical engine for drama is a solid foundation. As is setting up sessions by way of playbills. There are several really cool features such as special rule for eavesdropping characters, wonderfully vindictive shakespearean elements like poisoning and dueling, and a system for shifting the paths that upset expections in a nice way. On the potential improvements side of the ledger, the game seems over complex in parts and there is too much crammed into each act. Also, I felt like it could have used something to provide a dramatic punch at the end. <br/><br/>Playability: 6<br/><br/>I think the game would work but there would be some chores weighing down the fun parts.  I would drop the minor changes, not require players to define minor character's motivations.  I'd be happier if everything focused on making the question: which pathways will the characters take? - as dramatic as possible. (The pathways are sequences of 'because X, I must do Y lest Z happen). So the pathways, the shifting, and the shakespearean eccentricity-generating systems are what I like. A final obstacle to really energizing play would seem to be the absence of a rule or structure to differentiate the end of the game.<br/><br/>Integration of character sheet into the Game: 8<br/><br/>Very good use age of the three columns and connecting arrows. I'm giving an 8 rather than a 9 or 10 because the sheet elements are integrated well but then seem to be a few factors among many.<br/><br/>general cool factor: 8<br/><br/>Lots of cool stuff as I mentioned, they just need to be profiled more by cutting back other stuff.<br/><br/>total: 22                        </div>

                            This Place<br/>Joe Prince, from sheet by Mark Vallianatos<br/><br/>Playability of the Game: 4<br/>Integration of Character Sheet: 5<br/>General Cool Factor:  2<br/>Overall Score:  11<br/><br/>'This Place' is a game about figuring out who someone is and where they are.  It doesn't really add much to the sheet as it came from Mark, because you look at the sheet, and think, "Hmm, I wonder who this person is and where they are?"  And Joe says, "Yes, that's the question, isn't it?"  In the right context it could be clever... once.  But the single rule the game adds is that you sort of haphazardly randomly determine which player's view of reality is correct, and then you're done.  It didn't strike me as a very good way of facilitating creativity, one of the main reasons I like to roleplay.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that what we're seeing here writ large, and what I've seen in fits and spurts in some of the other games I've reviewed so far is the RPG Designer's version of the White Room Syndrome.  To quote the <a href="http://www.sfwa.org/writing/turkeycity.html" rel="nofollow">Turkey City Lexicon</a>:
<blockquote><b>White Room Syndrome</b><br/>A clear and common sign of the failure of the author's imagination, most often seen at the beginning of a story, before the setting, background, or characters have gelled. "She awoke in a white room." The 'white room' is a featureless set for which details have yet to be invented -- a failure of invention by the author. The character 'wakes' in order to begin a fresh train of thought -- again, just like the author. This 'white room' opening is generally followed by much earnest pondering of circumstances and useless exposition; all of which can be cut, painlessly.</blockquote>
In an RPG context, this failure of imagination is foisted off onto the players, who are forced to start in the white room, handed paintbrushes, and then abandoned.  In 'This Place' the players are handed a pencil with which to create a few doodles, and a black paint roller with which to blot out other people's doodles.<br/><br/>Now, RPGs are inherently dependent on creative input from the players.  To extend the metaphor a bit too far, the game designer must leave white sections of the room for the players to fill in, and give them paintbrushes, pencils, pens, or chalk as is appropriate.  The trick is to fill in the right amount, and leave unfilled the right amount.  I thought 'You Got Ta Be Startin Sumthin' got this right--the players are told to determine the cause of the apocalypse, and the nature of the 'Zombies', but the game itself fills in the results of the apocalypse and complete rules for dealing with the Zombies in whatever form they manifest themselves.  I took issue with 'Artifact Retrieval Corps' 'rule' of "Fill in Body, Mind, and Spirit however you like," because it felt more like a failure of imagination on David's part than it did a deliberate choice that sprang from the game itself.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's quite the digression.  A 'White Room' game could be done well (just as a white room short story could be done well) but it would require a thorough understanding of the form, and probably take quite a bit of work.  'This Place' is not that game, though it possibly could be developed into one given enough time and effort.<br/><br/>Is it playable?  Sort of.  There are gaps even in the minimal ruleset (how exactly does one change order?  Why would you ever simply accept someone's answers? What if you're playing with more or less than four people?  What if you're last to go and your section is the only one unchallenged?), but more seriously, I think it violates the Siskel Criteria of RPGs.  The Siskel Criteria for movies is, "Is this movie more interesting than watching the same set of actors have lunch?"  The Siskel Criteria for RPGs is therefore, "Is playing this RPG more interesting than having lunch with your friends?"  The fact that there's never any synthesis of ideas here, merely bland acceptance or rejection, makes the game much less interesting than it could have been.<br/><br/>The character sheet itself is integrated into the game only by default.  Almost nothing is added to integrate, meaning the game itself sort of limps along with the provided character sheet as a crutch.  It doesn't do much actual reverse engineering, and instead just points.<br/><br/>As for the cool factor, the game didn't really grab me, as is probably clear by now.  I am somewhat intrigued by the idea of a 'White Room Game', and if Joe decided to develop this idea, it might turn into the ideal example of the trope, which would be great, both because it could be a very unique and fun experience, and also because then nobody else would have to write it again ;-)                        </div>

                            I thought somebody said somewhere that sheet designers should review the resulting games from their sheets so here:<br/><br/><b>Something Is Rising The City Will Fall</b><br/>Game: Graham Walmsley<br/>Sheet: meeeeeeee!<br/><br/>Playability: 9<br/>Integration of sheet: 7<br/>Cool factor: 6<br/>Total: 22<br/><br/>When I threw down with this sheet, I had a strong feeling that the resulting game would have Tarot cards in the mechanics, for obvious reasons. I also designed along a circular, spirally motif. I didn't predict the elegant navigational scheme that Graham came up with: once around the sheet equals the story. I also didn't predict the straight-ahead, marvelously satisfying use of the chili dog, which I totally intended as a random-ass turd in the punchbowl. I mean, of <i>course</i> the hot dog is home base! You start there, you end there, the story ends there because <i>when you have a hot dog, everything is okay!</i> Beautiful.<br/><br/>Drawings in the golden spiral = teh awesome. This is a fantastic way to do traits but leave them open to interpretation. Also, since the rectangles shrink as you get closer to the center, this naturally draws the other players (at any given time, the GMs) to use the larger traits more often; they can't <i>see</i> the others.<br/><br/>I am a little let down by where it goes from there: play a trick-taking game, use it as the basis for narration, move your mice* based on which special cards come up, set stakes by relating it to the bidding in a trick-taking game. This is partly because I suck at trick-taking games and partly because I fetishize innovation for its own sake. So ignore me: this whole part is why the game gets such a high Playability rating. I'm thinking it is probably as rock-solid as the card game it's built around. (I do worry whether the bet stakes of "unharmed," "injured" and "killed" are really granular enough, but that will shake out in playtesting.)<br/><br/>Finally, I loves me some games where everything goes to hell and detectives lose their minds. The examples have everything go Lovecraftian and I don't think that's coincidence. I think this game could be mashed up productively with games like Delta Green and Unknown Armies, that embrace the whole urban-organism-as-massive-fecund-nightmare thing. Dig!<br/><br/>I want to play this thing, and I almost never get motivated about games with premade settings these days. I also definitely want to get down at least a first draft of my own solo riff on this sheet. I think I will steal the traits-as-pictures thing.<br/><br/>* Mousetrap reference - there are no actual mice in the game                        </div>

                            Mike Sugarbaker just posted a review about the sheet he designed, and its ensuing game.<br/>I'm going to follow suit<br/><br/>Not/Guilty<br/>Game: Shreyas Sampat<br/>Sheet: Me.<br/><br/>Not/Guilty is awesome as an artifact. The game itself is pretty cool, but more than anything I am wowed by how Shreyas turned reading-the-rules into the in-play activity. Shreyas' creative use of the GAME TEXT as PLAY OBJECT is totally innovative and cool.<br/><br/>Playability: 7<br/><br/>Like I said: Shreyas did something cool with turning the game text into a play object.<br/>This is a cool concept, but one with a lot of rough edges still apparent in Not/Guilty. The <br/><br/>Integration: 10<br/><br/>Almost seemless integration of the sheet.<br/>I like how you used it as an interview sheet, and placed counters on the inkblot.<br/>It's cool because you made the sheet integral to play, as well as the text. Awesomeness.<br/>I like how the layout, in ways, mirrors the sheet - but the sheet still stands out too.<br/><br/>The use of the inkblot was cool. It's something I'd never thought of, and I like that you could take my sheet somewhere that I hadn't expected.<br/><br/>I think you could have integrated the four "Attributes" in the upper lefthand corner a bit better.<br/>The way they were integrated into the rules seems not-quite-perfect.<br/><br/>Cool Factor: 8<br/><br/>The sheet was pretty set in its tone and setting. I perhaps swung it TOO HEAVILY in one direction (which is why the unique physical format and use of the text as an in-play object was so crucial and so awesome).<br/><br/>Still, you created something cool. Your way of creating names in this game was hella, hella cool. You get a full Cool Factor point from that alone.<br/><br/>25/30.<br/>Good work man. With some polishing, this KIND of gameplay could become a really awesome gateway into roleplaying games.                        </div>

<b>fatalism</b><br/>Fred Lenza, reverse engineered from a sheet by Matthijs Holter<br/><br/>First, I have to say the review of this game was a well-received task. I hadn't looked at all the sheets submitted to the reverse engineering endeavor prior to the design phase, but many of them, and were this a draft I would almost certainly have picked Matthijs Holter's spare but compelling sheet for my own reverse engineering efforts.<br/><br/><b>Playability Of The Game:</b> <br/><br/>Scenes in the game are instances of looming death for a character. But they play out almost non-mechanically: the GM has unconstrained oversight of the in-game situation, and the other players make unregulated suggestions to the player of the threatened character. The threatened player wants his character to make it through the scene without triggering the pre-determined agent of death, and the other players who have knowledge of the real threats want to help and hinder the threatened player's decisionmaking. I imagine it'll play out quite frenetically, as a chaos of shouting, just like scenes in Vincent Baker's Matchmaker. It's an exhausting play dynamic. But by no means broken.<br/><br/>I do think the mechanics for how the game continues once a character is dead need to be cut from the game. The play dynamic is going to be exhausting. I think the game needs to end when the first character dies.<br/><br/>Score for playability: 8 of 10<br/><br/><b>Usefulness Of The Character Sheet:</b><br/><br/>In one sentence the text goes from calling it a "character sheet" to a "card." Also it recommends printing the sheets/cards on transparencies (or copying the front of the sheet onto the back to replicate the effect of transparency), and cropping or redrawing them so the arrow starts exactly in the lower corner. And the mechanics of the game depend upon these modifications. In fact, the sheet in this altered form is fundamental to the mechanical functioning of play, far far moreso than a traditional character sheet. <br/><br/>That said, the actual mechanics are nicely clever. I quite like the way they imply the Grim Reaper travelling a drunkard's walk into and out of the characters' scenes. Fred, if you develop further I recommend 4" x 6" as the ideal size for the cards. But for the rev/eng design endeavor I do think the expectation is that games should have fewer sheet customizations than we see here. <br/><br/>Score for use of the sheet: 3 of 10<br/><br/>(Huge kudos, however, for disregarding contest concerns that might have otherwise smothered your design mojo.)<br/><br/><b>Wow, That's Cool Factor:</b><br/><br/>Well, this one's the subjective score. And as playable and mechanically clever as the game seems to be, it just doesn't grab me. It's a series of scenes where characters try to dodge improbable threats, like the death scenes in Dead Like Me, except without a compelling story context. And I don't much care for Dead Like Me.<br/><br/>Score for wow factor: 4 of 10<br/><br/>Total: 15 of 30<br/><br/>And blech, do I hate writing reviews or what? I'm far better at asking good questions and having a productive design conversation about a rules draft than I am at grading them. Grading someone's creative heart and soul makes me feel like scat. And the Reverse Engineering endeavor is fucking hard. Several orders of magnitude harder than the Game Chef. Just the fact of completing a game is a glorious achievement.<br/><br/>So, Fred, to make myself feel better, some hopefully productive rules questions/suggestions:<br/><br/>1. The player sitting opposite of the threatened player is the GM. What if you have an odd number of players?<br/>2. "If a character survives as a direct result of a clue given by the voice of reason, the player portraying the voice of reason may place another dash on any edge of his character sheet which already has a dash." I'm confused. Is the voice of reason placing a dash on his own sheet? Or on the sheet of the other player whose character just survived death?<br/>3. "It is recommended that the other parts of the paranoia conceal who the voice of reason is." How do you keep it secret if he's placing a dash on a sheet that's in the middle of the table?<br/>4. I really like the inclusion of the Kubler-Ross progression. But your implementation of Depression seems forced. Your description of it seems more like Desperation than it does Depression. Though I can see why. A truer implementation of Depression would involve the character lacking the motivation to take action despite consequences, and that would be pretty boring. But if you can't come up with a truer implementation of Depression that describes something other than inaction, you might have to ditch the explicit reference to the Kubler-Ross progression. <br/>5. If a player manages to complete his character's objective without being killed, he gets to re-align the cards and position another character for being threatened in the next scene. You write that he "may also flip the other player's character sheet." Is this a left-right flip only? Or is top-bottom flipping allowed as well?<br/>6. In the example of play, it's determined that Lois fails to complete her objective because the door of the market is fused shut by the explosion that didn't actually kill her. This justification for her failure to complete the objective seems pretty arbitrary and tacked on after the player has already avoided death. I think the game needs some guidelines for how and when a failure to complete an objective can be established.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

<b>Artifact Retrieval Corps</b><br/>David Wendt, reverse engineered from a character sheet by Mike Wormley<br/><br/><b>Playability Of The Game:</b> <br/><br/>If there are mechanically significant omissions or loose ends in Artifact Retrieval Corps, I can't find them. The text is surprisingly playtest-ready for such a challenging design contest and short deadline. David sure seems to have taken Mike's intimidating two-page sheet on its own terms and built a solid, and mostly traditional mission based game. But it's not so old school that the Profession, Hobbies, Powers, and etc. aren't nicely left open to player creativity. I like the way the Body, Mind, and Spirit attributes work as size constraints on the player dice pool, and how Disadvantages work, and how Endurance and Power get depleted by players choosing to utilize traits beyond the Body, Mind, and Spirit limits. There's some confusion in my head about whether the text actually means "conflict resolution" when it uses the phrase, and the advancement rewards for driving campaign play seem rather weak. But I can't say the game isn't playable.<br/><br/>Score for playability: 9 of 10<br/><br/><b>Usefulness Of The Character Sheet:</b><br/><br/>One very small cheat: I find it unlikely, for instance, that more than one (or at most two) of the rows of pips under Profession is going to get used, despite the implication embedded in the sheet design that multiple rows of pips are necessary. But otherwise an amazing job of using the whole sheet. And I love how the pieces of the sheet are referenced in the text as actual physical pieces of the character's equipment (e.g. Status Meter, Rations Condensor).<br/><br/>Score for use of the sheet: 10 of 10<br/><br/><b>Wow, That's Cool Factor:</b><br/><br/>Again, this one's the subjective score. So...I <i>love</i> the character races. Utterly and totally. And I'm pretty keen on the artifact recovery concept as well. It reminds me of the short-lived Marvel Warheads comic book. But I think the hard-boiled grunts aesthetic is a bit flat, the reward mechanics don't hook me, and the setting's most powerful thematic juice is artificially distant from the characters. I like the CTY 2061 event in the timeline, and I'd like to see continued pure strain human entitlement and prejudice against second stage humans as thematic issues in the game. I like the Asheys. I'd like to see the incitements of uninformed speculation about their objectives as a political and thematic issue in the game. And I think it's a mistake to keep the chaos of the Asheys distant from the activities of the player characters. I also might like to see politics internal to the Corps as an issue, ala Warheads.<br/><br/>Score for wow factor: 5 of 10<br/><br/>Total: 24 of 30<br/><br/>And David, as with my review of fatalism, because constructive feedback makes me feel better, some hopefully productive suggestions:<br/><br/>1. I think you need to put some surreality into your setting. Have you read the Warheads comics? If not, I definitely recommend getting your hands on them, at least the first few issues. If you're going to sell a mission based game, I think it needs a setting that's not just a transparently recolored Vietnam. Warheads will be inspiring.<br/>2. I think you should prohibit player invented character races. You don't want a Star Wars cantina universe. Put the edge of surreality on the setting, but have fixed character races.<br/>3. And be careful of over-defining your character races. You don't need to define them much more than you already have. Get some artwork that puts characters of the various races in powerful situations, and that suggests cultural details, but don't write those cultural details into the text. Maybe even have stark shadowing in the illustrations to hide significant details. You want to inspire player groups to take ownership of the races, not establish them so carefully that you create "you're not playing him right" debates.<br/>4. Missions should involve the characters interacting with the local populace.<br/>5. The setting secret option where the Murpei are actually the Ancient Ones is trite.<br/>6. Playtest your general rule and your optional rule for spending extra pips for traits, then pick one and ditch the other. No optional rules allowed!<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

<b>Vesna Thaw</b>, by Nathan Paoletta<br/><br/>Vesna Thaw is a game about post-Soviet, post-apocalypse, robot pilots. Players play these brave pilots that use their robots to help their small isolated community survive and grow until they go down in one final blaze of glory.<br/><br/><b>Playability:</b> 8/10<br/>As I read this game, I could definitely imagine myself playing it. The mechanics didn't seem to have any trip up points. My biggest problem came in the Robot Scenes section. The section describes how a player's opponent applies their robot's Element dice to the conflict, but the text never specifies how the player uses those dice. Fortunately, the play example seems to illustrate the proper use of the dice.<br/><br/><b>Usefulness of the character sheet:</b> 6/10<br/>I think that Nathan put a lot of effort into using every element of the character sheet, but many of the elements found on the sheet are mapped to new names in the game. The most extreme example of this are the Community boxes in the upper left corner of the sheet. The Community dice names in the game text are Technology Level, Leadership, Population, and Stability. I think that this leads to a dissonance between the sheet and the game.<br/><br/><b>Wow, that's cool factor:</b> 10/10<br/>Post-soviet, post-apocalypse, robot pilots. As if that wasn't enough you get to collaboratively draw your robot with the other players, and then give it mechanical weight. This game seems like it would be tons of fun to play.<br/><br/><b>Total:</b> 24/30                        </div>

<b>Celestial Soap</b>, by Christian Griffen<br/><br/>Celestial Soap is a game in which the players act out a soap opera using techniques inspired by the chinese art of oral storytelling.<br/><br/><b>Playability:</b> 8/10<br/>Celestial Soap is in a playable form, however I personally needed to read the game more than once to catch pieces that I had missed on my first read. I think the text could really benefit from examples, both of play and of the elements like Fearful Symmetries and symbol interpretations.<br/><br/><b>Usefulness of the character sheet:</b> 7/10<br/>I found Christian's interpretation of this sheet to be very interesting, particularly the use of the Sky and Earth diagrams.

                            OK, finally went through all the sheets to make my yearbook selections.  And here they are!<br/><br/><b>Most Intimidating:  <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/jeff%20moore.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jeff Moore</a></b> (aka 'the one with the octogon around the "d10"')<br/><br/>Man, all those lines and dashed lines with a hint of order to 'em?  The thought of trying to first come up with a reasonable explanation for them all and then, in turn, to have to explain that system to naive players gave me the heebie-jeebies.<br/><br/>A close runner-up was Kristin Cook's, because, really, William Shatner?  As a game design element?  *boggle boggle boggle*.<br/><br/>Kristin Cook's was perhaps more personally frightening because when the list first came up, my name was paired with hers.  Fortunately for my own sanity, that turned out to have been a mistake, since Kristin was sheet-only, but was listed as *my* sheet's designer.  Whew.<br/><br/><b>Crunchiest:  <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/EricDownton.pdf" rel="nofollow">Eric Downtown</a></b> (aka 'the one with three or four boxes for every line item on the sheet')<br/><br/>It's possible that a game from this sheet could have a fairly coherent rule system, but you know it would be high-crunch.  It's just too focused on numbers and their local effect vs. their extended effect to be anything but.<br/><br/><b>Exciting: <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Tobias%20op%20den%20Brouw%20sheet%20only.pdf" rel="nofollow">Tobias op den Brouw</a></b>  (aka 'The Dinosaur Reality Show')<br/><br/>This just looked like fun.  Many things on this sheet have obvious directions in which to take 'em, and I think it would have been a kick to get to design a game for it and more fully explore the setting.  And the most fun about designing it would be that then I'd get to playtest it, and it looked like a fun game to play!<br/><br/><b>Most Likely To Succeed:  <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/matthijs%20holtersheet%20only.pdf" rel="nofollow">Matthijs Holter</a></b> (aka 'Death Arrow')<br/><br/>The only problem someone might have with this sheet would be choice paralysis: with too much freedom, it can become too hard to make a decision.  But with the creative bunch we have here, I figure that almost all of us could have come up with a decent game for this sheet.  Spare, but oddly evocative.<br/><br/><b>Prettiest:  <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/jonathan%20walton.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Walton</a></b> (aka 'The One With The Dreaded Tangut A-Go-Go')<br/><br/>Everything about this sheet was pretty.  The figure, the oriental characters, the borders, the fonts, the shading, the designs, the symmetry of 'Earth' and 'Sky' around, well, 'Symmetries'.  This was an easy choice.<br/><br/>I didn't nominate Paul Czege's sheet for anything because I actually got that one, so I figured at this point that I was no longer unbiased.  But it was an awesome sheet to work with, and had just the right amount of stuff that was nailed down (like the names of the stats) and offers (like the leaves and the coils).  Thanks again, Paul.  (And, notwithstanding your hatred of reviews, I'd love to hear your response to my game, whether that be a review or a series of questions or something else.)                        </div>

                            Back from vacation early, so here are my reviews:<br/>
<br/>
Game Designer: Graham Walmsley<br/>
Sheet Designer: Mike Sugarbaker<br/>
Game Name: Something is rising: The city will fall<br/>
<br/>
Summary: Well, I was hoping for a game about Greek Kabala loving hot dog vendors plaguing the City of New York, but what I got was a horror game about a group of people descending into madness as they fight a horror that is taking over their town.<br/>
<br/>
1. Playability of the Game: 9<br/>
<br/>
The game seems completely playable, except Iâ€™ve never been able to catch onto card games like the one that is used to resolve the scenes. <br/>
<br/>
2. Usefulness of the Character Sheet: 8<br/>
<br/>
It works for the game, but itâ€™s a stretch to make it work. How a hot dog becomes a city, I donâ€™t know. In this case, the character sheet limits the mood of the game, and if the game is further developed a character sheet that is in tune with the mood should be designed.<br/>
<br/>
Still, what else can be done with a character sheet that has a hot dog on it? This was a valiant effort. Way to go, Graham!<br/>
<br/>
3. Wow, thatâ€™s Cool factor: 10<br/>
<br/>
What can I say? The character sheet had a hot dog, and Graham made a cool game from it. Iâ€™m sure the game can use some fleshing out, but all the pieces are there. This is a simple no prep game that seems to be right up my alley. Plus it looks fun. This game needs to be developed further. Nice examples of play.<br/>
<br/>
Total: 27<br/>
<br/>
Game Designer: Russell Collins <br/>
Sheet Designer: Nathan Paoletta<br/>
Game Name: Children of the Sun, Children of the Moon<br/>
<br/>
Summary: Children of the Sun, Children of the Moon is a game in which the players take the role of travelers that arrive in places that have to be fixed. They confront the conflict and enemies by gambling chips on the throw of one coin. The players have the chance to gain special powers and to join together to become stronger.<br/>
<br/>
1. Playability of the Game: 6<br/>
<br/>
The game seems that it might work, but probably needs some play testing. I like the gambling aspect, but wonder if the characters will have enough refreshes to defeat the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
2. Usefulness of the Character Sheet: 9<br/>
<br/>
The game uses the character sheet in an excellent way. The character sheet doesnâ€™t support the joining of the travelers.<br/>
<br/>
3. Wow, thatâ€™s Cool factor: 7<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool. I think the setting and color needs some fleshing out, and the gambling system needs some tweaking, but overall, I think this is pretty cool.<br/>

You may only find up to two more Angles than your opponent in the collisionâ€ are just as confusing in the context of the game as they are out. The game would definitely benefit from some examples of play, and could be clarified in quite a few places.<br/><br/>The rules for bumps seem somewhat open to abuse, especially the ability to get a bump (an increase to your influence, effectively), simply by agreeing to do so with another Angel. <br/><br/>The game seems to play like a board game with some roleplay interaction layered on top, which is neat, if not entirely my thing. I think the game would work just as well as a strategy game without any of the roleplay elements, which are somewhat arbitrary and vague, with terms such as â€œprobablyâ€ and â€œpossiblyâ€ bandied about in the rules.<br/><br/>Usefulness of Sheet â€“ 8 <br/><br/>William makes interesting and original use out of a somewhat tricky sheet, using it not as a character sheet but as a board for the game.<br/><br/>Cool Factor â€“ 5<br/><br/>The concept of playing bad mother-angels messing up some poor schmoeâ€™s life is very cool, even if the execution is not entirely to my tastes. I would have liked to have seen a few more overt roleplay elements in the game, rather than favouring the board game style as written, but again, this is purely my personal tastes showing through. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>William Burke has taken an intriguing sheet and turned it into an intriguing board game/story game with a good deal of potential, if the rules confusions can be cleared up with examples of play and clarifications. It could be even better if the board game element was downplayed entirely, and the roleplay potential of the rather cool concept used to its fullest!                        </div>

                            Alrighty, my sheet votes (with thanks to Troy Holaday for making the combined file that solved for me the challenge of dealing with 65 separate pdfs):<br/><br/><b>Most intimidating</b><br/><br/>I very nearly gave this one to Carl Muckenhoupt's sheet. Because clearly, the sheet has an embedded organizing purpose (the Sentences and Prepositions suggest that language is thematically and mechanically significant), but for the life of me I can't figure out what the stat abbreviations might mean, and I can totally see myself floundering and lost in trying to realize the awesomeness of a Man-as-Logos game. Carl's sheet is intimidating as a temptation that could destroy me.<br/><br/>But ultimately, my "most intimidating" vote goes to Lucian Smith's sheet. Every player is a lighthouse? And the mechanically significant details are Illumination, Sturdiness, Accessibility, and Equipment? I could do a game about the people operating a lighthouse, but the sheet doesn't really offer that option. It leaves you struggling to figure out what represents meaningful adversity for a lighthouse?<br/><br/><b>Crunchiest</b><br/><br/>Well, Eric Downton and a number of others have certainly delivered some old school crunch. But my vote in this category goes to Stefan Koch. I think I could handle the Depth and Width of Knowledge boxes. In fact, I bet it could be seriously clever to have traits that advance in both depth and width. And probably I could integrate the Earth/Water/Air/Fire object and the Influence and Asset objects as well. But damn, there's also the North/South/East/West and  Winter/Summer/Spring/Autumn objects, and concentric dartboard thing. It's just too much, an explosion of fiddly bits that I think would just utterly defy my creative efforts to make them coherent. (And definitely I need to read The Best Thing, because I'm super curious to see what Mark did with this sheet.)<br/><br/><b>Most exciting</b><br/><br/>My vote here goes to Jason Sims. His bullseye sheet is practically a movie trailer.<br/><br/><b>Most likely to succeed</b><br/><br/>I almost gave this one to Dirk Remmecke, because his sheet is so open and utterly accommodating of whatever a game a designer might be inclined to create. But upon reflection, a sheet with so little agenda of its own might be rather problematic for designers without a burning and inherent creative purpose of their own. And I actually think a lot of folks with design ambitions fall into this category. They want to be designers because they love the hobby, because they're like diagnosing and fixing problems in the published games they love to play, because they like writing, and because designing seems like the next level for them. But I think they'll probably flounder without more creative constraints than what Dirk's sheet provides. So my vote goes to Judson Lester, whose sheet suggests a traditional play dynamic, but flavors it with some unconventional (but not intimidatingly so) character attributes and a few (not impossible) curve balls (e.g. Bent, Charge, What I hate about this character). <br/><br/><b>Best design</b><br/><br/>Hands down, this one goes to Roger Carbol. (And I almost gave it Most Exciting as well.) There's an awesome roleplaying game inside this sheet, and it's all coherently strung together conceptually by a central organizing device that thematically focuses both the design effort and then ultimately the work of the player during gameplay. <br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>You should design a game for his sheet.</blockquote>
I knew you'd say that.  Sadly time is not on my side, plus I've been asked to help design a trad game set in the Great Game period.<br/><br/>To be honest though, I'm not sure indie game design would be one of my strong points, I appreciate a lot of the indie games (I'm a big fan of MLwM, which I really enjoyed playing and which worked extremely well) but I get the most fun most reliably from more traditional rpgs.<br/><br/>Still, I shall look at it and see if anything strikes me, but it's a challenging sheet.                        </div>

                            I didn't want to post my reviews. I sent them in a while ago and was hoping they would be available through the contest page first. Now it looks like I'm the only one not published here so . . .<br/><br/>Fred Hicks: Chimaera on Adam Drayâ€™s character sheet.<br/><br/>Total: 23<br/><br/>Playability: 6<br/>A well formed set of mechanics using elements of scene framing, escalation, consolation for a loser, transformation of a character and rock, paper, scissors! I was left with a few questions however that went unanswered about change of state, turn order and forming relationships. I can provide details to Fred on request (because I want to see him keep going with this.) I enjoy the communal creation of the setting but wanted to see some steps reordered.<br/><br/>Integration of Character Sheet: 8<br/>Fredâ€™s added some good things on to this sheet and the â€œchangesâ€ of folding the sheet are a terrific way to follow through on the different States that Adamâ€™s sheet calls for. Fred also made good use of the webbing linking abilities together.<br/><br/>Coolness: 9<br/>Who doesnâ€™t want to â€œhulk outâ€ and level a city block, potentially killing everyone youâ€™ve ever known and loved? Seriously!<br/><br/><br/>Judson Lester: Bullseye on Jason Simsâ€™ character sheet<br/><br/>Total: 19<br/><br/>Playability: 5<br/>Considering the unique handling of play turns and the influence players have over each other I would have preferred more play examples. It took some repeat reading to get the flow of mechanics solidly in mind. Some very striking concepts though, and a good use of physical tokens to let players see the effect of their actions on each otherâ€™s characters.<br/><br/>Integration of Character Sheet: 8<br/>Judson did well with an unusual character sheet, especially in embracing what the sheet leaves out as mysteries to be discovered by the other players through narration. <br/><br/>Coolness: 6<br/>The â€œtough-guyâ€ tone of the text evokes the right guy noir voice. Visions of chase movies came to mind as I was reading, so it definitely has a strong atmosphere. I want the concept fully fleshed-out however, again with more examples showing what is considered a good narrative choice.                        </div>

<b>Title:</b> Utopolis: Policing the Retrofuture<br/><b>Character Sheet Designer:</b> Thom Foster<br/><b>RPG Designer:</b> Eric J. Boyd<br/><br/><b>General Comments:</b><br/>A RPG of crime solving in a future inspired by 1950's futurists, Utopolis has significant potential despite its rough spots. Particularly compelling, the PCs are former criminals themselves, who have had their memories wiped and are serving time as police detectives. All that remains is a muse describing what their original crime was, and the dramatic recurrence of the fear of committing the crime again and the flaw that lead down that road in the first place. <br/><br/>Less compelling, but still of interest is that each player also takes on the role of another player's robotic partner, with a handful of tokens to affect the other player's scenes. It is said that the robot is to keep the partner in line, but there isn't much motivation for them. This seems more present to accommodate an additional part of the character sheet, although it has definite untapped potential. <br/><br/>The overall structure of the game is to solve one crime after another, occasionally confronting a character's hidden memories in fear/flaw scene (which are triggered by pushing, so players always have a choice to cause or avoid one). These scenes can eventually lead to breakdowns, or baring such characters will eventually leave the force and retire as upright citizens who fully forgets her or his crime. The suggestion of a broken character being discovered as the culprit of the crime under investigation is an excellent one, and fully justifies letting those characters keep on until the current crime is solved.<br/><br/>As far as solving crimes, Utopolis borrows significantly from Troy Costisick's Holmes and Watson Committee from this past Game Chef competition, inheriting some of the problems in that design, though fixing a few as well. Chief among the borrowings is the central, though somewhat nebulous, accumulation of clues and the promotion of those clues into evidence. <br/><br/>Since evidence is never pinned downed mechanically or in a fictional legal sense, it becomes an implicit communal pacing mechanic - as players choose to make some clues evidence to speed the case along. The acquisition of clues is also somewhat limited, being reserved solely for winning conflicts between characters, leading to the odd effect that it "takes two to make a clue." <br/><br/>In addition, clues that might be found within a conflict are determined by a question die, where the clue helps answer the who, what where, etc. of the crime. The difficulty being that it is unclear when a clue is interpreted (made to help answer this question). In genre this happens sometime after the clue is discovered, but this mechanic suggests that the clue's meaning is narrated in its discovery. <br/><br/>Another major concern is the conflict resolution mechanic, which is a somewhat tricky poker variant based on hands drawn by conflict participants. Comparing the hands comes down to four different ranks and intermediate comparisons within these, to break ties and to award cinema points (which are a general character resource for drawing more cards and inserting narration). The cinema award is particularly unclear, I believe it should be gain an additional cinema point equal to how much larger your largest X of a kind is versus the largest your opponent's have, but I cannot be sure.<br/><br/>On the whole, the resolution mechanic could be much simpler, without losing anything in terms of game effect. I suggest making clear distinctions (possibly, but not necessarily mechanically) between leads (given when the GM wins a conflict), clues, and evidence. Also, I think the game would benefit from interleaving crimes and generally more guidance for GMs in setting up an interesting crime or crimes. Lastly, the character by character end game results in either breakdown or blissful retirement, you cannot presently have a character learn to live with the knowledge of their crime. This seems to be a rich vein of potential left untapped.<br/><br/><b>Estimated Playability:</b> 6<br/><br/>Definitely a playable game, the only issues here are whether or not it plays the way intended, and how many omissions need to be filled in by the players and the GM. Some things help, like fear/flaw tests, other things get in the way, like the direct link between conflicts and clues. <br/><br/><b>Incorporation of Character Sheet:</b> 8<br/><br/>The character sheet looks and feels right for the game, although some elements feel more strained. Certainly the sheet has not been abandoned by the designer, and he has brought out aspects that might otherwise have been forgettable.<br/><br/><b>Coolness Factor:</b> 6<br/><br/>I find the idea of the game very compelling. The execution has many problems, some of which detract. But ultimately I want this game to be better than it currently is, and that if anything else, is coolness factor. <br/><br/><b>Total Score:</b> 20                        </div>

<b>Title:</b> Motes in the Eye of the Emperor<br/><b>Character Sheet Designer:</b> Jeff Moore<br/><b>RPG Designer:</b> Alexander Cherry<br/><br/><b>General Comments:</b><br/>Imagine you are a virtuous bureaucrat taken from your earthly domain and brought to manage the technological heaven beyond your world. What would you do? That is the question that never quite gets answered in this RPG. More clearly, Motes is incomplete, and avowedly stated so by the author. <br/><br/>Things start out well enough, futuristic colony of Chinese descent, and emperor in some refined space station watching and maintaining order, above and below. Complex protocols incomprehensible to the players, and an evocative beginning scene where players introduce characters, and then go around choosing whether to be that character. After that, the momentum appears to be lost. <br/><br/>The main difficulty is the lack of motivation. The reward mechanic gives you experience when you roll doubles on a percentile roll, regardless of success. This reduces your aspects, and gives you experience. Experience may do something, but what it might be is omitted. Regardless though each turn players go around and attempt actions, gaining experience a tenth of the time they roll. What aspect is rolled under is determined by the key aspect, which, reflecting the opacity of the centuries of protocols, define how something must be attempted, or if it cannot be done auspiciously.  <br/><br/>But ultimately, none of these provide a sense for what characters actually do, or why they do them. It is the Emperor's job to figure that out, by framing a scene for each player in turn. Characters also gain abilities, which allow them to "do the impossible" and hold some special post within the bureaucracy. But since no example aspects are show, it is extremely unclear what this means for a player. After all in a sci-fi setting, what actually qualifies as impossible, and which of those should be impossible even with an ability.<br/><br/>While Motes is only a fragment of a RPG, several major problems are already creeping into the design. Specifically, the resolution mechanic, while functional is overemphasized and ill-suited to the themes of the game. At the same time play dynamics and motivations are largely ignored. It has potential, but needs a lot of work to bring out the "awesome" as the author puts it. <br/><br/><b>Estimated Playability:</b> 2<br/>As a fragment it is definitely not playable, but the set-up of the first scene especially shows that some parts are eminently playable.<br/><br/><b>Incorporation of Character Sheet:</b> 7<br/>The character sheet was largely incorporated, the only discrepancy is that the I Ching symbols are left as flavor, rather than incorporated within the game more generally. The mechanics in the game followed the character sheet quite loyally, possibly to some detriment in the design (see below).<br/><br/><i>Aside:</i> The character sheet here came with its own difficulties. Specifically, according to the formulas written on the sheet: Willpower = Perception, Endurance = Grace, and Accuracy = Charm. I've factored this in with the sheet being harder to incorporate successfully. <br/><br/><b>Coolness Factor:</b> 5<br/>The setting is very good, but the choice of characters within the setting seems somewhat lack-luster. Celestial bureaucrats could be very interesting, but I found myself much more interesting in what had happened before they became chosen (undergoing trials, testing, and various intrigues), rather than once they arrive at the heavenly spaceport. <br/><br/><b>Total Score:</b> 14                        </div>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Thanks for the review. I really appreciate the time you took to provide substantive feedback. Your points regarding the lead, clue, and evidence distinctions are right on and a place where the game needs definite thought. With respect to clue interpretation using the question die, you're right that the genre usually interprets a clue after its discovery. Perhaps rather than having the roll apply to what type of clue you'll find in a given scene, it should determine how the clue you're currently pursuing as you begin the scene should be interpreted. <br/><br/>Again, thanks. It's good to have confirmed that I've got something worth pursuing further.<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>

                            The Closed Door<br/>by Roger Carbol<br/>sheet by Zach Welhouse and Darcy Burgess<br/><br/>Playability: 6<br/>Sheet Integration: 3<br/>Coolness: 6<br/>Total: 15<br/><br/>The presentation of The Closed Door is what grabbed me.  The entire text is<br/>presented as a dialog between a lead player and her playgroup.  Within that<br/>context, Roger presents his game particularly clearly.  In general the game is<br/>relatively simple: the characters are locked in a room in Hell, recounting<br/>their sins and sitting in judgment over one another.  A simple dice mechanic<br/>relates the forgiving or damning qualities of the characters to the burden of<br/>each other's guilt. <br/><br/>My reservations about The Closed Door as a game are that I'm not sure the <br/>mechanics would be very engaging.  Characters are mechanically the same from <br/>the beginning of the game, and nothing relates their qualities, or even their <br/>sins to anything systemic.  Ultimately, I imagine that the game would devolve <br/>into serial monologues, tied together by an interesting theme.<br/><br/>The tie to the sheet is quite weak, and Roger admits as much in his game text.  <br/>The boxes labeled Burden and Hunger are the only features that are really <br/>used.  There's a reach at using the Threads blanks that never quite pans out, <br/>any the phrase "What has been sealed away?" is echoed within the game text <br/>once.  Sadly, the huge, sexy maze in the middle of the sheet serves no <br/>purpose.<br/><br/>I love the idea of using this sheet as a metaphor for damned souls in Hell, <br/>and that's certainly an idea I want to see developed.  As it stands I wouldn't <br/>be very interested in playing The Closed Door, but I'll look for it's <br/>successor with interest.                        </div>

                            11th Hour<br/>by Mark Nau<br/>sheet by Mendel Schmiedekamp<br/><br/>Playability: 7<br/>Sheet Integration: 9<br/>Coolness: 7<br/>Total: 23<br/><br/>I'll be completely frank, by bias leans against 11th hour for a really stupid <br/>reason: Spavik pronouns.  Throughout, generic third person singular pronouns <br/>are this weird version of "they" with the "th" dropped.  Reads like typos from <br/>the start.  Mark, if you're not grinding an axe, can I respectfully suggest <br/>normal English pronouns?<br/><br/>Snarkiness aside, 11th hour is a really neat, late night horror movie kind of <br/>an idea.  Everyone plays the harsh antagonist of the player on their left, and <br/>to start merely teases at their character's wrongdoings.  Over the course of <br/>12 turns, the players frame scenes to expose the evil of each other's <br/>characters and attempt to press weaken them for the final confrontation.  <br/>Halfway though, everything turns nightmarish.  At the end of the game, there's <br/>a sort of a showdown where people get essentially eaten by the clock that's <br/>the central conceit of the game.<br/><br/>The concept is really cool, and it uses the sheet to good effect.  (My only <br/>quibble with the sheet is that one blank is always filled in "Guest" which <br/>seems like kind of a waste.)  I especially like the way the sheet turns around <br/>at 11:30 and roles shift.  I worry a little bit that the way the card <br/>mechanics work: players could be left without cards, and there's no recourse <br/>for that.  More worrying, the final showdown seems really random.  Ultimately, <br/>the cleverness of the cards gets overwhelmed by a really variable card play at <br/>the end.  Mark makes it clear he's not sure that it works.<br/><br/>There's a strong potential in this game, and I'd like to see the results of <br/>further development of this game.                        </div>

                            Ok, here are my votes for the character sheets:<br/><br/>most intimidating sheet - Roger Carbol. Not that there's anything intrinsically<br/>intimidating about the female reproductive system, but as a character sheet?!<br/>what do you do with that?!<br/><br/>crunchiest sheet - Joshua Bishop Roby. Bubblegum and robotix? As character<br/>stats? Rock on!<br/><br/>most exciting - Jason Sims. The bullseye! The guns! The text! I DEFY anyone to<br/>not make a cool game out of this sheet.<br/><br/>most likely to succeed - Matthijs Holter. On the one hand, it's really<br/>intimidating to just have an arrow and the word death on it. On the other hand,<br/>I think it really frees the desigener to incorporate it into any game he damn<br/>well pleases. So many possibilities, so many good game designs.<br/><br/>best design - Jon Walton. I adore the glyphs, the constellations and the big ol'<br/>figure on the right hand side.

It seems that some of the voters aren't taking part in the threads. At least, I'm hoping that's the case as I haven't seen anyone post their votes/reviews of my game "Mazes of Merphae." I trust they've sent their votes to Kevin.                        </div>

<b>Sheet votes</b>:<br/><br/><b>1. Most intimidating sheet: Roger Carbol</b><br/>As a collaborator in the making of two babies, I'm not intimidated by the female reproduction system as such. Having said that, I don't know what I would have done with this sheet.<br/><br/>I think I had a nightmare the day before the sheet assignments were released that I got Roger's sheet. I'm sure I woke up in a cold sweat.<br/><br/>I mean no offense at all by any of this. It was a well laid out and memorable sheet...but I'm glad I didn't get it!<br/><br/><b>2. Crunchiest sheet: Jeff Moore</b><br/>Equations! Boxes! Arrows! Experience! That d10 octagon!<br/><br/>I know the ultimate crunchiness would have come to fruition in the rules, but this sheet seemed a good launching pad for a crunchy game.<br/><br/><b>3. Most exciting: Martin O'leary</b><br/>I'm pretty sure that before I had the nightmare about Roger's sheet, I had a blissful dream of  Russian robots, facial hair and vodka. Had there been a draft, this would have been the sheet I would have wanted.<br/><br/><b>4. Most likely to succeed: Ashok Desai</b><br/>I loved the unity of this sheet. Everything seemed to fit together logically and thematically with no frills or fat. Looked like it was torn out of the back of a finished book.<br/><br/><b>5. Best design in a sheet: Matthijs Holter</b><br/>I am a sucker for minimalism. Loved the texture of that arrow and openess of the design. This would have been my second choice in a sheet-draft.                        </div>

No problem.  Should have been done sooner.  Regarding the pronouns, I am curious about your take on them.  I did a little research, 'cause I'd never seen the damned things before, which suggested that their probable source was either MU* play or math papers.  What's the appeal?                        </div>

I haven't done any "sit down and type out rules for a game" type game design in years. Last time I did, I was playing a nomic, and the style in that nomic was to use Spivak pronouns. A page and a half into typing out my thoughts on "11th hour," I realized I had slipped into Spivak. So I let it stay.

                            Better slightly late than never.<br/><br/>Review of: <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/growingpainsANDREWKENRICK.pdf" rel="nofollow">Growing Pains</a>, by Andrew Kenrick (Sheet by <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Joe%20Prince.pdf" rel="nofollow">Joe Prince</a>)<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Playability: 6</span></b><br/>The game definitely feels like it's got some solid ideas behind it.  It took me <br/>a while to wrap my head around some of the concepts that seemed <br/>counter-intuitive to me at first - "succeeding makes you <b>more</b> angsty, and puts <br/>things under strain?"  In the end, though, I can see how that's meant to <br/>reinforce genre.  <br/><br/>This is one I really wish I'd managed to get a chance to play, rather than <br/>simply going on impressions from reading the rules.  As it stands, though... I'm <br/>not convinced the mechanics quite work out, and there seem to be some that are <br/>missing.  For example - despite the suggestion that, in the end game scene, the <br/>heroes will probably all need to work together, I can't sort out how "combining <br/>efforts" works except for how it's reflected by the Relationship dice for the <br/>team.  <br/><br/>I'm also not sure whether, given the predictability and stability of Montage <br/>scenes in getting your Transformation score down, it's too easy to manage that <br/>number.  (Also, what happens if a Hero's Angst minus Transformation is less <br/>than a d4, once they've Transformed? do they simply not get Transformation <br/>dice?)<br/><br/>Lastly, it feels like there's something missing - the big climactic end-game <br/>scene, if I'm reading it right, gets run just about the same as most of the <br/>other scenes, which seem to be a scene-level stakes-setting (though that's not <br/>spelled out precisely, it seems fairly clear) that's resolved by one die roll.  <br/>Sure, you can narratively add to it by bringing in Powers, etc, but... well... <br/>for a Climax, I'd want to zoom in on the action, and without clearer, <br/>fine-grained consequences (crunch, basically) the system doesn't support doing <br/>so except through narrative license.<br/><br/>It feels like the game's structure will work best with a certain shared mindset <br/>in play, but doesn't necessarily reward that mindset directly enough to <br/>encourage it.  I can see how it'd sing if played "right" but it also feels easy <br/>to play it "wrong" - why would you risk putting something In Peril?  I suppose <br/>that's where the Nemesis player comes in, forcing those conflicts.<br/><br/>To sum up - good bones, some holes, some weak spots.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integration: 9</span></b><br/>About all I can say feels like it's missing is a use for "kill-count," which <br/>seems out of flavor for this anyhow, and a "reason" for the top three <br/>Transformation numbers to be white.  (Andrew covered the bottom three Angst <br/>being white nicely, as a threshhold level, but Transformation can't be <br/>successfully rolled, by the rules, until it's at 8 or below, if I read it <br/>right.)<br/><br/>Nice work getting it all in, making it work, and fitting things together.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coolness: 8</span></b><br/>This really does aim for a genre - it feels like TV serial teenage action.  <br/>While you definitely could do the "Power Rangers/Buffy" hybrid that Andrew <br/>discusses, and that's pretty nifty (the end portion even has a section titled <br/>"Minions, Monsters, and Megafauna"), what really jazzes me about it is that, <br/>with a few relatively minor tweaks beyond the general polishing of the system, <br/>this could turn into a Voltron RPG - with freakin' mechanical support for not <br/>forming the Blazing Sword until the end of the game!  How cool is that?  80's <br/>serial action TV angst fun.<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total: 23/30</span></b><br/><br/>Feedback:<br/>Andrew - if you're looking to continue this, and develop it, go for it.  There's <br/>potential in here.  One immediate suggestion - and I think I've got others, but <br/>want to chew on 'em a bit more - is this:  Empower the nemesis player to really <br/>make things rough.  Don't <b>roll</b> the nemesis dice for threat counters; just give <br/>'em the maximum value.  After all, if the nemesis gets a 1 or a 2, it's not <br/>gonna be a particularly surprise-filled evening.  I think those threat counters <br/>are the gold nugget hiding at the end of the game, the piece that keeps things <br/>from being too predictable and too much under the players' control.<br/><br/>- D.J.                        </div>

You could pick this up and play it, I think, and only run into a few minor hiccups.<br/> <br/>I think some of the â€œscaleâ€ factors regarding speed and so on might warrant re-thinking, since I donâ€™t think that at the rates of movement given thereâ€™s any real chance of a dream-bubble significantly shifting its altitude during the duration of a dream.  (Either that, or Ash is envisioning a different time-scale between dreaming and the waking world, which is probably a topic that could use some discussion anyhow in case a character is â€œawokenâ€ or a dreamer is in danger of waking before the players finish something.)<br/><br/>It feels like rules or at least advice for how to handle the waking world could be nice, if only in the sense that were I running a game of this, the temptation to have a little bit of crossover into the waking world for contrast or story reasons could add a whole lot.  I donâ€™t think they need to add stats or be complex; the three main ones could cross over pretty easily.  I can see why this wasnâ€™t there, but it does feel like at least a mention would make sense.<br/><br/>The only real oddity I felt was that, if everyoneâ€™s strongly encouraged to take â€œSoarâ€ â€“ why isnâ€™t it just a freebie that everyone gets?  Seems limiting to the point of unplayability not to have it, and to take away a choice and some variety not to get it.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m not sure the pools of starting dice are quite high enough â€“ Iâ€™d be tempted to give out a few more, maybe 9 total, but to cap starting stats at 5 or something.  Characters would be a touch more powerful, but it just feels like the sample character would have a fair bit of trouble getting much done.  I think that one needs to be played out to see, thoughâ€¦  Iâ€™ll see about doing so.<br/><br/>Lastly, thereâ€™s no character advancement system or other feedback/reward system, which means that other than the sheer joy of play and story-related goals (and those could be enough) thereâ€™s nothing to drive play itself.  Is that needed?  I donâ€™t know, but it would help long-term play to have something, I think.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integration: 10</span></b><br/>All the elements are there, the feel is there, everything clicks as the â€œrightâ€ sort of word for what it does in the Reverieâ€¦ Not much to say, as the sheet mostly gave off â€œmoodâ€ rather than crunch, but boy, does this take that mood/color and run.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coolness: 10</span></b><br/>Dude, dream-bubble physics, past life recall, ancestral memory, manipulating the seeds of inspiration, free-asssociative control over dream symbolism, the possibility for bigger story mixed into one funky head-trip of a dream-hopping experience, power over individual sorts of things that reminds me a little of Nobilis mixed with a definite â€œhumanâ€ experience and the wonder of dreamsâ€¦  I so want to play this, or run this.  <br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total: 28/30</span></b><br/><br/>Feedback:<br/>Holy cow is this dripping with setting and color, and in just 22 pages I can already get a sense for how I might set up and start playing a medium-arc or long-arc story.

                            Thanks for the review, this should prove very useful for the early revisions.

Hmm point taken... I wasn't really envisioning a dream's altitude changing that much in the course of a session, but from that point of view you may be right. Let's see, it should sort things out if I treble the standard values so that a fast dream can approach nearly 200mph.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meej</cite>It feels like rules or at least advice for how to handle the waking world could be nice, if only in the sense that were I running a game of this, the temptation to have a little bit of crossover into the waking world for contrast or story reasons could add a whole lot.

The problem I personally have with this is that the three main stats don't really have any relation to the real world, excepting Mojo which would end up being used for anything. Otherwise I'd have to end up making a whole different set of statistics for real-world interaction which (of course) wouldn't be on the character sheet which wouldn't be fair for the game. I shall certainly think about inlcuding rules for the waking world in the expanded print edition after the competition is over, as there are already a few things that I want to add.

Mostly it's a choice thing. You don't actually need soar to move from bubble to bubble. You can get someone WITH soar to carry you, or you could do what Squirrel does which is to sprog off a tiny little bubble to fly around in and stick it to another bubble that you want to enter. Soar is just the easiest method of getting around.

Originally it was going to be 10, but I felt that might be a bit too powerful. I'll have another look at that section. Incidentally, the main reason I didn't include character advancement is that there isn't an awful lot to advance so player characters could become either very powerful very quickly, or would progress so slowly that they hardly seemed to be changing at all. Again I can certainly think about changing that.<br/><br/>Ash                        </div>

Thanks DJ! I am indeed looking to develop this further, and in fact managed a playtest of it the other day. I'll post a report over the weekend, but in short some things worked (surprisingly, the pacing of angst/transformation did, as did the vibe and flavour I was pushing for), and some things didn't (the overt division of the game into scenes, the reducing angst by transformation to calculate the bonus die for transformation, and there was never the incentive to do anything more than put something under threat rather than in peril). <br/><br/>Thanks again for the feedback - if you have any more comments or suggestions, please let me know!                        </div>

                            Thank you for the feedback, Eric. During the crunchtime for Empire's first draft, I considered scrapping bits of the sheet because they were clashing with my vision of the world. It looks like my problems were accurately reflected in your review. As for playtesting, I look forward to that day.                        </div>

                            And here is my final review, for the game based on my sheet. As a result I have probably been a little harsher than I would to another sheet, so bear that in mind when reading!<br/><br/>Cubit<br/>Game by Carl Muckenhoupt<br/>Sheet by Andrew Kenrick<br/><br/>Carlâ€™s game of cubical mechanical constructs (modrons, anyone?) turns out to be an interesting interpretation on my own sheet. Whilst the sheet isnâ€™t used even vaguely like Iâ€™d imagined, Iâ€™m not sure thatâ€™s a bad thing.<br/><br/>Playability â€“ 6<br/><br/>The game seems more or less playable by as written, except for the fun, if largely unworkable idea of rolling miniatures instead of dice. The reliance on the game on the tactical positioning of your character (represented by the cubical character sheet) for every single skill check, not just combat, complicates things to an unnecessary level, although Iâ€™m sure there are ways round this.<br/><br/>A lesser flaw is that in part Carl has lavished too much attention in the wrong places â€“ thereâ€™s plenty of information on the lifecycle of a cubit (which borders on rules at times, without explicitly saying as much), but only throwaway remarks as to what you might do in the game.<br/><br/>Integration of Sheet â€“ 6<br/><br/>This is where my bias has to come to the fore, Iâ€™m afraid. As the sheetâ€™s designer I am in a position to compare the game as written to the game Iâ€™d imagined coming from my sheet. Cubit is utterly unlike anything Iâ€™d imagine to have come from my sheet, which both helps and hinders it.<br/><br/>On the one hand the sheet itself is integrated very well into the game â€“ after all, the cube sheet is the character, in more ways than one. But, on the other hand, half of the text on the sheet (â€œroll your sheet!â€) is ignored entirely!<br/><br/>Cool Factor â€“ 7<br/><br/>Playing cubical mechanical creations in a strange geometrical landscape, represented with a character sheet that is also a miniature? Excellent! <br/><br/>Using dice for minis and minis for dice? Absolutely bonkers, but had me giggling in amusement and excitement all the same!<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>An interesting, if a little rough around the edges (sorry, sorry), game that has some very good ideas. A little less reliance on miniature representation and a little more guidance for GMs would help a great deal.<br/><br/>Total - 19                        </div>

Actually, I believe 'roll your sheet' was the inspiration for using the sheet as a miniature.  In play, you actually *do* 'roll your sheet', so in context it just means, 'go play the game!'

Fair point, I'd overlooked that. The manner in which the miniatures move is indeed called rolling.                        </div>

                            So yesterday my lovely wife Danielle found herself looking over the sheets. And as a non-participant, per Kevin's rules, her votes can't count. But she's an awesome gamer, gamemaster, and aspiring designer, so I thought folks might appreciate seeing her choices:<br/><br/><b>Most intimidating:</b> Eva Schiffer<br/><br/><b>Crunchiest:</b> Eric Downton<br/><br/><b>Most exciting:</b> Jason Sims<br/><br/><b>Most likely to succeed:</b> Aaron Caskey<br/><br/><b>Best design:</b> Tomas HV MÃ¸rkrid<br/><br/>And then we had a conversation about which sheet she'd have chosen as the basis for a game design if she'd been participating and the endeavor had been a draft. And she picked Jason Morningstar's sheet. Which was interesting, because in the abstract I'd have guessed that most designers would choose the sheet they voted "most exciting." But in a draft you want to pick a sheet that inspires you and suits your creative strengths. <br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            Forgot to post this when I posted the other review. Duh!<br/><br/>Game: <b>Etherium</b><br/>Designer: Thom Foster <br/>Sheet by: Kirk Mitchell<br/><br/><b>Premise:</b><br/>Those who sleep and those whose spirits will not rest meet in the realm of dreams.  A mostly drama-resolution, freeform-ish, evocative game that, against my hopes, fails to fulfill its promise.<br/><br/><b>Playability: 4</b><br/>Etherium walks a delicate path.  Its creator wants it to be playable by anyone, even people who have never played a roleplaying game before.  But at the same time, the game is deeply evocative instead of structured and clear.<br/><br/>At its core, Etherium features drama resolution with a die only to be used to determine who gets to narrate the setup and who gets to resolve conflicts.  That's it for rules.  Everything else in the game has no mechanical value and is meant to be used for inspiration for scenes, conflicts, etc.  The evocative writing helps experienced players to set up neat characters, but it does not help at all with situation creation, what to do in the game, how to help pace or structure the game, etc.  Anyone without any roleplaying experience is likely to fall flat on their faces trying to come up with a good game session.  Sure, they could probably narrate a thing or two, but the lack of direction--in parts stemming from the refusal to say things without the dream-like confusing tone of the game text--will leave most people hanging.<br/><br/>Now, it is possible to make a drama-resolution-based, coherent, playable game out of this that could actually be played as a "first game," but it would need a lot of work.<br/><br/><b>Sheet Integration: 3</b><br/>Many of this game's main character aspects (Phobias, Themela, symbols) aren't even on the sheet.  Sure, Thom somewhat incorporated the sheet into the game, but overall it looks like there was a game here that was superimposed on the sheet, and the result is that the core information of the characters is nowhere written down.  Take away the sheet and its parts out of the game and 95% of the game would still be the same.<br/><br/><b>Coolness Factor: 8</b><br/>I enjoyed reading the game and loved the evocative flavor.  But I'm also someone with 11+ years of freeform play experience who could easily play this as written using my experience and techniques I've learned.  That said, the mechanics don't add anything that I couldn't play out in freeform, character-ownership games.  What the game really does is provide you with inspiring little snippets to develop interesting characters.  So while the evocative aspects of the game are really cool--especially all the poetic touches and symmetries throughout (such as poems that are mirrored like hour glasses)--there isn't much "game" here.<br/><br/><b>Total Score: 15</b><br/>Cool overall, but doesn't have much to do with the sheet and needs a lot more work.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lpsmith</cite>Actually, I believe 'roll your sheet' was the inspiration for using the sheet as a miniature. In play, you actually *do* 'roll your sheet', so in context it just means, 'go play the game!' (see<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1350&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">his post</a>in the "Rev/Eng -- Look Back in [insert emotion]" thread.)</blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: andrew_kenrick</cite>Fair point, I'd overlooked that. The manner in which the miniatures move is indeed called rolling.</blockquote>
There is also one other point in the game where the sheet is physically rolled. Here's a direct quote:
<blockquote><cite>Cubit RPG</cite>When combat starts, lay out the battlefield and put all the cubits in the positions they would be in. A cubit that is ready for battle can choose its orientation. A cubit that's been taken by surprise, and has no compelling reason to be in any particular orientation when surprised, should be rolled like a die to determine its starting orientation.</blockquote>
I agree that this is mechanically weak though, compared to actually using the character sheet as a die to determine all skill test outcomes.<br/><br/>Ash                        </div>

<em>Danielle is obviously a fantastic person!</em><br/><br/>I certainly think so. (And her choice wasn't subconsciously influenced by having enjoyed playing the Roach at Forge Midwest either, because she was looking at sheets without names on them.)<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>
