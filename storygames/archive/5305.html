It's the most exciting town write-up I've ever run across - Dogs turned up to 11, with prisoners of war, Reavers, demons disguised as angels, and the Antichrist due to be born in about nine hours time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've put a copy of Moreno's write-up below. Hopefully he's cool with me doing this, but I'm hoping to draw on the collective wisdom of Story Games to flesh Armageddon out a bit.  Personally, I feel like there are probably some more factions in the town that want things from the Dogs (and I've put down an example of one after the write-up).  If you've got any other ideas for people, situations, or anything at all after reading this, I'd love to hear them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to run this town at Kapcon this weekend, so I'd appreciate your take on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>ARMAGEDDON</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>PRIDE</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSister Mariah thinks that she is so without sin, without any doubt, and so pretty, that she will be a saint of the faith someday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>INJUSTICE</b><br/>\n<br/>\nShe become the jewel of the city for the Steward and the headfamilies. Everybody else get ignored of at least put-down, everybody is judged by their parent/teachers/husbands/ against her example.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo everybody begin to hate her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SIN</b><br/>\n<br/>\nDeceit: some people begin to play a cruel prank on her. They let her believe that she has "miraculous" powers, they tell her that they have some disease, they let her put her hands on their heads, and they tell her that they are cured afterward. Poor Mariah isn't too bright and believe everything she is told.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlasphemy and Apostasy: someone goes too far with this prank. They begin to mockingly "venerate" her in secret ceremonies in the church at night. She believes that they were told to do so by angels of the lord, for his mysterious ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>DEMONIC ATTACK</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe demons answers to these ceremonies. They make the "prank" a reality. She really begins to "cure" diseases (brought by the demons themselves, that have only to leave to "heal" them). The people who weren't on the prank believe her.  And after a while, even the people who did the prank begin to believe that it was the truth, after all, and call for her forgiveness. She forgive them, because they showed to her hers "real Powers".<br/>\n<br/>\nFalse "Angels" (Demons in disguise) begin to talk to her, telling her what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>FALSE DOCTRINE</b><br/>\n<br/>\nPeople (and even the Steward) believe that she is a saint, and everybody goes to her ceremonies. Almost everybody in the city become a cultist, many of them possessed. Almost everybody of them get real powers. Many of them can dominate the mind of others, can bend reality, or can read minds. When they use these powers they appears as bright angels burning in white flames.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SORCERY</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWith so many possessed people, the demons can do the innominable: they told Mariah do do a very important ceremony. In this ceremony, an Angel of the lord arrived and joined with her in blessed light. At the end of the ceremony, she is pregnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer son is the Antichrist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>HATE AND MURDER</b><br/>\n<br/>\n"people forgot the real word of the lord", said the "angels". So they must be punished. They must be killed. But to save them from an eternity in hell, they have to be "cleansed" with a special ceremony that will make them worthy of paradise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people of the city change its name. Now it's called "Armageddon". They storm the nearest cities, capturing all the peoples, taking them to Armageddon where they are tortured and killed, one by one, for weeks and months, until they die or they renounce the King of Life (at this time they, crazy and deranged from the tortures - think "Reavers" from the telefilm Firefly - they join the cultist)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are creating an army. An army of burning bright angels with superpowers, of "Reavers" that want to skin you alive, of crazed fanaticians armed with magic guns that never miss their target, of Sorcerer that can commands hundreds of demons. For when the Boy will be born. At this time, they will destroy all the faithful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere goes the Dogs. The were called here by the King of Life, with omens, dreams and holy signs. They know that the boy will be born at Midnight, before they will be able to call any help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>WHAT PEOPLE WANT</b><br/>\nSister Mariah want the dogs at her side. Aren't they as the three sage men who were there at another epiphany?<br/>\nThe "Reavers" want to torn them limb from limb<br/>\nThe Demons want to kill them, but they can't if Mariah order them to don't do it. They find it difficult, too, because the Vest on the dogs prevent the readings of their minds or the use or any powers against them directly. They have to use deceit, or threat against the people they are still in cage awaiting torture and death.<br/>\nThe last free person to flee from the demons, that the dogs meet on their way to the city, tell them everything and say to them that, for the good of humanity, they have to kill the mother and child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>WHAT IF THE DOGS NEVER COME</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIf the boy is born, the vest will not protect them anymore (give them a sign about this). All the faithful in all the world will be killed or turned. The Human Race will forget forever the King of Life. The King of Life will burn all the world with a terrible cleansing fire that will left nobody alive. The Demons will laugh for eternity.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** *** ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I thought of after reading this was that there are probably PRISONERS who want things from the dogs: to be freed, to flee the town, to be put out of their misery.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure if there's more than one sorcerer, either.  Is Mariah the only one capable of commanding the demons?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this sparks any other ideas for people, or situations, or anything at all in you, I'd love to hear them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119430/#Comment_119430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T10:54:04+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 10:54AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woah, yeah it sparks. In particular because the Dog I am currently playing is just such a "prodigal son"--groomed by most of the Town from childhood to be a Dog. I wanna play Mariah! (How would Dog-as-source-of-sin work, anyhow? Just Dog-on-Dog challenges, ya?)<br><br>The only "issue" I can imagine with this setup is that it's going to be cut-and-dried, given the "open" nature of information in the Town write-up (and in DitV play in general). I see the Dogs showing up and--short of Mariah providing a temporary respite by ordering the Reavers to stand down--the Dogs just opening fire with both barrels, putting down anyone and everyone they find on the streets (presuming there are no "free range Prisoners"). Where's your moral quandary, here? It's a town chock full of Demons and Sin: the Dogs might as well roll in with Gatling guns and dynamite sticks and put the whole place to the torch, mowing down any who try to escape.<br><br>I mean... this is a branch so badly in need of culling that almost any amount of collateral damage ought to be treated as acceptable by all but the most pacifist of Dogs. And the risk of a Reaver "slipping through" to re-start the whole she-bang is too great. MAYBE you could inject some kind of serious motivation to spare Mariah... but I don't see how, myself--abortion of the Antichrist, followed by exorcism, then Reaver-slaying your way out of town before the wired dynamite blows it sky-high?<br><br>Could such an "all or nothing" town actually break DitV play, as written? Just food for thought from...<br>David<br>(Oh, and by definition, any Reaver who has "powers" is commanding a demon. Thus, by your write-up, almost all of the town can command demons.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119452/#Comment_119452" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T12:01:03+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 12:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, you've pointed out what's been niggling at me here.

Sure, the Demons would like you to believe it is, but it's just a baby, for God's sake.  I'm not sure how to get this across to the players -- prophetic dreams and such seem like they break the principles of the game.  But if they need to save the baby, it would make the game a bit more interesting.  <br><br>What I'm thinking is that this would be a cool ending to a DitV campaign, with some editing.  The Dogs return to Bridal Falls city and discover that in the meantime, the Church has been corrupted and the Mariah cult has taken over the heart of it -- but aside from her and her guard of Reavers and cultists, much of the town is still unaffected, too horrified to speak out, too afraid of bringing the jackbooted foot of authority down on the Faith.  <br><br>In this case, sure the Dogs can go in with fire and dynamite and leave not one stone standing on another -- but that's a surgery that kills the patient -- the survivors will be dispirited and the Faith will collapse on itself.  This also brings out one of the game's nagging contradictions -- the Council of Elders is in good with the King of Life and knows what is right, but at the same time they send the Dogs out to make the laws in remote towns with very little supervision.  What happens when the Dogs come back from their long travel and can't reconcile themselves with the Council of Elders decrees?<br><br>I could picture a satisfying denouement where the Dogs gun down most of the Elders, leaving a couple righteous ones to rebuild, and then scatter -- one goes back East, one disappears into the desert, one lets himself get shot down leaving town.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119488/#Comment_119488" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T13:36:00+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  1:36PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who's the father?<br><br>I mean, yeah, demons, but who's the father <i>for real</i>?<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119512/#Comment_119512" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T15:10:25+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  3:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, wait, wait... kill the whole town, no questions asked?

I never played it, to tell the truth (so I would really be interested in hearing from you how it went, after Kapcon. And from anybody who ever played it). I trusted the DitV system to be able to deal even with this level of opposition, and even after all this time (and having played lots more of DitV) I think it will work, as a town write-up, but you have to make Armageddon "yours" to make it work. Not "yours" for you as a person, but for you as a group of players (even if you just meet for the game at a convention). <br><br>What I mean? Well, I am talking about the way Dogs towns are build, after the first one (and Armageddon is a "end of the story" town, I think, not a beginning one). the "So, you dogs think this? even in this case? Or in this one?" question from the GM (formulated by a town), and the way the supernatural dial is set by all the group together during the game.<br><br>If Armageddon were to be played at the end of a regolar group stint with DitV, you would have an already-set supernatural dial, and some question to be answered by the dogs. Maybe in a previous town some dogs judged a child always innocent for the sins of his parents. So, you would use Armageddon to ask him "even THIS child? Even the antichrist?". Or maybe they didn't kill anybody in cold blood, unarmed. Or maybe in the previues towns they simply murdered anybody who sinned, and in this case you would fill Armageddon with a lot a well-meaning people who believe that the child will bring about a new heaven on earth (and you would drop the torture and the reavers, keeping only the bright angels. Or, if you want to keep the reavers, they could be explained to the well-meaning  town people as poor victims od demonmic attacks). Would they kill hundreds of innocents to purge the Sin from Armageddon?<br><br>About the supernatural dial: in my forum post it was puhed up over any limit (it was the point of the thread), but if you play this city (or any city) with a specific group of players, you would have to follow the group unstated (but clear) guidelines about the amount of "special effects" in the game.<br><br>Could Armageddon be played without any "special effect"? I think it could. Use dreams, visions from mad people, cut down on reavers and bright angels (apart from dreams or children tales) and fill Armageddon with mundane fanatics (or with well-meaning young folks with big clear eyes full of hope: add some weary-eyed couple with a very ill small child that they want to show to Mariah to pray to her to save him).<br><br>I didn't flesh out any of the town other residents (I only precised that Mariah want the dogs to join her army, not to kill them, because without this the town risk becoming only a big fight), but if you play Armageddon less "flashy" and with more character interaction, you should fill it with characters. Old relationships of the characters that got sucked in the cult. Maybe someone the dogs saved in a previus city telling them to go and change their ways, and now they joined with Mariah and tell the dogs that they were right and going there saved his/her soul. And the people who first made the first prank and it'a orrified to see what he/she started. The very pius mother of mariah, and the boy who always was in love with mariah and now follow her even if he know the truth, to save her. And, as Ben said, don't forget the child's "true" father....<br><br>Playing at a convention you don't have the luxury of having all these questions and dials set for you in the previus towns, but the kind of characters they do could be a good indication of how to "finetune" Armageddon for them.<br><br>Just remember: It's the end of the world, and eveything depend on the dogs: but what they meet when they enter Armageddon should be a replection of what they did in their life. And "kill mother and child and save the day" should not be an easy answer (or not be the answer, at all: for example, what if the murder of the mother would simply leave all the other sorcerers free to break havok, as she is the only one who still keep them under control. And the act from the antichrist that will destroy the world would only be her death in childbirth?)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120253/#Comment_120253" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:39:06+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:39PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, that's great stuff!
