Play for prizes!<br/><br/>Warning: Rambling<br/>Two, a game of lost connections. Each player would have someone else as their connection to the other world (whether this be a psychic plane, another planet, or Heaven, I don't know), but they wouldn't know who they were. Each player would also have a possession - red scarf, smoke pipe, etc. - written on their sheet, as well as the possession that their connection has. Finally, each player would have a message for their connection, if they meet them. A player can lure someone else's connection to them with the other person's possession - "I know where someone is that has a red scarf! Let's go!" Bring a connection together and bam! You get points, and they get to meet each other. So, introduce the lost connections back to each other. The player then goes and gets another possession and and can find another connection. Each connection made gives the player a new clue as to their identity. What weird character will you turn out to be?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144236/#Comment_144236" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T13:33:21+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's an improv exercise where you pair up.

If 70 Owlbears show up, you can either do a huge group thing (like a stand-up introduction, or singing, whatever) or you can break into smaller groups.  If you have small groups, you need to organize some way to shift folks around regularly in order to make sure everybody gets a chance to meet.<br/><br/>Alternately, you could do a story-games version of the classic "Two Truths One Lie" icebreaker, where you split folks up into small groups and they take turns presenting three "facts" about themselves, while the others try to determine which of the three is a lie.  Afterwards, they introduce one another to the larger group, based on on what they now know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144241/#Comment_144241" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T13:47:59+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:47PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we should force everyone to meet everyone.

I'm pretty sure they were more coherent the first time... Note to self: always type long comments in a text file first.)<br/><br/>I've worked in a lot of day/overnight camps, and there are several different ways we force people to get to know each other. Usually, on the first day/night, we do some big group games. The idea of these is not that you'll actually get to know everyone else, but rather that you will gain some degree of familiarity with everyone so that actually getting to know them more at a later time (like in the mess hall) is less intimidating. Most big group games work on the format of "big circle of chairs with everyone sitting around, person in the middle who has some sort of power to make people move around, person in the middle tries to steal a seat and leave someone else stuck in the middle." Fruit basket is the classic one of these. The idea, from a get to know you standpoint, is that, in a circle, you can see everyone else in the circle, so they become more familiar to you. Moving around makes you sit next to different people, and switching up the middle person allows you to spotlight many different people for just enough time that their faces/voices become somewhat familiar. My favorite circle game for teen camps (which I think would work well with adults, too) is "Darling if you love me won't you please please smile?"<br/>Basic rules:<br/>The person in the middle chooses someone in the circle and approaches them. Without touching them, but using whatever facial contortions, funny voices, and creative twists they want, they quote the above phrase to their chosen target. The chosen "darling" must respond with the phrase, "Darling, you know I love you, but I just can't smile." If they so much as grin while attempting to quote the response, they get stuck in the middle, and have to find a new target of their own.<br/><br/>There are also many circle games that incorporate names. You'd be surprised how quickly you can learn 70 people's names when you need to know names to win a game. But names don't create such a lasting impression as someone contorting their face to make you smile, which is why I chose to elaborate on that game instead.<br/><br/>The second type of big group game is the mingle game. Usually designed somewhat around the musical chairs format, you get everyone moving around, "mingling" as it were, while the music plays, and then, when the music stops, they have to do something. My favorite mingle game is, um, I don't think I have a name for it. Basically, when the music stops, the leader will call out a number and a shape. At that point, the minglers need to get into groups of that number of people and figure out a way to use their bodies to make that shape. As the leader, I like to start with easy things, like "Three, triangle" and work my way up to things like "Six, grandfather clock" or "Eight, nirvana." You only have a small amount of time together as a group, but a decent amount of bonding goes on while you're trying to figure out whose arm should be the pendulum, or whether you should make a rock band or an alternate plane of existence. The group that makes the best/fastest/coolest (criteria somewhat loose) shape wins that round. Give them stickers if you feel like it. Then put the music back on for the next round.<br/><br/>The other way that camps force interaction is through team events. This might seem obvious, but working together towards a common goal is a great way to get to know people. Personally, I tend to prefer games like capture the flag that have a strong strategy element, or games like group scavenger hunts that have a strong creative element, over games like soccer that are strictly physical. I feel like you get to know your teammates better crawling through the woods or trying to figure out where to find a green bandana, than on the field where communication is mostly about "pass it to me". But then again, maybe I'm biased because I suck at sports.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144831/#Comment_144831" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T09:11:41+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  9:11AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'd be particularly interested in hearing more ideas about games where you learn peoples' names.

I mean, the person organizing the games would know who had signed up, but their names wouldn't be posted, just whether the slots were filled or not. I know it might make the wiki organization a little more complicated, but I think people might be less likely to say, "Oh, so and so is playing that game, I'll sign up for it, too." And really, as several people have pointed out, the best way to get to know people is to play with them. It probably wouldn't work, but it's a thought.<br/><br/>As for names, there are plenty of summer camp style name games that could easily be adapted for Nerdly, if people were up for it. But honestly, I think just having larger print on the name tags would solve the name problem quicker than anything else. (Although I love the idea that someone posted on another thread of having polaroids for name-face recognition when you're trying to track down your GM.)<br/><br/>Oh, and a twist on the Bingo idea... what if everyone had a Bingo card with everyone's names, but you don't get to check them off unless you play a game with them.

We're all shy, man. We all know a couple of people, and then have to meet others. The only difference seems to be a sense that everyone will come over and introduce themselves to me if I hang back or go outside to smoke.</p>\n<p>This is a social event, where we can get together with people we like and meet the people that the people we like like. If you don't know anyone there and don't want to meet them, <em>why are you there?</em></p>\n<p>I propose this: at 01, there was the talent show. Pretty much everyone was there. We can organize that kind of thing, can't we? Let's have that be the focus of the meeting process, complete with polaroids (or a digital camera and printer. There's power. That shouldn't be a big problem) for reinforcement. I, for one, can't meet all that many people at once without names flying out of my head, so a board of photos would be really great. It would alleviate a lot of my name-forgetting anxiety.</p>\n<p>I want to second Jule Ann's name tag recommendation, too.
