This part was awesome. We ended up with the settlement known as Now Playing, a fortified Drive-in Theater where the Savyhead Joshua would play old movies in exchange for bits of tech and scrap that were salvaged from the nearby ruins, Dice and his Chopper gang running a protection racket on the local hardholder and the Ruby the Battlebabe who just quit working for the hardholder to protect a child she found.<br/><br/>When we got to the actual play portion of the session it was already pretty late at this point and I think a good part of the frustration that would follow was due to some low blood sugar on my part and I should have followed my gut and ended the night there.  I started the game out nice and slow a \u201cwhat happens when you wake up each morning question\u201d, I poked a bit and got some good color about the hardhold they live in and their various shelters, what they do for food and I Barfed Forth Apocalyptica all over their answers. Once this was established, I felt kinda adrift, like I didn't know where to go or what questions I should be asking of the players to generate the unbalanced situation or any of the stuff I would need to write fronts for later play. This led to some frustration and a lot of pauses on my part. We eventually stumbled on to a bit of conflict between the Ruby and the Dice's gang, and then ended the game. I think I was really missing something like a kicker or beliefs to zero my attention in on what the players wanted, which I know the 1st session is supposed to create as a result of play but I was really unsure of how to get there. <br/><br/>So as the MC what sort of questions should I be asking the players to generate situation? To those who have played it, what type of things have you asked? <br/>Should my prep prior to the 1st session have included some ideas as to NPC's? Because once the game started my mind was a blank slate regarding NPC or should I be asking pointed questions about the type of people the players know and deal with to create my NPC with? <br/><br/>I have some ideas about stuff I want to try, but these have definitely come out of thinking and mulling over things for a week. But procedurally what sort of things should I have been doing in that first session.<br/><br/>In the end the only thing I think I really nailed was Barfing Forth Apocalyptica, man I did that at every chance and I loved it. I think this came nice and easy due to the pre-game prep of essentially day dreaming up apocalyptic imagery and to start forming an aesthetic so I had stuff to draw on already or at least vague ideas and wants.<br/><br/>I am still really excited about this game, and between the book, blog and posts here I think I have a solid understanding of how the game works for everything except that 1st session bit.<br/><br/>- Colin                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265951/#Comment_265951" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T11:28:39+00:00" title="April  7, 2010 11:28AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin, I feel your pain.

The game rules say specifically NOT to create fronts for the first session. But there's little for the first-time MC to go by in the rules once the characters are created. Creating situation is fun, but if you aren't prepared to turn that situation into NPCs and strife on the fly, it can be dull. Or in my case, a clusterf*ck as I tried to jump towards conflict too soon.<br/><br/>Perhaps some of the more-experienced MCs like Harper will chime in with their thoughts and suggestions.<br/><br/>But I think this is definitely an area that could be expanded in the game rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265954/#Comment_265954" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T11:40:23+00:00" title="April  7, 2010 11:40AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2010 11:42AM by Kaare Berg.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was lucky. My players began straight off with a "shopping expedition" and from then on it was balls to the wall. The second session was a bit more slow, but there were also out-of-game reasons for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I feel you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked to the front sheets. Even if I weren't going to create a front I introduced situations based on what I found there. And threw it in my players faces. It is important to remember that you don't need to chuck conflicts at the players the first session, you got the rest of the campaign to do that. Just introduce npcs and places. Sprinkle some fuckery on it and watch which ones that take. The fuckery bit is as important as the barfing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, coming from a long time playing with Kickers and such with this delibrate slow start was kinda of a culture shock. I'd "forgotten" how to ease into things.<br/>\n<br/>\n*edited to include my final observation. Don't force conflicts on the players. Set them up, yeah. But don't push 'em. Have the characters seek them. Want and desperation are you to key words for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265955/#Comment_265955" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T11:41:27+00:00" title="April  7, 2010 11:41AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite>So as the MC what sort of questions should I be asking the players to generate situation?

That's what they're there for. You'll do the thing where you misdirect, etc., but first, just pick one that sounds good to you. <i>Announce future badness</i> and <i>Put someone in a spot</i> are favorites of mine.<br/><br/>Now you've picked a move, but you have to wrap it up in fiction. So you have to daydream a bit. Put someone in a spot... maybe someone taps the Savvyhead on the shoulder while he's working and he turns around to see a shotgun barrel in his face. "Surprise, fucker! Hand over the stuff." Now this guy with the shotgun needs a name and a dirt-simple motivation and that's about it. He's Cricket, the asshole scrounge-thief. You don't have to know any more than that. Ask the character what they do, call for rolls, make follow-up moves as needed.<br/><br/>If you do that for each PC you'll have a few grabby NPCs by the end and a growing sense of who the threats are. Try to stay in the present moment as much as possible and follow the fiction where it leads. Answer questions as they arise naturally. "How come this filthy scrounge-thief gets to just waltz in and out of our holding?" "Um.. because the hardholder is fucking him? That's the rumor. Supposedly it's hands-off when it comes to Cricket. What do you do?"<br/><br/>Like the book says, look for the places where they're not in control. You do this so you can tie your GM moves in to the fiction. You're <b>not</b> looking at the PCs through crosshairs! They'll feel like you are, of course, but that's because Apocalypse World is all brutality and scarcity and danger when you make it seem real. You're actually looking at the NPCs through crosshairs and figuring out how you can bring them down.<br/><br/>The secret voodoo of AW is this: Nothing brings down an NPC as fast or as well as sending them up against the PCs. Because, man, the PCs are fucking badasses. So, it might look like the GM is making the PC's lives harder by arranging all these threats against them, but really it's the other way around. Those threats are about to have their sorry little worlds permanently fucked by the PCs.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling now. Does that help at all? I can maybe say more if you have questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265959/#Comment_265959" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T11:54:14+00:00" title="April  7, 2010 11:54AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite>When we played I was really feeling the lack of NPC and was wondering at what sort of leading questions I could ask to generate them.</blockquote>\nI think a solid approach there is: introduce NPCs. Further, whenever a player mentions a background character off-hand, name them and breathe a bit of life into them. "Oh, you mean Sickly, right? Yeah, you're probably not the first person he's swindled, either. The guy's a total sleaze."<br/><br/>I don't think "follow them around for a day" translates into "introduce nothing".

Perhaps the key here is not to avoid conflicts but to keep them small and manageable. <br/><br/>In our first session I asked the Angel player "so you're sitting in the outhouse and you see Kilo coming at you, fists balled up and blood in his eyes- what did you do to piss him off?" the result was s small one-on-one scuffle that was more like a setup for later trouble.  Bringing out a whole gang armed for killing would be getting ahead of yourself.<br/><br/>As for NPCs, I think of them as part of the apocalyptica- what kind of people make the background of the holding?

I mean that both in the SG jargony way and also the plain English way.<br/><br/>Action and consequences -- that's what you do. "Conflict" is too abstract, too movie and stage, too neat and tidy. So, don't set up conflicts between characters (even though that's fun in other games). Don't think about how this could be in conflict with that. Don't think about how you can drive the game towards conflict. None of that.<br/><br/>Just have an NPC (who is not that complicated) take action toward getting something they want, or away from something they fear, or toward something they fear but still want. That NPC might be in a Front (by session two) and maybe one of that Front's countdowns ticks forward. Does anyone interfere? What happens then? And on like that, moves snowballing.<br/><br/>It's pedantic of me, I know. But trust me. Kill the word conflict dead when you play this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265986/#Comment_265986" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T14:38:11+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  2:38PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, if I can make it to Gen Con this year, I'm going to cash in all these thread discussions for a table demonstration of your Apocalypse-Fu.

It was: I only ever looked at the GM move list when someone missed a roll. Then I was like, "Oh! Now I get to pick one of these and make a hard move."<br/><br/>Instead, the GM moves are what you always say. Whenever you need to talk and you're not sure what you should say, you make a move. Cover it in fiction, misdirect, and barf apocalyptica on it (so it doesn't look like you're saying a move), of course. So the GM moves are constantly in play. I'd be hard pressed to think of anything I say during a game now that isn't one of those moves.<br/><br/>Like I said, maybe you already know this. It's something I had to remind myself of a lot for my first few sessions.<br/><br/>"The infirmary is an old burned-out bus that was stripped down and turned into a kind of metal shack. Used to be Dremmer's pad before he got marched out of the holding at gunpoint. Some big pieces of tin have been welded over the windows in places to keep the sun off you, but it leaks like a sieve and lets the hot wind off the burn flats blow right through -- shakes the whole thing and you don't want to be in there during a serious ash storm."<br/><br/>That's, like, three GM moves right there (announce future badness, announce off-screen badness x2), setting me up for a hard move or two later. Namely, wrecking the shack in an ash-storm or having Dremmer come back looking to squat there (or both). Assuming no interference from the PCs, of course. If they know Apocalypse World, they know that when I say things I'm giving them the chance to react. "Oh, it's all leaky and shit? That sucks. I need to get some materials to patch it up better and secure it real good." "Cool. So you go talk to Roarke?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265998/#Comment_265998" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T15:27:00+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  3:27PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2010 3:28PM by Steerpike.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, I know I can make moves as needed whenever I need something to say or when they look at me to say something, but when the player misses the roll that is just a golden opportunity for fuckery and a harder move. Have I mentioned that I love the tone the text has yet? Cause I do. To be a little clearer, there is a point when the questions you are asking to get a feel for the day to day AW life of the players give way to that first move, that's what I am talking about. <br/><br/>Now that said, I hadn't thought about it as <i>every</i> thing I say is a move. That is definite food for thought. The questions I am asking to set stuff up, those should essentially be moves then? If so I think that right there was the problem. When I was running this, I was wondering where any of this was going, and how does this make an unequal situation for me to base fronts on. And since I am not getting there then what should I be doing to get to there. Now if every question I ask is really a move or just an excuse to make one... well then.

Of course, Colin gave her a name and when I casually mentioned that they had just killed my best scavenger, Colin was all over it with the questions. Pretty soon, Mimi was a living breathing character that we cared about and when she died of her wounds Joshue declared there would be no movies until Dice made things right with Mimi. This led to a cool biker funeral scene later with Dice sneaking the body out for a burial and me having Josh use his bonefeel to show up at the funeral with a bike for her funeral pyre.<br/><br/>We're still groping around a bit with the mechanics and the realization that, in this game, if you do not Do Something, you will have something done unto you. The game feels unsettled with nothing safe, which I believe is intentional in the design, but is quite unfamiliar. I'm interested in banging on this some more and seeing how it ticks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266458/#Comment_266458" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-10T00:07:58+00:00" title="April 10, 2010 12:07AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John is the high priest of Apocalypse World.

I really was looking at the NPCs through crosshairs and not targeting your character specifically. It's just the nature of Apocalypse World that there's no safety to be had (at least not at first).

But the game never says that there ARE, so why would we think that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all in there. John isn't saying anything that's not in the book. It just blows my mind because I've read WAY too many "indie games" and going back to a game where you do "fiction" stuff until there's a rule for it and then you roll for that rule and then you move on is crazy. <br/>\n<br/>\nApocWorld is just a list of things to do during 15% of a post-apoc game. 85% of the time, do whatever you feel is awesome and post-apocalypty. And in that 15%, do exactly what the book says. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a weird game and I think our "indie baggage" is complicating things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267564/#Comment_267564" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T21:08:36+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  9:08PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, Colin's problem was exactly the opposite in our game.

The big problem I had was in missing/not understanding a crucial step and procedure for running the 1st session (and well the rest of the game!) As the MC the games procedures looked kinda like this from my read, though I did not realize the hole in my understanding till we got started:<br/><br/>Step 1 - follow the characters around and take it easy, ask questions. <br/>Step 2 - ???<br/>Step 3 - Profit! You have an unbalanced situation to build your fronts from.<br/><br/>I was having trouble forming the right questions and getting things started, and was wondering what questions I should be asking to get to the cool stuff and figure out that 2nd step. That second step was: Use the answers to make moves, and if I can't make a move then to just keep asking till I can or the players make a move. Everything locked together nicely after that little adjustment. And we had some amazing fiction that we played out and I have enough fodder to make 2-3 fronts for the next session. <br/><br/>The thing is that you use the rules 100% of the time in AW, and remember rules are not just when to roll the dice and such. In AW the MC is always using the rules and even better those rules are pretty much what every Indie or Trad GMs do all the time in games, only they have been focused and codified into the Agenda, Always Say and the Principles. This I all got, I just didn't get that the moves are how you actually accomplish those things, I had thought that the moves were the thing you did when you had an opportunity or when they were needed.  <br/><br/>It sounds like you did not have the same problems getting AW off and running in the first session, I would really like to hear about some of the stuff that you did at the table and how those things contributed to the creation of your fronts and to play.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267580/#Comment_267580" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T08:20:54+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  8:20AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>and even better those rules are pretty much what every Indie or Trad GMs do all the time in games, only they have been focused and codified into the Agenda,</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I am such a fan of mr.

Why does the Apocalypse World thing work? It's not just "how everyone GMs anyway". I mean, almost, but not quite. There are several things working together all at once to produce satisfying, interesting, conflict-ridden fiction without an overt focus on specific Conflict like some other games have:<br><br>1. Apocalypse World itself. By definition, we start in an unstable situation with the potential for violence and desperation (a large part of the "Agenda", thinks like "make Apocalypse World real" are about establishing this at the table).<br/>2. The advice for the GM to basically apply pressure and make bad stuff happen (the "moves").<br/>3. The various rules for rolling and moves and when they interact so as to produce strong consequences pretty much every time (whether positive to the PCs or negative).<br/><br/>These three things work together; take any one out and they'll collapse.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> enables <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, making it possible, potential, and available all the time. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> helps to preserve that, taking actions and turning the outcomes into more <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. Like how you get those supplies you wanted, but, chances are you lost some other important thing or made new enemies doing it.<br/><br/>So, if you take Apocalypse World rules but play in "happy present-day land", and you've got no Fronts ready, it's not going to work, right? Because there's little support for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. Or, if you have <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but the GM is waiting for the second session to get to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, you also could fall flat. That's why the GM's got to be using the moves even in the first session.
