We've never had everyone at the game table at the same time, but we've definitely had seven.  There are issues with quiet players fading into the background when you have this many people looking for scene-time, but most of my crew are pretty good about not hogging the limelight.  It helps when you can count on the players to notice something like this, and they're like "We haven't seen Boo in a while...  I go over to her clinic and see what's happening there."<br/>\n<br/>\nWith so many PCs crammed into a medium sized hold, it gets to the point where any ambitious move by one character is simply <i>going to</i> step on another PC's toes.

Any more and there would be too many directions for individual characters to go and I've got a pretty good pressure cooker going with a small holding and an incredibly active Hocus cult subverting the locals like there's no tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rooster10" title="Rooster10"><img alt="Rooster10" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rooster10">Rooster10</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321022/#Comment_321022" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T21:21:14+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  9:21PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2011 9:21PM by Rooster10.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently I can't count, because I have no idea why I said I would have seven players. There were only six, but that was still a few more than is suggested. I ran the game earlier today, and things went pretty well! We mainly just created the characters and established the relationships between them, and created the world. That took up most of the time, but I gave them some chances to use some of their moves with the time they had left so everyone could get a grasp on how it worked. Everyone seemed to latch on to the story and the game, and everyone is eager for the next session.<br/><br/>One of the players, who is totally new to tabletop RPGs was particularly awesome. I didn't expect her to pipe up much, but she added in a bunch of great stuff about the back story on the fly. I was impressed, and I feel like having that many people added to the game a little, but I can definitely see how it could be beneficial to have a smaller group. I didn't give each character as much face time as I would have liked, but everyone seemed okay with how things went.<br/><br/>I also got some decent threats out of them, so I have plenty to work with for the next session.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was great having the number of players we did, and everyone else had a blast as well. It seems like the only problem we're going to have is getting all the schedule's to jive.<br/><br/>I would like to thank everyone for their input!

Here's the gist of our first session:<br/><br/>The characters:<br/>Violetta the Battlebabe ((ex?)cult member, sleeping with Sergei)<br/>Dust the Hocus<br/>Pity the Brainer (cult member, large and not too bright)<br/>Big Fucker the Faceless (cult member)<br/>Spc. Sergei the Quarantine (loves guns, not sure how to feel about the cult)<br/>James the Driver (kind of a loner, drives the cult around, calls them weird)<br/><br/>The new player (Violetta) was great. For the first part of the game she was fairly quiet, but once she got a grasp of things, she took off. She was the first to find the Quarantine, and she ended up as his mistress and using him to get out of the cult. "Well, why do you want out of the cult so bad?" "Because I was born into it and raised this way, and the cult leader killed my parents. Now I finally have a chance to escape."<br/><br/>Pity was/is stalking Violetta, so he manipulated the Quarantine into letting him stay in his facility as well. Pity slipped up and Violetta found out she was being stalked, so she decided she wanted him dead. When I tried to steer her away from murdering the other characters in the first session, she said that she wanted to try to manipulate him into marrying the Dust, as she was about to have to enter into an arranged/forced marriage with him, but Pity could take her place. Pity's player hasn't decided whether Pity is male/female yet (chose ambiguous and concealed as his look), so he jumped at the idea as a chance to figure out his character, and the Hocus went for it as well.<br/><br/>Then there's the big dumb oaf (the character, not the player), Big Fucker, who acts as the muscles for the cult and is smitten with Pity, so he's feeling abandoned by Pity and betrayed by Dust.<br/><br/>This is going to be fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
