I chatted with Steve via email and he recommended that I post some of these on here. Please note that I have only used these for 5 person games and the warranty is voided for 3 player games.  <br/><br/>1) During the set-up, the dice selection is more focused.  The black dice can only be used to choose broad Relationship/Need/Object/Location Categories. The white dice can only be used to pick details.  The last black die and the last white die are each wild.  This tends to lead to more of a restricted set of choices, but it speeds up the initial part of the game and focuses play nicely.  The key bonus is that it tends to make for lessen analysis paralysis from the participants.<br/><br/>2)  In core Fiasco, needs/objects/locations are implicitly attached to relationships.  Normally you have 4 dice allocated to each cue-card and each participant is only connected to 2 other participants.   By contrast, my hack means that each Category/Detail goes on it's own card.  Each player shares Relationships with two people and Need/Object/Locations with the other two people.    <br/><br/>3) In a 5 players game, you have relationships with the players on the immediate left and right. You have Needs/Objects/Locations with the players 1-step away left and 1 step away right. This leads automatically with a connection to every other player. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Example of game play with the Touring Rock band </b> </span> <br/><br/>The example characters are sitting in this order, going clockwise.<br/><br/><b><br/>Alice<br/>Bruce<br/>Cara<br/>David<br/>Eva <br/></b><br/><br/>Alice pulls out a black die with a value of 2, declaring that Bruce and Cara share a <b><i>"Good Friends"</i> </b>category of Relationship.  <br/>Bruce pulls out a black die with a value of 3, declares David and Eva share <b><i>"The Grind" </i></b>Relationship. <br/>Cara pulls out a black die with a value of 5 that Eva and Alice share the <b><i>"Trouble"</i></b> Relationship.<br/>David pulls out a black die with a value of 6 that Alice and Bruce share the "<b><i>Bad Friends</i></b>" Relationship.<br/>Eva pulls out a black die with a value of 1 that Cara and David share the "<b><i>Friends</i></b>" Relationship.<br/><br/>Repeat in the same fashion with half of the white dice, allocating details for the other people's relationships.  The two people who are assigned the relationship pick how to interpret those details.  For instance, if a Eva declares that David/Eva share a "Boss/Roadie" detail on their relationship, David and Eva decide which role they want.<br/> <br/>Now you work on the Needs/Locations/Objects, once again allocating the categories with black dice and details with the white. <br/>A declares that B - D share a need of <i><b>To Get Out.</b></i><br/>B declares that A - C share a need of <i><b>To Get Wasted</b></i><br/>C declares that C - E share an location of <i><b>The Tour Bus</b></i><br/>D declares that E - B share an object of of <i><b>Dude, No Way</b></i><br/>E declares that D - A share an object of <i><b>Rollin'</b></i><br/><br/>Repeat in the same fashion with remaining white dice, allocating details for the other people's Needs, Locations or Objects. <br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>How this impacts play</b></span><br/>Every character is connected to every other character, which means the game is more tight-knit.  Every participant knows and is engaged with the other characters.  I have enjoyed how the gameplay worked out and I would like to hear your thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341323/#Comment_341323" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T22:37:55+00:00" title="September  1, 2011 10:37PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude.

The first we actually playtested and rejected - your analysis paralysis is my "absorb the setting and color as you pore over 144 items". But clearly it works both ways.<br/><br/>The second was never really an option for me - I like the way a 4 or 5 player game starts with people outside your sphere of influence. I think this is simultaneously more accessible (just look to your right and left and you know what to do at all times) and allows for discovery in play rather than in advance. It makes the characters slightly more one-dimensional, too, which, weirdly, I think is a feature for this very specific application. But again, there's nothing wrong with your hack.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing them! I hope people try them out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341664/#Comment_341664" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T17:39:26+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  5:39PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 5:39PM by Jason_Pitre.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *chuckles*  I suspected that option 1 would have come up during playtesting.  I understand completely that you would broaden the setting and colour by pouring over the different options.  Fundamentally, I suspect you are secretly convincing people to consider using some of the other items and work them into the game.<br/> <br/>Now I need to play a few 5-player games without either of the hacks. I am quite curious how that changes the mood of play.<br/><br/>Thanks for the comments and explanation Jason!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
