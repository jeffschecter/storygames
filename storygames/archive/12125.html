A very moving and inspiring book I strongly recommend. And this reading will have a direct impact on my project.<br/><br/><strong>A little history</strong><br/>I've been working on my project for eight years now, always having a gut feeling toward the reason it was designed that way. And then, by about four years in process I discovered the Forge and various communities of indie publishers. When presenting my product, people asked me "what I am supposed to do with this?", to which I answered "I don't know". Most of the participants told me I could not answer that way. So, I worked on a better answer, exchange with people who really helped me. I now know how to describe, in great lengths, the main difference between what I'm doing and what's common on the market. I can explain those differences, the main advantages, the type of players of might be more inclined to buy it. <br/><br/>This is very rational, and don't get me wrong, very useful. It took me a long time to know this and a lot of help. And that's the kind of things one needs to have in a business plan, so the process needs to be there. But, that's kind of odd : it has only been one year that I really know WHAT I am doing. I have putted so much efforts in finding it out, I thought I would really use it.<br/><br/><strong>Promotion</strong><br/>I intend to release a first pdf version of Avalanche this summer. We're currently working on the promotion/marketing plan. We have a good idea of the part of the market we want to target. We also know, how to describe the differences between our products and our competition. This is a little bit lengthy, but it is quite understandable. Armed with those tools, we are ready to launch a product with a strong promotion strategy.<br/><br/><strong>Sell WHY, not WHAT</strong><br/>Simon Sinek explains that people don't buy WHAT you're selling but WHY you are selling it. It is the key for innovators to build a strong fan base. He explains it in long length in his book. WHY is based on gut feeling, WHAT is rational.<br/>We went into a lot efforts to describe our WHAT, and we were going to use it as much as we could. I mean, there are strong rational reasons to buy Avalanche instead of the typical modules. But, this doesn't really matter I think. And, to explain it takes time.<br/>But, promoting Avalanche through the WHY "prism" makes so much sense. And it is so much easier. And, I always knew WHY I was doing this. So, we're going to change completely our promotion strategy.<br/>I still need to think a little bit about it, especially about how to formulate it, but our WHY would look like :<br/>"This is not a book where you are the hero, but a book where you are the author." "We need you to finish the book." "We value more the creative process than the final product."<br/>This is our vision and this is what we should put in the back of the product; the first thing a customer should come across. They may like it or not, it doesn't matter. It is very simple and easy to get : it isn't rational.<br/>And one of the most beautiful thing I find about this is that it all gets easier suddenly. If you come across a product stating "we need you to finish the book", it seems clear to me that I can't tell you what you'll do with it; otherwise, I would have finished the book.<br/>For sure, someone who agrees with this vision, will come across, in the book, on our lengthy explanation on HOW we do the stuff we're doing. But this part should only reinforces our WHY. Using this filter, the WHY filter, our main differences is much more easier to "get".<br/><br/><strong>Questions</strong><br/>Do you find Simon as aspiring as I do ? I do have the sense that the indie community did go in length explaining, with a lot of theory, the differences between story games and the others, but what about the WHY ? Finally, may I challenge you to tell me your WHY ?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271520/#Comment_271520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T05:36:08+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  5:36AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say, thinking about "Why are you selling product X?" as a question that is explicit rather than implicit, it seems so weird.

Be bold, traveler!</blockquote>\nJust my guts feeling about this, and I'm no expert on the WHY matter. How about something like this instead :<br/><i>We believe</i> that a legendary adventure, your adventure, should always be about life and death. Life and death should always be at stake.<br/><br/>That said, for example, we have a strong existentialist approach (the philosophy, that is), in Avalanche. Life is about giving sense, in time. It is about choices.<br/>We could also go with : This is your adventure. But, hey, this is rpg, so I don't think it is much information about our vision.<br/>We would go instead with something like this (a little bit too long to my taste) :<br/><i>We believe</i> that playing an adventure is about finding <i>your</i> purpose ; not much about what you choose, but what you choose not. But, to make your own choices, to find your own place in the world, you need to have choices <i>in the first place</i>.<br/><br/>Given that upfront, someone would not be surprised to find that Avalanche is multi plots, not about the PCS, calendar based as all the stories happen at the same time, that he won't be able to use all the products in a single campaign (20% at the most).<br/>But this is all WHAT, this is all rational and arguments to present you the design. It takes time, it needs to be convincing. But knowing WHY beforehand helps understands it all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>A very important point.

But this is for me, and the term is important, a new <i>paradigm</i>.<br/>Reading Simon Sinek, he explains at the end that he came to a point where he asks himself if he should "reveal" this paradigm or try to make money out of it (and protect the concept). He chose to talk openly about it.<br/>Now, I must admit I had been really impressed by his work and his message. We (me and my partners) really reinvent completely our promotion strategy. And I believe this is the way to do it.<br/><br/>I believe the indie community of rpg is very innovative (in Sinek's speech, he talks about the law of innovation and distribution) and should benefit from this speech.<br/><br/>Now, about the evangelical part : paradigms are new way to see the world, to explain it. I did study philosophy and came across some paradigms that really reached me : existentialist, the ironic liberal of Rorty. Each time it changed the way I saw the world. I always had a feeling of coming full circle with those : everything was already there, it was the way that I saw that changed. And, of course, when you find a new paradigm (and please note that Sinek's discourse really changed the way I see things at my job and even as a consumer), you tend to be enthusiast about it.

Sometimes you are just mucking around with some stuff, and it seems like something might be in there somewhere, but you don't have a clear direction yet. Yeah, I've done that myself.<br/><br/>So, statement v2.0:<br/>A vital step, at some point, is to know the WHY of the thing being made, and to then make sure the design serves that WHY. To do otherwise is just shooting blind and hoping you get lucky.<br/><br/>Is that more in accord with your experience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271588/#Comment_271588" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T18:35:28+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  6:35PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is that not everything I create has an equivalently great WHY, and those that don't have a great one fall by the wayside.
