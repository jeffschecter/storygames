The first game was imperfect, since I was still reading through the rules. After some time to reread and asking some questions of the author, I felt more prepared for the second game. I was also inspired to give the group a taste of the long-term mechanics that happen when you run through multiple jobs. My plan: sprint through the three phases of a previous job - Analysis, Operation, Blowback - to give them a basic feel for how that structure works, and to set up some forward momentum for the main job.<br/><br/>It turns out that the original botched job - the one that stranded the spies in the city - was a good fit for this. I began with a few Analysis rolls: "this is how you do it Without Incident, now you're Going For Broke, and notice that you're using up your Nerve". I then fast-forwarded to some choice Operation rolls: "See how we're using the prep dice? [boom] See how we're improvising a new plan now, without said dice?"<br/><br/>I then suggested some extra stress that the group would have taken on in the course of a job, taking us right into Blowback where the group's previous stresses turn into changed relationships. In about 15 minutes time, this was a good bit of improvisational warmup and set up some basic relationships to play upon in the job proper.<br/><br/>And so, we entered the Analysis phase for a new job: a Justice Seeker taking on a corrupt cop, and of course this wasn't the whole story. I immediately ensnared a Civilian with a sympathetic approach from the Client, and made sure to keep up the personal pressure on the character.<br/><br/>The title of the post comes from a great scene from the Analsyis phase. A Provocateur specialist set up a meeting with a crooked cop, posing as a very Southern, very aristocratic mobster. "And sir, with my business interests being what they are, I thought it would be to my advantage to speak with a member of the constablery."<br/><br/>We laughed, but this was also a great setup for the character. Later, under interrogation, this character "broke down" and revealed his "real accent" (which we knew was just another faked accent). Moments later, once he was rescued and the tables were turned, he was now speaking in his own, real accent, spoken with the urgency of a professional spy with no further time to waste on pleasantries.<br/><br/>Other events from our game: a driven reporter actually participates in bugging a cop's office, and likes getting in over her head; a young child listens in on a planted bug as her brother reveals his crimes; the operatives rescue each other a few times over; a mafia mook is more or less kicked through a Starbucks window in order to "send a message"; a corrupt cop turns the gun on himself, with the reporters live cameras rolling nearby; and justice is further deferred in the city of New Orleans. A local District Attorney's political ambitions are nearly crushed, but she still has power - and now, a grudge against the Professionals. (And certainly: the vulnerable Civilian reporter.)<br/><br/>I also used the "Red Herring" move on the Push Pyramid to get the group needlessly entangled with the (actual) mob. (See also: the broken Starbucks window.) This is another neat thing from speeding through a cycle of Analysis/Operation/Blowback: I got a chance to play with Push Pyramid moves (specific ways the Agency can earn the chance to mess with the players).<br/><br/>....So that was Blowback. If you were in either of the games, I'd love to hear anything else you remember!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/idle%20daedal" title="idle daedal"><img alt="idle daedal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/idle%20daedal">idle daedal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287177/#Comment_287177" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:19:45+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:19AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great write-up, Dev!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm the guy that played Jim Caffrey/The Face/"Louis Beauregard IV," who met with a "a member of the constablery."  I don't have too much to add, except this was a really great introduction to Blowback!  I'm hoping to get a chance to play again, because it was a hell of a lot of fun, it mimicked caper stories (like Burn Notice, Leverage, or Oceans 11) really well.  There were a couple parts of the system I didn't get to engage with too much, and I'd love to hear them hum in multi-session play.  Specifically, I ended our session with zero stress in any of my relationships, probably because Jim was too willing to help out.  His dossier indicated he wanted two things:  to bed whom he fancies and to help the distressed.  I decided he had a thing for our venerable mastermind (salt &amp; pepper hair + a background in the Navy Seals = hot, apparently), but we didn't have enough time to leverage that element because of the complexity of the story - and that was totally ok.  There were lots of people in distress, so I had an easy time justifying that Jim would gladly help out, but somehow it was always done under the pretense of The Job, so I never had to mark any stress.  Maybe I was missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also really interested in the use of the first two phases as a dicepool building &amp; allocation mechanic.  I thought it was solidly done and inspirational for a game I'm fiddling about with right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny case, our game kicked all kinds of ass, and I'm only sad that we didn't have time to see how the DA will strike back!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287403/#Comment_287403" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T21:39:28+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:39PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am also curious about how to continually press for stress in long-term play. The GM's job is set up some stressing situations (probably during Analysis), but otherwise to mainly remind players when they'd be stressing each others' relationships.<br/><br/>If I had a chance to play a followup (possibly involving the DA, possibly not), I'd be all over it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kiznit" title="kiznit"><img alt="kiznit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kiznit">kiznit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287984/#Comment_287984" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T20:39:03+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  8:39PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2010 8:39PM by kiznit.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi guys!<br/><br/>I was in the second game as well, playing "Archer Grey", the retired man on the street who knew a little bit of everyone.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure whether the mob connection was something you introduced or something I made up - I was just throwing out names like "Jimmy Two-Legs" and "Frankie the Fixer" just to throw out some plot hooks and make my character seem like he really did know folks in both high and low places. Regardless, you ran with it - or we all did - and it added another layer to well, the layer cake that Blowback can be.<br/><br/>"Pressure" was the name of the game, and it's really a fun system. Thanks again for running it! I especially enjoyed how as the game progressed we ended up running out of people to rescue the people who were rescuing people.<br/><br/>Also Jim Caffrey was hilarious, though I had no idea he had a "thing" for Archer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
