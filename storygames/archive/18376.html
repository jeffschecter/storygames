I'm finding the Savvyhead in particular difficult to get involved in threats/fronts... they just seem to want to spend time in their workspace. How do I make that interesting? (to a lessor extent advice on how to make an Angel's infirmary sing).

Maybe ask them why these things are happening, let them tell you - that way, you'll know what sort of problem interests them. After all, it's not all about you being entertainer - they want something out of this, too, otherwise they wouldn't be in their workspaces.<br/><br/>I'd also send them directly out of their workspaces, and Angels totally have a reason to do that (you know, blood and guts don't travel well). Savvyheads, you're actually given a tool for that. When they want to make something, tell them they need some piece of crap or other that is Only To Be Found in X location over yonder. If it doesn't make a lot of sense, come up with some circuitous bumpf for why, or ask them why they need it. There's also that bit that means you can say they need to add something to their workspace, and that might just be something that can't be synthesized inside the workspace itself, on account of absurd size or improbable fixtures or something.<br/><br/>Oh, and let them rebuild if that first part goes awry. Because it will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414167/#Comment_414167" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T08:17:47+00:00" title="May 16, 2013  8:17AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It probably sounds simplistic, but I'd suggest giving the workspace characters something to work on from time to time, and some (non-negotiable) reasons to leave the workspaces from time to time.<br/><br/>Things that have drawn my group's Savvyhead out of the workspace and into actively moving the plot:<br/><br/>Seeing strange, gas-mask-clad travelers peddling unusual tech in the holding.<br/>A supply run in the dangerous part of the city. <br/>Being called into a tense meeting with the Hardholder (NPC).<br/>A dead body with mysterious wounds at the front gate of the holding.<br/><br/>She tends to retreat back to her workspace during combat. Of course, her workspace is a van, so she never has to be TOO far from it. We have also drawn the plot into the Savvyhead's workspace, where people followed her (e.g., getting her hands on an NPC Brainer's Violation Glove, while someone distracted the Brainer). <br/><br/>Granted, it sounds like I am luckier than you in that my group's Savvyhead WANTS to be involved in the plot, and will actively suggest things to shape the world. (It was her suggestion that made the downtown area of the city a dangerous hub in the psychic maelstrom, her idea to go downtown for a supply run I didn't impose on her, and her question on rolling weird \u2013\xa0"Did we awaken something?" \u2013\xa0that basically created the biggest, scariest front in the game.)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414168/#Comment_414168" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T08:22:10+00:00" title="May 16, 2013  8:22AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That list of 8 or so possible complications in the workshop rules (in the Savvyhead playbook) is GOLD for this: all of them push the Savvyhead to get resources and support from elsewhere to be able to complete (or even start!) a project. Adding caveats if they skip part of the prerequisites also gives them interesting choices.<br/><br/>"You've got it all sketched out, but you'll need either two other people to hold the jaguar down while you bolt on the tentacles, or a serious sedative to knock it out while you work."<br/><br/>"The rust plague hasn't cropped up in town, but it's just a matter of time. You can build the necro-etheric transmitter, sure, but until you figure out a cure, you'll need to watch out for contamination: nobody will be able to use this without wrecking it but you."<br/><br/>"Sounds great! Only catch is, you don't have any Langly nodes, haven't seen one in ages. Trolololol's cult ransacked a Langly warehouse last month though, so they might have one. If you could talk Mad Dog into letting you tear down a few of her choppers you could probably make something that'd work for a few days at least.

But, also:<br/><br/>Why work so hard to bring "the game" to the player? Ask, instead, what the player is into. Does their character have plans? Who bothers them? What are they afraid of? Who are they afraid <i>for</i>? What do they wish they could change in their life?<br/><br/>When was the last time something they made or worked on turned out horribly, horribly wrong? Why is it suddenly becoming a problem again now?<br/><br/>And then make the game about that.<br/><br/>I find that, in AW, sometimes you've got ideas and you throw them out in front of you. Other times, ask the players and use their ideas. When you're frustrated or things aren't working... it's best to turn it over to the players, and ask them where they want to take things next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
