It's pure task resolution, and often with very little (or nothing at all!) at stake.<br/><br/>For instance, the PCs decide to pose as servants in the King's fort, hoping to pick up on some news or gossip while they're there. They headmaster asks them to mop the floors or prepare bedrooms for guests, or some similar menial task. The GM has everyone roll, to see how well they perform the job.<br/><br/>Or maybe the PCs are coming in to land at headquarters. The GM tells the pilot, "Ok, roll to see if your landing is smooth or bumpy."<br/><br/>Two PCs say they spend the afternoon sparring with each other for practice. "Let's roll to see who fights better!"<br/><br/>The party has made camp, and is trying to get some rest in preparation for tomorrow's adventure. One PC is preparing dinner for the others. The GM says, "Ok, roll your Cooking skill!"<br/><br/>The outcome of the dice roll is then used to inject some Colour into the narration. ("That evening, the rabbit stew is stringy and tasteless, and you all go to bed feeling a little unsatisfied, with grumbling stomachs." "Kenny prepares the bedroom nicely, with all sheets tucked in, but the room prepared for the Duke is a little shoddy, and you miss some dust under the cupboard, which the Duke's handmaid is sure to notice.")<br/><br/>Some other examples:<br/><br/>* In the procedural/investigation genre, sometimes the GM has a string of clues the PCs must follow. In a scene where a clue surely MUST be found for the game to progress, the GM might have everyone roll, and then give the clue to the highest roller. This gives the characters a bit of a pecking order, or more characterization: "Jane is the smart one; she's always the first one to spot the clue!"<br/><br/>* Sometimes, these rolls can become very important in retrospect. The heroes tie up the villain; the GM asks them to make a "Rope Use" roll to see how well they tie him up. They roll pretty poorly; later, when the villain turns out to have escaped, the roll is a natural justification. Of course he escaped! Stupid Jim didn't tie his bonds securely enough!<br/><br/>How do you feel about this kind of roll?<br/><br/>From a modern design perspective, there is a trend in game design to say that this kind of thing is not an efficient or useful game procedure: dice rolls and mechanized procedures should be for important, focal elements of play. (Typically conflict resolution.)<br/><br/>When I'm playing Monsterhearts or Dogs in the Vineyard, there's no rolling of this type.<br/><br/>Looking back with the wisdom of hindsight, is there something to be explored here, or is it a good thing we've left this behind?<br/><br/>Although, as a designer, I winced a number of times while writing this post ("Oh, the pain! Why would you roll for that?"), I realized that, as a player, I don't particularly mind this. It's fun to have a little detail to throw in once in a while. Maybe the character who's in charge of the cooking misses three rolls in a row, and now we all laugh because apparently the group's chef is a terrible cook - it becomes a source of jokes and banter for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>What's your take?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422769/#Comment_422769" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T10:08:23+00:00" title="October 12, 2013 10:08AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing I would say (to have a conversation with myself for a moment) is that this kind of procedure, unlike conflict resolution, is very dependent on precise odds and curves. <br/><br/>For instance, it sucks to roll for landing your plane if the system you're using gives you a "critical failure" 5% of the time. Likewise, it's weird to be rolling to bake a pie if you can often achieve a result of "Legendary success! Best in the country".<br/><br/>So, if you're going to roll for this kind of thing, you need a finely-calibrated random process, which is not an easy thing. Some tasks, after all, are more random than others, and it's hard to field everything on the same scale. I remember, as a trad gamer, constantly looking for ways to tweak probabilities so that task resolution outcomes would "feel right" in different situations. In several systems, I used different dice (more variable -&gt; less variable) for stressful situations like combat and routine situations. On this level, things never quite felt right: real life (and fiction) doesn't work on a consistent bell curve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422770/#Comment_422770" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T10:23:26+00:00" title="October 12, 2013 10:23AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Task resolution is an useful tool for providing color. We roll, and then riff off the result to create some choreography for whatever it is that's happening. <i>Solar System</i>, for example, leaves the door open for doing this: you just want to see how this thing goes, let's roll for it and see. (Of course the game also leaves the door open for the player to make the choice post-roll to create a resource off the roll, or for the SG to riff additional outcomes off the degree of success, so no roll in the game is entirely devoid of substantial consequence unless everybody chooses this to be the case.)<br/><br/>Also, certain games use this task resolution more subtly, to establish arbitrary detail that might become pertinent later. For example, considering your PCs masquerading as servants: I can totally imagine how I might ask for something like that in D&amp;D, in the spirit of its "conflict resolution through short loop task resolution", as I've termed it. I wouldn't know yet while asking for that roll whether it'll be important, but just moments later I'm running a scene where the majordomo berates the guy who rolled a critical fumble, and then that might blow their cover. The great thing is, this outcome will have come about seemingly arbitrarily and randomly, there would be no single player at the table who'd have maneuvered for it to occur. The DM wouldn't have the moral responsibility for it, either - you rolled a 1, that's why it happened! All in all, quite useful, and quite impossible to achieve without having a practice of asking for those task rolls whether they matter or not. This type of play simply requires a constant stream of fictional positioning to be established; it'll be too late if you start asking about the quality of the housework when the majordomo random encounter is already in place, as at that point you're forced to establish the detail retroactively, and it's much more difficult for everybody to separate player and character knowledge ("My character totally would've dusted on the highest shelves, too!").<br/><br/>I don't feel that using task resolution rolls as a tool is a problem, and I never have - I always (as in, I think I wrote my first opinion piece on the matter in -04 or so) felt that the popular task vs. conflict dichotomy in the discussions during the last decade was idiotic, and mostly caused by an incapability to see beyond a false comparison. (Comparing task vs. conflict is a category error - not the topic here, though, so I won't go into more detail.)<br/><br/>Where the problem comes in, and where task resolution gets its bad reputation, is specifically and exactly in obfuscatory conflict resolution practices: the GM lets you roll the dice for a task resolution, and then resolves the conflict utilizing his implicit narrative powers, and that might break your own implicit expectations that this roll you did should matter somehow. Once this practice (the GM fiats conflicts while obfuscating with task resolution) is firmly embedded, it opens the door to other GM hygiene issues like playing favorites, railroading, and that whole panoply, simply because now the GM has a massive amount of extra power that nobody at the table quite perceives or understands, and no oversight whatsoever to what he's doing with it, except perhaps some lukewarm rulebook advice about how he's supposed to make sure everybody has fun in the game.<br/><br/>As you can see, the above explains why task resolution is not universally reviled: if you play with a GM who does not do the power-grab over conflict resolution, or does not abuse the unwritten powers that gains him, then you won't necessarily see any problems with traditional task resolution. Good for you. Even better for everybody, now that we understand the issue, we have no difficulty creating games that utilize mechanized task resolution (I'm specific here because, as I like to say, all games have task resolution - it's just non-mechanical in some), should it be an useful concern. We have the language and the theoretical understanding, and task resolution is slowly gaining a more varied and interesting place in design, as opposed to always being this cat's paw for the GM's pretentions of puppet mastery.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422771/#Comment_422771" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T10:29:11+00:00" title="October 12, 2013 10:29AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, in my D&amp;D you totally have a 5% failure rate in landing a plane. This is because of what I call "enchanted probability": because we want to play exciting stuff, everything the player characters do goes through a wringer that exaggerates unlikely events somewhat. This is why all sorts of million-to-one chances actually have a 1-in-20 to happen, should a player suggest the possibility. Good examples of this are random encounters: despite every effort of every sandbox GM ever, it is absolutely impossible to provide realistic odds of interesting encounters while simultaneously running an interesting game; thus we instead constructively pretend that 1-in-6 is about right for whether my characters stumble upon that goblin hunting party during their 6-hour trek between two towns.<br/><br/>That is to say, it's too simple to claim that task resolution inherently requires some specific approach to resolving tasks. It's exactly no more and no less than what it sounds like: how and for what purpose do you resolve individual tasks in your game? In one game you might want to get totally realistic odds for landing a plane successfully, while in another the case is that when the game has already progressed to the point where a plane is being landed, the only sensible thing to do is to resolve the task by a 50/50 coin flip. Just like you can resolve conflicts in different ways and for different reasons, you can do the same for tasks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422772/#Comment_422772" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T10:58:26+00:00" title="October 12, 2013 10:58AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2013 10:59AM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The outcome of the dice roll is then used to inject some Colour into the narration.

In the examples given so far (like landing the plane or faking identity), it has all been about "are the PCs successful and to what degree?" whereas in AW, the rolls determine success AND allow the players and GM to instantly build upon the narrative of the situation. I suppose that can be done in any system just by the GM asking "OK, you succeeded, does anything else happen?" but I've never had that experience. I suspect because doing so can drag things out more than needed/wanted. The moves are pretty brilliant at bringing more to the story that is instantly relevant. <br/><br/>I like task resolution - as already pointed out, it can have a big impact on the story in unexpected ways - as long as GMs don't let it derail the game.

But, yeah, you have to be consistent about this sort of thing for it to work.<br/><br/>Moreover, I think you see a lot of problems with this sort of rolling in games where it's *explicitly* called out that you don't roll for trivial shit. BW, for example, will completely break down if you start rolling cooking every time you make camp.

I can't think of a time I've experienced that, Jason, or at least not the beneficial version. Pointless rolling generally happens when the game is stalling, and since the roll is pointless, it fails to kickstart the action.<br/><br/>Whereas something like, "Hey, nothing is happening, let's roll on this oracle table" seems different than what we're talking about here.<br/><br/>Bear in mind, I don't disagree at all about the motivations behind calling for rolls. But attempting to make players happy by having them roll dice for no reason is unlikely to work more than once or twice.<br/><br/>Whereas Eero's thing, about always rolling for small things in certain types of fiction-rich trad play, also seems okay, since the GM is precisely not doing it to try and either please or screw over the player.<br/><br/>But, obviously, YMMV. I personally have not observed "call for a roll, any roll" to have a beneficial effect on a game.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422792/#Comment_422792" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T11:01:24+00:00" title="October 13, 2013 11:01AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's probably not obvious unless you are the GM.

In both AW and the presumed examples, the story is changed through bad rolls. If Jane is failing in landing-the-plane roll, the game master will give a consequence. If failing in InSpectres, the game master will give a consequence. If the rolls are successful, the player will tell something about their character through their actions. "Jane is an excellent pilot". In AW/InSpectres, it's instead about how the story advances, but that's another way of telling something about the character.

(What do you with an average, middle-of-the-road, "Rope Use" roll?)<br/><br/>When it does bear fruit, however, it can be dramatically effective. (Particularly in a comedy genre - or just with a group that enjoys having a laugh or two as they play. "Ha-ha! Joe the Bugbear failed his hunting check again! He'll be watching the camp from now on!")<br/><br/>It can also be effective simply as a procedure of play: people really *do* enjoy engaging the gears-and-bolts of a new game, rolling dice, consulting oracles, drawing cards, and so forth. I've seen many a player's eyes light up when someone says, "Ok, roll those dice!" Now, I'm not 100% sure whether that effect would be felt as strongly in a really engaging, driven game. Maybe that effect is a symptom, rather, of a bored player, or someone who can't figure out how to engage with a certain game?<br/><br/>Dave, you make a great point about any downsides/strange results rolls may have in a given system becoming just THAT MUCH more noticeable when the rolls are used in this kind of routine manner. That's the main problem I have with this technique, as I mentioned earlier. I remember, back in my excusively-trad days, constantly trying to adjust the probabilities of various rolls and never quite being satisfied with the results: no matter what I settled on, it would feel right in Situation A and then horribly out-of-whack in Situation B.<br/><br/>Anyway, great discussion, thanks everyone. (Not intended as a closing remark; I hope the discussion continues.)<br/><br/>One detail which is interesting is what Matt brings up: some games are amenable to this kind of treatment, and others are completely allergic to it. Highly drama-driven games (particularly games where important relationships or issues are intended to be on the line with every roll of the dice), games with very detailed resolution procedures (e.g. Dogs in the Vineyard), and games which require resource allocation/expenditure from anyone interfacing with the resolution mechanics (e.g. the Pool, any game where you get X rolls per scene, and so forth) all are pretty hard to engage in this manner.<br/><br/>I remember noticing this when I designed a variant of TSoY which used the Pools (Reason, Instinct, and Vigor) as resource Pools a la the Pool (i.e. they could fluctuate up or down, depending on success or failure). It worked great... but it was now impossible -- or at least senseless - to engage the mechanics for "Color" purposes, as we could do in TSoY, where rolling the dice, on its own, doesn't cost anyone anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422861/#Comment_422861" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T21:04:45+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  9:04PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That whole "dice rolling is inherently fun" thing really fades with experience and insight.

I've definitely seen groups get in the habit of making lots of task rolls, and then wind up making them at times when they really aren't okay with any given result.<br/><br/>I wonder if it would be possible to ditch the stupid immediate outcomes (extreme roll produces failure at something routine) but keep the useful fallout?  Arbitrary events as fodder for subsequent play needn't all be unexpected failures or successes right?  <br/><br/>Maybe instead, routine task rolls could be made to determine synergy?  "When you do this thing you can obviously do, roll to see if happens to mesh well or poorly with the immediate circumstances."  So if you know how to light a fire, you aren't going to roll badly and somehow forget this skill, but you could provide an unfortuitous signal to a nearby hostile.  I like this general idea, but involving immediate work on the GM's part to invent "so how does that mesh well / poorly?" is probably a bad idea.  Something more akin to the simple factoids produced by traditional task rolls would probably be better.  "The branches here produce smelly smoke, which the wind carries into the forest," for example.

I think that's why there's almost no situation in which rolling for random shit is an unqualified good. You're inevitably going to get the "then why the fuck are we rolling????" phenomenon. Look at Totally Guy's story about landing the plane. It's pretty clear that crashing the plane would have "derailed the plot." So it couldn't happen. But then what were the dice used to determine?<br/><br/>BTW, your idea about meshes well / poorly is pretty similar to how resolution of simple Skill or Stat rolls is often handled in Burning Wheel. The fact that the GM has to state consequences of failure before rolls often leads to indirect results, such as accidentally signaling the enemy, when flat-out "you fail" would be stupid. It's a great GMing discipline to develop; everyone should try it. It builds great skills that can be brought back to other frameworks\u2014even if you do wind up running a game with more frequent rolling, and not *every* roll matters, it still keeps your mind open to possibilities: ramifications, indirect results, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422900/#Comment_422900" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T07:35:04+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  7:35AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another approach is the Apocalypse World approach: a "failure" is a "GM move", but it's not constrained to failure at the task, nor is it expected to produce a specific level of "badness".

It's not arbitrary. You roll during points of tension (seriously; look at the places where rolls trigger--none of them are placed in a location that doesn't involve tension; it's deliberate design), and fallout comes out of the tension.

There's no such as a right way to play the game, since even social "standards" are different from person to person. Of course, you can always communicate how you feel about it so everyone on the table can adjust their standards accordingly.<br/><br/>About rolling the dice, another option is that either players or GM can start to use it as a tool for inspiration either for color or actual plot. For example, The PCs prepare their food, a good roll could be converted into "the smell of the stew is so good it attracts wild animals, so now you're faced against (roll random encounter table, or picks up the manual suddenly inspired)..."<br/><br/>I've often found myself without ideas to complete this or that scene and rolling a dice yourself to see the chance of this or that happening helps a lot focuse yourself. Asking players to roll dice, even for no reason works nicely as a cue to grab their attention an interest. Of course, if its an obviously good or bad roll and you actually don't use it for anything is natural for players to feel it was totally useless and blame the GM, instead of feeling they missed something and blame the dice for it.<br/><br/>So the annoying player in TotallyGuy example actually wanted to go narr, didn't mind something bad happening to the character and thought that was good table etiquette to make the dice justify it instead of just saying it. But didn't notice he was doing that with the wrong game/group and came up as a spotlight stealer when everyone else on the table was expecting the GM feedback. Well, just a possibility, I wasn't there so it could have been just a dysfunctional player anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422928/#Comment_422928" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T14:59:11+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  2:59PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually think rolling to determine stuff that randomly crosses your mind (and is attributable to chance) sounds pretty fun!

So "please roll to see if you make a good expression with your landing" is totally fine. But since the default is "roll to see if you succeed at all" you have to define the stake before the roll.

I was swearing allegiance to my nemesis for the sake of my friends and family. But it wasn't a bluff--it was an honest attempt to put aside differences and suck it up. I had totally thrown the GM for a loop in doing so. But I had to justify violating my character's principles to myself, so I made resolve checks when I had to repeat the words of fealty--appropriately I failed on the last line that involved my everlasting soul. If I hadn't ... I would have gone along with it and really shaken up my character and the campaign which would have been really cool. But it was just as cool to have that little moment to reinforce who the character was, what she was about, and why she was fighting. Play moved on as it would have if I'd never pushed us off the more evident path, but it was a great dramatic moment.<br/><br/>To be fair this was my character's spotlight arc, so such self-absorbed gestures were more understandable in context. But I don't see a problem with it in systems with lots of task resolution detail. Instead of just fiddling with your pencil, you can fiddle with your dice. Instead of just fiddling with your dice, you can have your character fiddle with the world around them with little to no consequence. It might "distract" from the main proceedings, but it also gives your character a presence in the world. They just DO things sometimes, like try not to fall asleep or try to untie a tricky tangle in the rope in their backpack, or what-have-you. Consider, too, why we use dice at all; it's for bringing chance into the proceedings and for allowing us to create stories we aren't confident/charismatic/skilled enough to tell on our own. While some players think of those little in-world fidgets ... other players might not without the dice there to absorb their in-world fiddling and inspire them to make seemingly inconsequential checks. Also sometimes it's NICE to interrupt the main proceedings. One of the hardest things for people new to table gaming is all the waiting while other people do things. Even a good GM ends up leaving people out of the action for a little while here and there--I don't think it can be a good thing in some groups for players to feel comfortable having their character take just a bit of the spotlight for just a moment to do something that doesn't impact the main swing of the session but still makes them feel included instead of just present.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423181/#Comment_423181" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-19T05:06:03+00:00" title="October 19, 2013  5:06AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><br/>In another game I played the GM told us we were on a flight across the altantic.

So when you roll a 10+ it's kind of like giving the player narrative control, a 7-9 often creates a kind of joint story-telling in which the GM offers the players something or the players have to make a choice, and a 6- gives the GM the narrative. <br/><br/>That usually involves task resolution, but it can bring in other parts of the story, too.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423288/#Comment_423288" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-22T08:03:25+00:00" title="October 22, 2013  8:03AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's only one problem being solved: that when you get in the habit of rolling pass/fail all the time for every little task, you wind up doing it for things where one result (usually "fail") might be unacceptable.<br/><br/>Remembering to determine that "<i>this</i> roll is for how <i>stylish</i> the landing is, not <i>whether you can land</i>" may be easy for you, but some groups could definitely use some sort of consistent reminder.</blockquote>\nBurning Wheel, when played strictly by the rules, requires that both potential outcomes be enumerated before the roll is made. This is pretty much the opposite of the looser approach, but I've found that in play as the group builds up trust the expectation sets in and the GM tends to slack off a bit on strictly anticipating the effects. One difference is that there's more overt negotiation over narrative control than AW's rather elegant division.<br/><br/>It might be interesting to see what happens if you have an entire game of building AW-moves on the fly, defining them before each roll as they come up. World of Dungeons play approaches this sometimes, at least when I've run it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423290/#Comment_423290" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-22T08:42:23+00:00" title="October 22, 2013  8:42AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Burning Wheel "Patiently" and "Quickly" are ways of spending extra successes on description.  They seem to be rarely used rules.  <br/><br/>Graduated tests could be considered to be a full on "roll to see how well you did" in a descriptive way.  I had a player play an Orc with "Bastions of Hatred" the Orc Architecture skill.  The player suggested decorating the cave while the warchief recovered from an injury.  As there was nothing at stake but I didn't want it transformed into Blackrock Spire right away I suggested a grauated test of the skill.  With a few successes the lair now had a couple of small turrets and a trench at the front by the time the warchief was back on his feet.<br/><br/>I have seen them used to set obstacles instead, "you hide the sword with 5 successes therefore to find it someone will need 5 successes". <br/>But I usually err on the vs test, "You hide it, we'll roll to see how well when someone tries to find it and it'll be a versus test."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
