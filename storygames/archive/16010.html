A beginner-friendly game is one where you never ask them to "make a character", but rather merely guide them through a set of discrete, concrete steps that result in a character having been realized to whatever extent is necessary for the game at hand. Thus, a beginner-friendly game will either not require much realization from characters, or whatever amount of requires, it reliably accomplishes via its character creation procedure.<br/><br/>Conversely, the worst game from this viewpoint is the one that relies on an intuitive, higly developed sense of what "creating a character" entails. These games are almost always immersive traditional designs where you spend a lot of time e.g. buying powers for your character, but this process is ancillary to what you should really be doing: the game fails if you don't have a complete and entertaining personality to play when the time for that comes. If you're running one of these, I recommend explaining to the player that he should first develop an imaginary image of his character, and then go through the many layers of "buy things from lists" with a firm image of his character concept in mind: pick whatever things at first glance match your character vision, move through quickly and hold onto a strong image of what your character is like. Tell about it to the other players, too, so they know to play to it to whatever degree they're able and the game allows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364910/#Comment_364910" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T14:34:34+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  2:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pick two interesting characters from that genre and do a mashup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364913/#Comment_364913" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T14:41:25+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  2:41PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A.

I asked if anyone needed help, and showed a couple of people how to follow the steps on the sheet.<br/><br/>When we'd finished, and just before we started doing Hx, I remembered it'd be a good idea to introduce ourselves as people too.

More generally, recombining genre archetypes is a nice easy approach, that I think works without loss of character development potential.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>A. Give them a partially generated character with 3-4 decisions remaining. Have one of these decisions be their name, and at least one decision be mechanical.</blockquote>\nThis one's cool too. I reckon it's structurally equivalent to classes - any degree of preconfiguration can be a class.<br/><br/><br/>So, to combine the two together, create a set of characters that are almost-half-configured and have associated traits. Players pick two archetypes, combine them, and then add some polish - assign the last couple skills and make the traits make sense together. In a system that already pre-assigns pretty heavily, you'd have to do some reverse engineering to decompose the classes and make it work, but it's still possible. If you wanted to preserve the classes, though, you'd have to use a more naive combination and pre-assign characters within classes and then combine archetypes for personality hints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
