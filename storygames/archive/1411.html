                    I've been meaning to post this up somewhere because it's an interesting little wrinkle we found by accident.<br/><br/>At the last Gateway convention, we played Roach.  I ended up leading a table because I'd played it before (once, months prior).  So I explained the basics from memory and a few little flips through the book and we played.  We had an awesome game, and it was only afterwards when we were discussing the other game of the Roach that tanked that I realized that we had accidentally introduced a new rule to the Roach.<br/><br/>The rule is this: it's not a conflict unless somebody rolls against you.<br/><br/>This means that you can only double your wagered Reputation chips if you can convince somebody to oppose you, usually because you've set something up that their character would not want to happen.  This means no automatic win when you do something that's so awesome everyone agrees it happens.  Oh, it happens; you just don't get more chips for it.  You have to <em>keep going</em> and find something that another player is going to take issue with.  Which means that we ended up finding and hitting player and character flags rather than doing the tempest-in-a-teapot thing that Roach can occasionally become.<br/><br/>In our game, we had more than a few scenes where the player would say something to the effect of, "And I seduce your character," and the other player says, "Okay, my character sleeps with you."  No conflict!  So the first player has to redouble his attempt, "I seduce your character and convince her to see me exclusively."  To which the second player says, "Oh hell no," and then the dice come out.  We went from "Oh, it's Paul's turn" to real engagement with what was happening.  It made for some fantastic play.                </div>

                            Interesting - here's what the rules say:<br/><br/>"If nobody opposes you in a conflict, you automatically win.  You obviously want to angle for conflicts that favor you, since you have staked some Reputation on success.  In a perfect world you will describe a circumstance so wonderfully awful that everybody at the table will want it to happen - and leave you unopposed."<br/><br/>I think I like your way better.                        </div>

                            It really worked well for us, and it made most-or-all of the escalation into escalating in more <em>personal</em> directions.  Not to tread on your designer toes, but I think I'll be playing Roach with the hack more often than without.                        </div>

                            Hey, I'm easy like Sunday morning.  The game text reserves conflict authority for the scene framer, which is fine, but giving some of that power to the rest of the group seems like a great idea.  I'm definitely going to try it.                        </div>

                            Well, frankly, having someone opposing you is the definition of a conflict.  If no one is opposing you then you don't have a conflict.  I've always read the "auto-win" rule to mean that the character is taking a decisive unapposed action which is going to boost his reputation.  This action will likely produce story meat that will LEAD to conflicts in the future as the others try cut that reputation down.  But yes, if not used in this manner and non-judiciously it leads to weak scenes about nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The fix proposed certainly and decisively solves the problem.  Basically it brings Capes's "competative empathy" requirement to The Roach.<br/>

                            Yeah, I think this hack would make a big difference to my view on the Roach.  The one time I had an opportunity to play, I was part of a big fiasco, and "say yes and don't get chips" would have gone a long way to righting it.                        </div>

                            I remember my intention was to encourage scene framers to put everything they had into creating a situation so amazing that no one would want to see it fail to come to fruition through failing a conflict - so that the framer's bet was, in effect, a reward for inventing some tasty thing everybody liked too much to oppose.  In actual play this rarely happens, because there's a tactical necessity to oppose at various times, and because even absent that urge it takes mad skillz to win the entire table over to your side.                        </div>

                            My experience was that it was all too easy to frame scenes that didn't have a real conflict.  Actual example: "Dean, I'd like to sponsor a lacrosse team.  Important to the university's spirit, you know."  No one cared.  The hypothetical: "I go lie in the gutter and scribble.  5 reputation."<br/><br/>If nothing else, I think this serves as a really useful datapoint.  It's much easier to say "go ahead and lie in the gutter" than it is to figure out how you can meaningfully oppose that.  (And I consider it an example of my single player veto tenant.)                        </div>

Now sponsoring a lacrosse team I can easily oppose - it's weak, but as a player I can make the opposition strong and compelling easily enough, and then everybody sides with me.

                            Jason,<br/><br/>While I agree that sponsoring a lacrosse team is something that you could easily oppose, it isn't necessarily something that you would want to. I think one of problems with the imploding game that ran opposite the one Josh and I were in was that people were putting out things for conflicts that no one else particularly cared about, and as a result, no one was particularly invested in what was going on. Conflicts were unopposed not because they were awesome, but because they uninteresting.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>

                            OK, I hear you Paul, but everybody has a responsibility to make the game fun.  So if your offer was lacrosse team, I'd feel duty-bound to find something to oppose that that people could sink their teeth into, one way or the other.  You want lacrosse?

                            Right, and I can totally see where you and Fred are coming from on this. I think it depends on which way you want to spin it. Is it the responsibility of the framing player to engage one of the other players, or it is the responsibility of the other players to provide opposition to the framing player? Either way is perfectly valid and workable, and I think Jesse and Judson's game fell into the gap between the two.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>

                            To be fair to the original point I think it's actually more reliable to put personal effort into scanning what others want and attacking that than it is to throw out things that interest you and hope others step up to oppose you.<br/>
<br/>
This was my initial problem in Capes.  Originally I had created a Mind-Reading/Controling Psychiatrist called The Raven.  He had an exemplar named Violet who was a 12 year old girl with mental problems and immense Sorcerous power.  *I* was invested in the struggle between The Raven's obsession with Violet's illness and Violet's uncontrolable powers.  I kept throwing down Goals and Events related to these things.... which no one opposed, ever.  In fact we all started like this, basically throwing down Goals and Events relevant to what we wanted to see our characters do and deal with and then promptly ignored each other.<br/>
<br/>
Then in the third session, I finally had a revelation.  I looked over at my wife's pile of characters and noticed they were all relatives of one another.  I ALSO know that family is a big huge deal with my wife.  So in that scene I picked up one of her characters to play and immediately introduced a Goal that would threaten the stability of the family structure she had created.  BOOM!  The game and the system took off like lightening.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect The Roach is ultimately much the same.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a thread a long time ago on The Forge that came to the conclusion that it's fun to present conflict and it's fun the resolve conflict but it's not fun to do both simultaneously.  I think that issue is what we're talking about here.<br/>

                            The real trick is when you can figure out a way to tie the stuff that you care about into the stuff that they care about.  Or better, when you can take what two <em>other</em> people care about and tie them together.<br/><br/>And the present/resolve thing is a variant of the Czege Principle, which I totally did not spell right.  I chalk it up to "a game should make the players interact as much as possible" which means, if you're presenting and resolving, you're talking too much.                        </div>

Hm.  I didn't have a problem with this in Roach as written in that there were lots of interesting conflicts.  The mechanics encourage conflicts by rewarding them.  <br/><br/>I recall being troubled a different problem in Soap.  Essentially, Soap doesn't reward conflicts -- they can only cost you.  So in order for the mechanics to come into play, someone has to introduce something which the other players [i]don't like[/i] enough that they're willing to risk/spend to stop it.  On the other hand, Polaris is driven by other players opposing -- but it also doesn't inherently cost to engage in conflicts.  <br/><br/>Basically, I prefer if the motive for conflict are the rewards from it (mechanical or otherwise) -- not because someone else introduced something you as a player dislike and want to stop.                        </div>

The Roach rewards you for winning conflicts. Roach conflicts can cost you, in two ways. First, if you brought yourself into the scene, you have to wager on the outcome. Second, even if you were framed in, conflicts that you lose effectively cost you because the winners get chips and you don't.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a bad thing, but in our game it did lead to some interesting "searching for conflicts." In one scene, I was Roach-free, and I wanted a conflict with the only other Roach-free character because I figured that way I'd have a chance of winning. I couldn't find anything that he wanted to oppose me on (given that the potential cost to him didn't outweigh what I wanted to do to him), so I eventually had to move on to a Roached character. I lost, and I got boned. That scene provided a lot of the insight that went into this thread.

I think what Josh and I were going for is slightly different. It's not that we had to find something that the player didn't like. We had to find something that the player cared out. We had to threaten something that actually mattered to the player. I'm usually the king of "No, that's ok, it's not really a conflict," but in this game, it was all about the other players finding things that they knew my character couldn't stand for. And I really liked that.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>

Well, hold on.  So in your story here, you were using Joshua's variant where you don't win if no one opposes you -- right?  That's why you needed to provoke a conflict by doing something that would incite the other player.  Whereas if you were using the basic rules, people would be more motivated to oppose you in this case.

And I really liked that.<br/><br/>I'll buy that in a sense.  That's what being the Mistaken in Polaris is about, and that worked fairly well for me.  But it seems to me that there is a subtle line between what you're talking about and what I'm talking about.  In Polaris, a given player is the designated opposition -- so the behavior is suggested by the rules.  In the open situation of Roach, who you push and how is a more subtle thing.  It seems to me to depend more on social cues outside of the rules.                        </div>

It was quite cool, as I first got accused for trying to game the system for trying to only take on people I could beat. Then people remembered that the game is a satire of academic politics, and everything made sense.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I understand that you were angling for tactical advantage, but having to fall back on a conflict in which you get brutally boned for having free will is perfect.  Hopefully it felt deterministic and unfair and made you want a d12 of your own.</blockquote>
I Roached myself the next scene and made my tormentor pay. (She had just shed the Roach, too.) It was awesome.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>

<blockquote>Well, hold on.  So in your story here, you were using Joshua's variant where you don't win if no one opposes you -- right?  That's why you needed to provoke a conflict by doing something that would incite the other player.  Whereas if you were using the basic rules, people would be more motivated to oppose you in this case.</blockquote>
Right, I see where you're coming from now. I think my perspective has perhaps been unduly shaped by the long discussion we had afterward with the players of the other game.
<blockquote>I'll buy that in a sense.  That's what being the Mistaken in Polaris is about, and that worked fairly well for me.  But it seems to me that there is a subtle line between what you're talking about and what I'm talking about.  In Polaris, a given player is the designated opposition -- so the behavior is suggested by the rules.  In the open situation of Roach, who you push and how is a more subtle thing.  It seems to me to depend more on social cues outside of the rules.</blockquote>
Also true. Actually, my experience with Polaris very much informed my play of the Roach (and pretty much everything I'm playing these days).<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>
