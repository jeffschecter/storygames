I've always been very cool with having two, even in a three player game.  Needs are grabbier, and are better springboards than Locations. Which is how I kinda prefer Fiasco.  Lean and mean.  Locations often come about fairly easy, or they have for me.  maybe not proper names for things, but I think Needs are a better use of set-up time.  They're more informative in play.<br/><br/>I mean, the whole idea of a self-contained rpg, like in the olden days of gaming, is great.  The idea of needing a computer and a printer to play a game is nuts, or that everyone needs a copy of the book.  <br/><br/>I think there are some Details that are less then optimal.  There's simply weaker Details than others, which is somewhat subjective, but also maybe not?<br/><br/>I'd be interested in getting rid of the positive and negative outcomes.  It can feel confusing in play.  Like is this outcome "good" or "bad"?  I mean, most stories that it aims to emulate build, complicate through poor decisions.  Dread might be a better emulator?  I like maybe the idea of addressing tension building in certain areas, like Relationships or even at Locations?   Maybe like having a couple Dread towers, on different Details?  Or something like that, used as a countdown clock?  Maybe like Forbidden Island, a deck of cards that escalates a Detail?  <br/><br/>A simple "good" or "bad" outcome can feel tough to assign sometimes.

I think some of the reasons it works so well are:<br/><br/>- Custom. Can represent info that can't easily be abstracted into a broader rule/thing.<br/>- Dismissable. All cards not visible can be put out of mind.<br/>- Physically located. Taps into the physical intuition capabilities of the brain.<br/>- Pagable. For some reason that I don't understand, easy to page the state back into brain after doing things other than peering at the cards.<br/>- Digestible.

I\u2019ve played Fiasco about a dozen times and have only had one unsatisfying session, which is a really good result for a GMless game. However, I think the reason I\u2019ve had these results is because I\u2019ve followed a specific recipe. Every session we\u2019ve played has been very good as long as \u201cPositive\u201d and \u201cNegative\u201d were defined in the following way:<br/><br/>*In every scene the active player\u2019s character is trying to achieve a specific goal (or something they want) and \u201cPositive\u201d equals the character achieving their goal (what the character wants), and \u201cNegative\u201d equals the character not achieving their goal (not getting what they want). The goal trying to be achieved should always be in the character\u2019s interest, as seen from the character\u2019s POV, not from the player\u2019s POV. This way you will have ambitious, impulsive characters who are in way over their heads trying to do unwise, risky and probably illegal things in humorous way; instead of, a player trying to do the \u201cbest\u201d or \u201csmartest\u201d thing for their character. For example, a \u201cPositive\u201d achievement/outcome from the perspective of a hitman is very different than that of the typical person; to a hitman a positive outcome might be murdering someone.<br/><br/>As long as you define \u201cPositive\u201d and \u201cNegative\u201d the way I do above, and make sure you know what type of story you\u2019re telling\u2014a Coenesque story\u2014and the type characters you are playing \u2014Coenesque characters\u2014you will have a very hard time messing it up and having a bad game.<br/><br/>The single time we did have an unsatisfing game was the time that we didn\u2019t specifically define \u201cPositive\u201d and \u201cNegative\u201d in the way I did above, and just left it to players to interpret the meanings themselves. <br/><br/>The game can be made to be surprisingly reliable, especially give that it is GMless. Before giving up on Fiaso try playing it with these things in mind, as long as you do so, the game is excellent and produces great stories and a great time. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Plane_Sailing" title="Plane_Sailing"><img alt="Plane_Sailing" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/045/n3A6CXMZKBE25.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Plane_Sailing">Plane_Sailing</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478379/#Comment_478379" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-02T00:43:07+00:00" title="December  2, 2018 12:43AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Fiasco in a Box as a playtesters at Metatopia 2018 last month. I\u2019ve heard of Fiasco before, but never played it. <br/><br/>I really liked FiaB. There were apparently a few places were we did things \u2018wrong\u2019 and as such the playtest was good at providing input about areas were there rules needed a little extra clarity. I have to say that this didn\u2019t impact our fun at all.<br/><br/>There were four of us in the game, and they layout of the cards to indicate relationships around the table, and the two \u2018needs\u2019 which pairs of people had worked really well from my point of view. It was good to always be able to glance at the table and easily see what the main things going on were. Having cards of different colours rather than collecting different colour dice (and whatever else is done with the dice in normal fiasco). The other players that I was with were brilliant at coming up with inspiredly horrible plans, and everyone did come to a truly sticky end. <br/><br/>One thing that was surprising was that when final positive and negative values were totalled up high positive and high negative were pretty OK, but middling was a horrible end result. I wasn\u2019t sure why high negative ended up so good for people. <br/><br/>I imagine that additional play sets being decks of special cards would make them more expensive than a few pages in a booklet, so I don\u2019t know what that would do with after market sales. <br/><br/>Bottom line is that I would expect this would make the game much more approachable as a \u2018party game\u2019 kind of thing, that ordinary people could pick up and play without knowing anything about RPGS per se at all.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478384/#Comment_478384" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-02T07:23:38+00:00" title="December  2, 2018  7:23AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Plane_Sailing" rel="nofollow">Plane_Sailing</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One thing that was surprising was that when final positive and negative values were totalled up high positive and high negative were pretty OK, but middling was a horrible end result.

I mean, I know the mathematical reason, because I can do the arithmetic, but I don't know why the decision was made. In play, it does mean that if you're angling for a good, or not-bad end, for your character, you want to do what you can to get as much as possible from either the positive or the negative end. But then, it's also good not to fret about that and just play things as they lie.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478385/#Comment_478385" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-02T07:53:42+00:00" title="December  2, 2018  7:53AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2018 7:54AM by hamnacb.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it was genre emulation: total loosers and lucky bastards tend to 'win' or at least get away with their shit in Coen Brothers and Guy Ritchie movies, while being everyone else usually really suck.

Even my worst game of it basically worked (one player responded to every petition of the mutual Need with, "I don't know why I should do that"). Having premade cards could be a really cool addition, especially for people like me who like a nice physical component in games. I'm also excited to hear that the epilogue is being compressed into one vignette rather than a round robin (I usually go with the former anyway, even if the other players want to do it in stages).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
