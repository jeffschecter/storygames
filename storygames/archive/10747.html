In Jason's follow up message he posted, "So, basically, what I think of as typical RPG art. The painfully specific images might be typical indie RPG art - like your GMless one-player game about the Detroit riots of 1968."  Which made me think a little harder about something I posted in another thread about how I lack the gamer ability to get excited by imagery like astronauts riding on dinosaurs on the moon shooting lasers at Nazis in battlemechs.  I don't think, however, that substantive play need go so far as "painfully specific" and topics like "Detroit riots of 1968."  Sure, there's games like A Flower For Mara or even Jason's own Grey Ranks which deal with a painful reality.  However, I think one can address serious issues and raise emotionally relevant questions and still have a lot of fun and excitement with the aesthetics.<br/><br/>So here's what I want out of this thread.<br/><br/>1) Share an aesthetic that you find fun and exciting.<br/>2) Tell us what personal real-world emotional issue that aesthetic speaks to within you.<br/><br/>For me it's the Gothic.  Not the pop-culture phenomenon known as Goth and certainly not Gothic-Punk but tried and true 18th Century Romance Era Literary Gothicism.  A man haunted by the spirit of his dead sister.  A lich embracing his still living young lover.  A rapier wielding duelist bent on revenge.  A mad monarch forsaking his wife to marry the once fiancee of his dead son.  An angel walking through a graveyard in the moon light.  Stain glass falling upon a weeping sinner confessing to god.  This stuff, while often creepy or disturbing is still fun and an awe inspiring to me.<br/><br/>Why it speaks to me is summed up in the phrase, "the most tragic thing in life is that love is not enough."  There's a sense of almost adolescent confusion running through the Gothic.  Why is our personal emotion not enough to judge reality?  Why is it that if I love someone that doesn't automatically mean they will love me back?  If I feel *faith* to the very core of my being why does that not make it true?  If emotion so *easily* overrides observation and reason why is it so ridiculously unreliable?  What cruel God instills such a faulty compass in his creation?<br/><br/>So what's yours?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238464/#Comment_238464" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T17:03:50+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  5:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 5:10PM by Burr.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me it's the chiaoscuro combination of fairy tales and horror, leavened with grim humor and an illusion of epic scope, especially when the protagonist is psychologically abnormal, like the boy who was too stupid to be scared.<br/><br/><i>Brothers Grimm</i> (at least the spider horse scene and a moment or two at the tower; the rest is too hokey)<br/><i>Nekojiru-so</i><br/><i>The Cat with Hands</i><br/>American McGee's <i>Alice</i><br/>"Catskin" by Kelly Link<br/><i>Hainabe Renmei</i> somewhat, at the edges<br/>"Hansel and Gretel"<br/><i>Dragons of Babel</i> (particularly the first half)<br/><i>Book of the New Sun</i><br/><br/>(Wow, lots of cats and witches in there.)<br/><br/>Such stories make goosebumps a religious experience.  They can be about coming to grips with the idea that horrible consequences are inevitable by showing just how absurd a fantasy of escaping justice can become.  But they can also be about how a full pardon may be possible despite the absurdity.  Horror and grace.  Emotionally, then, they tend to be about anxiety and guilt on one side, but euphoria on the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238466/#Comment_238466" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T17:13:49+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  5:13PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 5:16PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>1) Share an aesthetic that you find fun and exciting.<br/>2) Tell us what personal real-world emotional issue that aesthetic speaks to within you.</blockquote>\n1) Chase scenes (and some fight scenes) in cartoons.

Stories about people who are unravelling at the edges, whose ongoing success depends upon ignoring the consequences of their actions, which is ever harder to do and ever more emotionally disfiguring, implying a breaking point. Where the world wants the protagonists to give up and wise up, but they don't, even though continuing is foolish. Deeply psychological.<br/><br/>Movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Fight Club, Thelma &amp; Louise. Dystopic fiction, often.<br/>Games like My Life With Master, Don't Rest Your Head.<br/><br/>2.) When the world says "give up" and the protagonists say "no", it isn't static. It forces a deeper plunge, a higher risk. Saying no ups the ante, it drives the story. It's a breaking-point narrative. One interesting thing here is that at the start, means and ends are pretty balanced... but as the world pushes, the protagonist is forced to become more and more assertive in their means... often to the point where they lose sight of the ends, becoming monsters who fail to ask "wait, is what I'm doing still the right thing?" Or, they ask that when they've already swept themselves up in something they can't get out of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238475/#Comment_238475" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T18:13:39+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  6:13PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't really think of anything that I don't like under the right circumstances - oh, except I don't like games where I can't joke around and relax.

I know "darking up" something or making it "realistic" is kind of a cliche, but there's something there. <i>Wicked</i> rocked my socks off; I loved seeing Bruce Wayne gradually become Batman in <i>Batman Begins</i> (I really really love that scene where he doesn't have the costume all together yet, and he's got a ski mask on). <i>American McGee's Alice</i> had some really strong potential, and was brilliant in a few places, although in general it didn't capitalize on that potential (probably because American McGee is a level designer, not a writer). I even liked the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> movie.<br/><br/>Here's the thing: people say "dark" or "realistic," but what they really mean is "compelling." This sort of thing is about taking something innocent and dreamy, and injecting experience and consequence into it. It breaks you out of the fantasy and says, "Yeah, if this were true, there'd be consequences. Face 'em, bitch."<br/><br/>That's not a really good explanation, but it's the best I can manage at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238618/#Comment_238618" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T15:27:15+00:00" title="October 21, 2009  3:27PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>*snip*</blockquote>\nWell, that's almost exactly what I'd say, so I'm just going to quote you.

(Those are fun, but not what I mean here.) I'm talking about the Knights in Armor and La Belle Dame Sans Merci, I'm talking the Red Branch and Arthur and Roland. And, in a certain sense, I'd even include that great satire and murderer of the genre, Don Quixote. <br/><br/>Funnily enough, its the Man of La Mancha that best sums up the human issues the genre hits me with: the confrontation between the human and the heroic; the brilliant triumph and utter, total, devastating failure of love, idealism, and hope; and the decisions we all have to make about whether or not we're going to live by our ideals in a fallen world, or say "OK, I'll be part of this world." <br/><br/>So when I see <a href="http://www.naergilien.info/queenmaeve/QueenMaeve.jpg" rel="nofollow">Leyendecker's Queen Meave</a>, or <a href="http://www.illusionsgallery.com/LaBelle-Dame-Dicksee-L.jpg" rel="nofollow">Sir Frank Dicksee's La Belle Dame Sans Merci</a>, I see the echoes of that -- the hope and the failure, the innocence and its loss. <br/><br/>Punk then takes over after that, after the world is accepted as a fucked up, fallen place full of lies and bullshit. My favorite punk is the earlier stuff, Richard Hell and Patti Smith -- but fuck if I won't take it all, even modern pop-punk bullshit like Greenday. I love the aggression, the working class lack of sentimentality, the pointless and pointed rebellion, and the feeling of wanting to change a world that you know can't be changed. (Or maybe it can, but not for the better. Probably. Fuck it anyway.) <br/><br/>So give me leather jackets and <a href="http://dkpresents.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/patti-smith-horses-lp.jpg" rel="nofollow">clothespins through the lip, give me the mowhawk, the angular androgine</a>, <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8TG-BsNNjjQ/SY9L7iDi8mI/AAAAAAAAC3s/hta41B5Fp2M/s320/RichardHell.jpg" rel="nofollow">the scrawny son of a bitch with more attitude than his ignorant ass can back up, a cigarette, a gun</a>, and some <a href="http://images.chron.com/blogs/peep/Richard%20Hell%20&amp;%20The%20Voidoids.jpg" rel="nofollow">inappropriate use of pink on the album cover</a> and I'll want to tell stories about smashing it up, anarchy, and nihilism born out of too much idealism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
