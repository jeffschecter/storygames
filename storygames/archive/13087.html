I read somewhere that fighting simply to survive is a weak reason and I completely agree. Every fight is a fight to survive. In two separate (very dungeon crawly) D&amp;D campaigns I've been in, a character's dog has gotten in mortal danger, and both times the combat has become really intense. For some reason having this minor emotional motivation (saving the dog) got our group energized. "No one messes with Bark!" <br/><br/>Finding this emotional motivation is the job of the GM usually, so how do I do this <b>(without creating a lot of complexity)</b> in a GMless game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294923/#Comment_294923" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T09:33:53+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  9:33AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2010 9:34AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does the GM have to do with players reaching consensus about what matters to them?

The thing with GM-less games is that a GM has a lot of power to push a game in a particular direction, even when no one else wants the game to go in that direction. A GM-less game doesn't necessarily trend towards zany any more than a GM'ed game does. It just moves in the direction that the group wants it to go in. Admittedly, zany is easy, and a lot of groups want some silly fun. This is why Fiasco works so well. But if your group wants emotional motivation, then each of you will try to create emotional motivation for everyone else. You have the potential for much more of it in a GM-less game, frankly. In a GM'ed game, you can have as much emotional motivation as one player can remember to pull on. In a GM-less game, you can have as much emotional motivation as anyone at the table can remember to pull on, which is always at least as much as one of the people at the table, and almost always more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295142/#Comment_295142" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T07:22:55+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  7:22AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The basic issue is that some people like RPG combat as a way of blowing off steam, and other people are bored by combat/conflict that nobody has an emotional investment in.  The GM is an authority figure, like it or not, who can determine which side of this preference the game comes down on.  With no single authority figure, the group has to reach consensus, and that's a lot tougher than benevolent dictatorship.<br/><br/>One of the ways you might handle it is a shortcut mechanic: if nobody wants to play out the combat/conflict in detail, there's a rule that can be invoked to decide it.

If I like to have combat to blow off some steam, and you want emotional investment, these seem like fairly orthogonal interests. I can drive the game towards combat, and you can supply the hooks for emotional investment. We both get what we want.

If there isn't at least a basic agreement about what's going on in the game, or more precisely a willingness to meld different visions/submit one's vision (in part) to those of others, then you can't play at all, no matter the game. <br/><br/>And I second Jason's notion that steam-blowin' combat and emotional investment can be orthogonal, or even parallel/joint interests. Certainly plenty of films do their best to make us care about the outcome of fight scenes.  Caring about the outcome, if the outcome is satisfying, is probably just as steam-blow-worthy as watching a bunch of action-movie mooks get torn to shreds just for jollies. <br/><br/>I think it's important to stress two different meanings of "consensus" - one means that we all have to get our characters' objectives or goals fulfilled, every time, or we don't like it. Another could mean that we gracefully admit defeat, or concede some of what we wanted, because the rules say so. The former is more like actual parliamentary process (to use your dictatorship metaphor), while the latter, I think, is much more satisfying around the game table - we aren't asking anybody to blunt their headlong charge to victor; we're just asking that if the rules say it doesn't go the way they were hoping, they play nice about it. <br/><br/>Does that fit into what you were saying at all? <br/><br/>Lastly, I think it's good to check in with one's group to see why folks came to play on a given night; even if you don't explicitly ask "So, steam or no steam?", it's good to see where other players are emotionally and mentally, to see if they want a more cerebral or emotionally engaging game, or if they just want to kill some Bad Guys for its own sake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295346/#Comment_295346" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T10:17:00+00:00" title="September 30, 2010 10:17AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jason: All parties concerned need to take the other parties into account.  You can drive the game towards combat, sure, but you have to make allowances for me wanting to be emotionally invested in it.  I can supply hooks, but I have to take into account that while avoiding combat or surrendering outright may be satisfying for me, depending on the situation, you want to actually play it out blow by blow.  In a game with a traditional GM role, it's the GM's job to be aware of these preferences and steer things in a way that satisfies everyone.  If you have a player who's not very aware of his preferences, let alone the other players', it tends to be a minor annoyance when you have a central authority, but a game-wrecker without the central authority.<br/><br/>It's not that consensus is impossible; it's just that it requires more work.<br/><br/>Zac:  The difference, though, is that in a central-authority game consensus is formed by consenting or not consenting to what the GM is offering.  Sure, the players have to agree to what's going on, but there's a difference between one player having principal authority to propose and decide and all players having equal authority.  What you're describing is more *consent* and less *consensus.* <br/><br/>And I love the idea of checking in with the group, but I've dealt with too many Tiggers and too many people who were unaware of their own tastes to believe what anyone tells me without some independent form of verification.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

One of the least satisfying games of Fiasco I ever played was with the Boomtown playset, because we didn't really have consensus on what style of Western we were playing.  I had a Roach game go off the rails because one of the players wanted a power game where he could call the President and call in an artillery assault on his say so, and we *clearly* didn't have consensus on what genre we were playing in there.  <br/><br/>Some games are better at working with discrepancies in the consensus than others are -- I played in a great game of Remember Tomorrow at GPNW where two of us were playing in a dark, funny Neal-Stephensonian dystopian bureaucracy and two of us were playing in something out of Bruce Sterling's more violent works.  It worked, though, because I think the other players, in their turns as Controller, picked up on the genre our held characters were playing in -- so it wasn't a matter of consensus about the game, but consensus about the scene, which (oddly enough) seems to work the same way as the GM-as-benevolent-dictator model does. <br/><br/>But what it comes down to is, in a traditional GM-as-dictator model, the GM is primarily responsible for knowing what I want out of the game and seeing that I have opportunities to get it; and the GM is balancing this against the desires of the other players.  In a GMless game, all the other players are partially responsible for knowing what I want out of the game and seeing that I have opportunities to get it, and they are balancing this against their own desires.  The former approach requires sensitivity, style, and creative agenda awareness on the part of the GM; the latter approach requires them from all the players.  The two approaches certainly require different skills; you can make an argument that if GMless games dominated, we'd see GM-as-dictator games as more difficult, but they don't and thus I don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295446/#Comment_295446" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T20:27:27+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  8:27PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charleton,<br/>I think that GMless games, and games with a lot more player agency in general, have raised my bar for what I find to be tolerable/acceptable behavior from gamers. When I say this, I'm referring to the dark side of lacking agency - stupid or irritating behavior. \n<blockquote><b>Charleton said:</b><br/>One of the least satisfying games of Fiasco I ever played was with the Boomtown playset, because we didn't really have consensus on what style of Western we were playing. I had a Roach game go off the rails because one of the players wanted a power game where he could call the President and call in an artillery assault on his say so, and we *clearly* didn't have consensus on what genre we were playing in there.<br/></blockquote>\nThe Fiasco game here sounds like its main issue wasn't even something that folks really thought to consider beforehand (I never really thought about there being different types of Westerns beyond "slapstick/no slapstick"). I suppose an at-the-table discussion of style might not have made sense. But the Roach game sounds like it could have been a good time to pause and say, "What the hell, man?" and sorted it out right then. <br/><br/>I think that GMless games are good training for playing <i>all</i> games, in the sense that they can help people learn to take more responsibility for the game being a good experience, and help out folks like myself who usually GM or facilitate games. We all know how stressful it can be in a fairly traditional, centralized GM-authority situation, and doing a lot of player-agency play can help players take more initiative, not only to be creative but to help co-facilitate a good experience for everybody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295474/#Comment_295474" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T06:34:13+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  6:34AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The OP asked\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mjbauer</cite><br/>Finding this emotional motivation is the job of the GM usually, so how do I do this<b>(without creating a lot of complexity)</b>in a GMless game?</blockquote>\nYou let the players find it themselves. <br/><a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/contenders" rel="nofollow">Contenders</a>is a GMless game about fighting for a better life.

But I think part of the reason this is the case is because they go bad faster than games with a central authority, *because* that consensus is harder to reach.  In a hypothetical GM'd game of Fiasco, the GM would have had the authority to steer the vision of the Western towards his vision, and probably would have done it without even realizing it.  And the Roach example was even clearer: it was at a convention, and the player in question obviously came from an adversarial play culture where the player pushed for as much as he could get, and the GM pushed back, and what happened was somewhere in the middle -- but with no GM to push back, he went over the top really quickly.  We *did* stop the game briefly and have a chat, and he improved.<br/><br/>But I think it is *because* the consensus is more difficult to achieve that GMless games teach skills that are harder to teach in GM-as-benevolent-dictator games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295584/#Comment_295584" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T12:11:51+00:00" title="October  1, 2010 12:11PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2010 12:12PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure using a convention game as an example of <i>anything </i>is a good idea.

I find this example very interesting because it demonstrates the need for consensus -- I think when you play a lot of games with the same people you get to know where their boundaries and their interests lie, and so playing with strangers makes explicit a lot of the game-contract things that familiar play groups take for granted.

Each player is their own Heart (protagonist), one another's Moons (minor characters), and one other player's Mistaken. It not only means that everybody has designated antagonism, but that the provider of antagonism changes based on whose scene it is (which gives folks a break, I think). \n<blockquote>I think part of the reason this is the case is because they go bad faster than games with a central authority, *because* that consensus is harder to reach.</blockquote>\nThis passage reminds me that I don't quite understand why you're distinguishing consent from consensus - maybe the former is passive and tolerant, while the other indicates an active embrace of what others are proposing?<br/>I've had GMs who make some really crappy calls that are infuriating - and not in the "Zac's a bad sport" kind of way. More like "Why does Zac go through so many characters in a game where it's hard to resurrect?" kind of way. I guess my perspective is that when I hear something akin to "We need a GM to keep us in line," well, my phrasing should make it clear that I'm not a huge fan of that.<br/>I think it's much better, and healthier for the group, if the GM works to facilitate a blending of visions, not the prioritizing of his/her own (or that of a single player) over anyone else's. Unless folks really want to just listen to the GM's story; consensual play (and in the adjectival form of "consent" and "consensus", we see how linguistically similar they are; hence my confusion) is always okay. <br/><br/>As far as con games go, I think they are a good reason to clear up any excessively hand-wavey elements of one's design - unless you have some kind of Old School Revolution manifesto in the design notes, or the GM chapter, or whatever, and the hand-wavey is <i>intentional</i>. Otherwise, the time constraints and the potential for strangers to play together demand that the social contract be heavily influenced by the game text itself - if I've never met you, let alone played with you before, the game better be able to pick up the slack and make sure it doesn't leave us hanging. I think that Fiasco is incredibly hand-wavey by nature (never played Roach), and that was probably a big part of your bad experience. I know that when I sat down to play it with the Ice Station playset, my girlfriend (this being her first RPG) had a tough time getting a sense of when she should make up her mind about good/bad outcome, how "good" and "bad" should relate to what happened in the scene, "good" and "bad" to whom, etc., etc.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that Polaris is much more specific and grounded - conflict only happens when someone doesn't want something to go unchallenged in the fiction, and every conflict pits explicit adversaries against each other. Heart vs. Mistaken, every time. Moons only get to be the peanut gallery; their ideas have to get approved by either party before they can be picked up and used in the conflict. Very solid, imo.  <br/><br/>Overall, it does sound like we're sort of on the same page - we both recognize the importance of forming clear expectations of the game and of other players joining us for play. Those are hallmarks of solid design, I think, and if there are some games that haven't done that for you, I would say that is what better GMless games (okay, more <i>well-rounded</i> games, for all you rabid Fiasco fans ^_^) have to offer you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295620/#Comment_295620" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T14:09:07+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  2:09PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>What does the GM have to do with players reaching consensus about what matters to them?

The GM says such-and-so; the players accede or don't.  The dynamic is that one person proposes and decides, and the others agree or object.  Consensus is what happens when you don't have an authority.  The dynamic is that everyone proposes and decides and agrees and objects, often simultaneously, and the process continues until everyone has something they are mostly satisfied with. <br/><br/>Neither is inherently better than the other, but they are likely to produce different results.  By its very nature, the authority figure approach is going to produce something strongly influenced by the tastes and desires of the authority figure, because a lot of decisions will be made without anyone really even noticing, and a lot of things can stay implicit.  And in many game groups, there's such an ingrained culture that dictates that the GM is in charge that *not* consenting to something in the game is an unusual event.  The consensus approach, on the other hand, is likely to produce results that surprise everyone, because someone will throw in something unusual but cool; but at the same time, a lot more things need to be made explicit. <br/><br/>And, to clarify the sentence you called out, in case it needs it:  in the consent-to-authority approach, if something about the fiction isn't clear, it falls to the authority to decide, and the players to consent.  Often the authority will have some idea of how the thing should work, in which case when a player does something that contradicts that, the authority will clarify the fact.  In the consensus approach, if something about the fiction isn't clear, it may go unnoticed until there is a disparity between two players' interpretations of the fiction, and it may only be apparent in retrospect that the disparity is because of that lack of clarity.  Because of this, consensus is more fragile than authority+consent.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>I know that when I sat down to play it with the Ice Station playset, my girlfriend (this being her first RPG) had a tough time getting a sense of when she should make up her mind about good/bad outcome, how "good" and "bad" should relate to what happened in the scene, "good" and "bad" to whom, etc., etc.</blockquote>\nThat's not because it was her first RPG; that's something that every group I've played Fiasco with has struggled with somewhat.  When I facilitate, I try to explain that there is no obvious strategy: you get more extreme results if you collect a lot of the same color of dice, which is likely to help your character survive the Aftermath, but you can also just play based on what feels right in the scene or just be completely arbitrary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295814/#Comment_295814" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T09:50:14+00:00" title="October  4, 2010  9:50AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for clarifying things for me, Charleton. Good stuff.<br/>I have one question for you, though - - do you consider the stated fragility of consensus to be a liability?<br/>My gut impulse suggests that the "breaking" of consensus should lead to either a) mechanical resolution (in Polaris, f'rex, you can pretty much fight to have your way with anything introduced into play by either your antagonist or your "opposed" protagonist) or b) a pause in play to resolve the issue, however seems best. It may not go well, but if you can't resolve a creative difference with someone at the table, maybe don't play that game with them.<br/><br/>And good to hear that we're not the only ones to scratch our heads at Fiasco!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295848/#Comment_295848" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T14:05:29+00:00" title="October  4, 2010  2:05PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure how it can be anything but a liability.  But there are things you can only get from consensus, and having to reach consensus means that everyone at the table is involved and has something at stake.  So if those are things you value, you have to accept that cost. <br/><br/>And I think your two examples are different cases: your Polaris example involves a conscious difference, where A wants a thing and B wants not-that-thing.  You have consensus on the way the world is other than that, but you have conflict in that area, and the conflict is going to reveal character and enrich the fiction.  That's a qualitatively different situation than when A thinks something about the world and B thinks something different about the world -- and that leads to situations where A says, "I do this" and B says, "Wait, you can do that? I thought..."  It's not even at the level of creative differences - it's more like different interpretations. <br/><br/>And re: the Fiasco dice game:  I think that most gamers (and I use that word advisedly) are used to an element of strategic as well as tactical choice.  It *feels* like there should be something significant in the long-term game about choosing the die color -- like you should be able to help your character to win or lose, or help another character to win or lose.  But when you're rolling between 3 and 5 dice, the random element overpowers the strategic, and unless all of your dice are the same color, there are no guarantees.  The gamer instinct is to look for strategic meaning in the choice of the dice, but until you've played a game through to the Aftermath, it's hard to really grasp that there's very little strategic meaning in each choice and you're better off focusing on the tactical and letting the dice fall where they may.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295865/#Comment_295865" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T16:15:47+00:00" title="October  4, 2010  4:15PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this point, I feel like coming up with an elaborate response won't accomplish much.<br/>I can appreciate where you're coming from, and I invite you to check out <i>Polaris</i> and see what you think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295875/#Comment_295875" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T19:08:03+00:00" title="October  4, 2010  7:08PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco is GM-less, Polaris is GM-ful;

If an aspect of the fiction falls under a player's fiat than that player has special authority, which the other players can either consent to, or challenge. If there is no other sub-system for some fiction element under dispute, then a good social default is consensus, as a sort of miscellaneous category. If you've already got a default system category like GM fiat or flipping a coin, then it is tempting to use that as the miscellaneous category instead. <br/><br/>But in any case, what is actually happening is the customization of the system with the group to meet resolution (literally we are resolving questions or disputes) that came up. But this is not an inherent element of GMed vs. GMless vs. GMful play.<br/><br/>Or to ground this in experience, I've seen numerous groups of GMed games use consensus to resolve continuity disputes, and I've seen a single player naturally arise in GMless games as the manager of these questions. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295929/#Comment_295929" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T09:18:36+00:00" title="October  5, 2010  9:18AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Except that I think that the question of authority, as in who has the power of fiat according to the rules, is tied up with GM/GMless/GMful structures, because holding that authority is one of the things that GMs do.  And consensus/consent underlies all systems: because before you use GM fiat, you have to have consensus or consent that GM fiat is how this will be resolved.  Before you flip a coin or roll a die, you have to have consensus or consent that randomness is how this will be resolved.  And that's tied into the GMless/GMed/GMful nature of the game: it is the role of the GM, in part to be an authority who will decide that, for instance, questions about weather will be decided by GM fiat, while questions about wildlife will be decided by rolling on a wandering monster table appropriate to the terrain. <br/><br/>The question of informal versus formal authority -- where the formal authority cedes that power to the group at large, or where someone with no formal authority actually winds up with quite a bit of it -- is another issue as well.  Of course a group can change the source of authority in a game, and the source of authority can delegate aspects of that authority, but pointing that out is like saying "Well, yeah, but we can change the rules!"  Sure, but if you change the rules, you're playing a different game, which will probably have different results and different characteristics.   And then you get the question of who decides which rules to change and how, and you're back to the source of authority in the game.<br/><br/>And I think that the distinction between intentional and unintentional conflicts is pretty important as well. There's a qualitative difference between what happens when two players actively want different things for the world and what happens when player A assumes, "oh, it's a western, like <i>The Man who Shot Liberty Valance</i>" and player B assumes, "oh, it's a western, like <i>Unforgiven</i>." (And there is sometimes a player C, who assumes, "oh, it's a western, like <i>Blazing Saddles!")</i> This needs resolution, but handling it the same way as an intentional conflict -- where player A *wants* to play in a classic Western and player B *wants* to play in a postmodern western -- is a mistake, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295935/#Comment_295935" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T09:35:51+00:00" title="October  5, 2010  9:35AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the biggest difficulty in this is: "if the same person generates the adversity and also its resolution in an RPG, the result is boring."
