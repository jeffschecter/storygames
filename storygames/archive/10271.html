I've been trying to think of ways to run an Eberron campaign using two characters, both of which would be controlled by my friend. Kind of an adventuring buddy-movie set in a world of swords and demons and swamps and loose women.<br/><br/>So what kinds of factors do I need to take into account when trying to reduce 4E to a two-player game? Are there any suggestions on how to make it more than just one fight after another? We love the combat system, but really want to get in some fun non-combat role-playing as well. <br/><br/>Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228341/#Comment_228341" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T07:00:24+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  7:00AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>There's a pretty good amount of discussion about the combat aspects of this on RPGnet, so I'll leave that to those experts. For the non-combat bits, my thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Skill Challenge system is pretty wide-open and undefined; you'll either want to look around and see what other people have done with it, or research alternatives. The Facebook game Tiny Adventures approaches it in an interesting way; whenever you fail a skill test, you receive some penalty for some number of successive skill tests, but you accomplish your main goal. It gives out complication instead of failure.</li>\n<li>Think about the passage of time. Give NPCs to-do lists and have them actually execute tasks while they're ofscreen and the PCs are up to other stuff. Pay attention to the spread of news.</li>\n<li>On the note of NPCs, since your PCs have the same player, you've got to make some pretty interesting NPCs to interact with. Friendlies and villains alike.</li>\n<li>Remember that you can roleplay during combat! Surrender is an option. So are hostage situations, daring escapes, etc etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228342/#Comment_228342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T07:12:59+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  7:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think easiest way is to have each player run 2 characters. <br/><br/>All of the above bits , more or less apply regardless if your trying to run with 2 people or not. <br/><br/>If you don't want to run with 2 characters each, as long as you follow the basic plan for the xp budgets, your encounters should more or less work. I would suggest avoiding higher level than the party monsters and soldiers however. Each miss is going to be that much a bigger percentage of actions so soldiers will shut down two people with AC+2 then you might realise. <br/><br/>As for wanting something besides combat, if your taking a strong hand as a DM, put stuff in besides combat. <br/><br/>If your taking a weak hand as a DM, don't reward combat. Watch people avoid combat once they learn that their is no xp to be gotten there. Combat settles out a lot closer to the bottom of the priorities pile.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228553/#Comment_228553" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T02:56:58+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  2:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's some guidelines about having supporting characters coming out in the DMG2 - basically, the idea is to give the players their 1 PC, and a secondary character that's statted more like a monster (i.e., simple, to the point, built for one thing).  That secondary character could be a divinely-gifted totem animal, or a loyal retainer NPC, whatever.<br/><br/>As for two-player, one GM story dynamics, I'd look at the AP from Judd's 2 player orc campaign. <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=348339" rel="nofollow">Link</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228564/#Comment_228564" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T07:12:02+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  7:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this for a game with one player, one GM, or two players, one GM?

The player's PC is a ranger and the npc is a Shaman, allowing for a heal here or there in case the battle goes south.<br/><br/>I also granted some magic at first level that was more like 4th level and then threw some xp challenges of some note at them.

He took the best hit point progression, healing surges, and number of trained skills (which he could choose form both class lists), and then got Powers as a first-level character of both classes. This made him a little more durable than a normal level-1 character, and gave him way more options (he played Barbarian/Shaman, so striker/leader, giving him damage-dealing plus healing, and took all his build options to make himself more personally durable, ala defender). At each level, he gains powers in both classes.<br/><br/>We found it worked fairly well. The character was able to handle soft level 1 challenges without too much trouble, and that continued throughout. I didn't have to lowball encounters too much, although he did find himself fairly overwhelmed in large fights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229023/#Comment_229023" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T13:47:28+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  1:47PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite><br/>My main concern is keeping encounters reasonable, especially if I end up running a module meant for a group.</blockquote>\nIf you want to use a published adventure (not that I advise it), you either would need to use a lower level module than the PCs are (e.g., running two fifth level characters through a 1st level dungeon).
