I think the rule that any option you don't choose from the list is lost to you is great, seems like that would introduce some meaty complexity to any decision, which is cool.<br/><br/>Two things come to mind as discussion points:<br/><br/>1. The idea that "You create an opportunity for another" is tied to Instinct isn't quite intuitive for me. Not that those are incompatible, but it seems as though that could be an option under any of the skills. I wonder if adding that as a universal option to all skills would yield interesting results.<br/><br/>2. From the way you've written the Bearing choices, there is no way to have someone simply be swayed by your character without promising something in return. Maybe MCs and players can work around this when needed by promising something trivial, but I don't know if you want a system that encourages people to work around the rules instead of within them.<br/><br/>These are obviously small points; any system that strives to this level of simplicity is bound to have some areas that don't map perfectly to real-world consequences. It's also possible that in practice these don't create issues at the table, in which case ignore these nit picks. Overall, nice job creating a "generic" system that still has sone great flavor!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461175/#Comment_461175" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-18T17:25:05+00:00" title="March 18, 2017  5:25PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2017 5:33PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, RickDean!<br/><br/>I agree on your point (1), although I don't know whether it would be better to remove it or to add it as a general option. For now, I'll leave it as is. "Creating an opportunity for another" is intended mainly for action sequences - perhaps the intruder is running for the door and you throw yourself on the ground to tackle him. Here it would be very natural to "create an opportunity" - it tells us that your allies have the initiative here, not your opponent, essentially.<br/><br/>As for Bearing, yes, the promise should be relevant to the circumstances, I think. "Hey, officer, I'm part of the press corps, I swear..." -"Sure, I'll let you in without checking your ID. Just don't tell my boss, right?"<br/><br/>(Do you have a better alternative to suggest?)<br/><br/>I also figure that, in some cases, the first option would be sufficient for the PC to get what they want - in situations where a promise doesn't feel right, that could do the trick. A simple example might be giving a speech to a crowd, hoping to convince them to vote for you (or your faction): if you manage to "enthrall" them, that will most likely achieve your desired outcome. Similarly for trying to seduce someone.<br/><br/>The catch is that you don't get to dictate how the NPC reacts; only that their reaction is in line with the means you're using to affect them.<br/><br/>In general, these moves play with fairly subtle or interpretive outcomes, which depend on the group to use as creative constraints or inspiration. They're not terribly "rigorous" in application, in my view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461178/#Comment_461178" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-18T17:31:51+00:00" title="March 18, 2017  5:31PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think the rule that any option you don't choose from the list is lost to you is great</blockquote>Agreed.

Would you rather have a chance to figure out and avoid a trap, or have it spring on you and roll to see if you come out alive, dead, or just badly injured, instead?<br/><br/>Notably, the Fortitude move doesn't "erase" a fictional event; it just tells how badly it's affecting the character.<br/><br/>It's possible that you would roll three "hits" and, essentially, be able to shrug off an injury with little effect. However, first of all, you still got injured - it's just not mechanically meanignful. This could have other implications, like leaving a trail of blood behind you, being delayed, causing someone else to overreact, attracting monsters which smell blood, or whatever is relevant to the situation (e.g. if you are fight a duel to "first blood", you've still lost).<br/><br/>More importantly, that's an extremely unlikely outcome - depending on your dice, it might be much less likely than rolling a natural 20 on a saving throw. You could rely on that if you wish, of course, but it's not an attractive option!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461330/#Comment_461330" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-24T11:39:09+00:00" title="March 24, 2017 11:39AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Avoiding, sure. But I understood from your example that you can merely identify the danger by making a Cunning move, instead of avoiding it outright. My point was that if information doesn't solve the situation in itself, moves that obtain information are weaker compared to the moves that solve situations with one roll. I might have been speculating too much here.<br/><br/>You should talk about stats, and how they relate to your model, btw.

Sometimes they do; more often, however, they set up another move. This creates a nice flow, step by step, which enriches the fiction and helps the character achieve their ends (in AW, it's a +1forward; under these rules, it's a soft injunction for the MC to give the player a path forward and then hand over a bigger die if they follow it).<br/><br/>What do you want to know about stats? As written, each move has a dedicated stat. So, your character have great Instincts but not be very Cunning, for example.
