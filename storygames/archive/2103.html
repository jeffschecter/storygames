                    Let's suppose for a moment I got some money for the holidays to spend on whatever I wanted [I didn't] and that I had sufficent spare time to pick-up/read/run/play a new game [I don't], what would the wiser-than-I voices of Story Games suggest I invest said money and time in?<br/><br/>I'm looking for responses in the role-playing game/story game category.  If you want to add a secondary response in the PC game category, I would also consider that.  Suggestions do not require the expenditure of both money and time, so feel free to be creative!<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>

                            I think you'll have to give us more information about your preferences, or this thread will turn into every game designer plugging his or her own product. I mean, there are dozens of really great indie titles out there (and maybe a few non-indie ones); I wouldn't feel comfortable making a such a general recommendation. I don't even know what you've already got in your library.<br/><br/>As far as PC games, I'm always eager to plug <a href="http://a-sharp.com/kodp/" rel="nofollow">King of Dragon Pass</a>, which is a storytelling game, a strategy game, an indie game, and a wonderful Glorantha experience. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nethack&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.debian:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">NetHack</a> also provides years of entertainment, and it's free. I'm generally a bit bitter about the direction video games have been going.                        </div>

                            Fair enough, Larry.<br/><br/>I own - top of my head since I am not home peering at my library - (Indie Games Only) Spirit of the Century, Dogs in the Vineyard, CAPES, Truth &amp; Justice, With Great Power, have Zorcerer of Zo on pre-order, Prime Time Adventures....  <br/><br/>Preferences - I am a supers fan and that extends into pulp.  My wife is a converted gamer and we've learned we don't care for alot of mechanical detail in our games - d20 is too much, Storyteller is borderline.<br/><br/>I like the *idea* of fine-tuning characters in d20, but the practice is too little bang for the effort. I thought the "layering" effects of Iron Claw and Last Unicorns Star Trek games were a pretty good compromise.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>David<br/><br/>Ps. I own and play King of Dragon Pass occassionally.  Neat little game, but I always end up frustrated - I'm missing some key element of the strategy.                        </div>

                            Hey David,<br/><br/>What about something like Breaking The Ice, since your wife's a gamer too?<br/><br/>If you're into pulpy sort of games, you could take a look at Cold City too. It's a sort of Cold War Cthulhu-esque thing.<br/><br/>Just as a wild card, here's a link to <a href="http://squadronuk.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Squadron UK</a>, which is the superhero roleplaying game I grew up playing, when it was called "Golden Heroes". Very old school, completely free and rather wonderful.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I have to agree with you on KoDP. The effects of decision on the overall game strategy frequently don't become obvious until some time has passed. It's really necessary to replay the game a number of times before you can get a sense of what strategies will lead to success, which gets frustrating. But one of these days, I'm going to kick that game's butt.<br/><br/>Damn, I think you've already got all my picks for supers and pulp. <i><a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/products.php?publisherLink=mementoMori&amp;PHPSESSID=bb3060dc561cb825198e3032a2d8fb28" rel="nofollow">Against the Reich!</a></i> is also pulp, but it's an octaNe supplement so it kinda ups your buy-in cost.<br/><br/>I covet the deluxe Capes click-n-lock binder, and would love to get it whenever I have forty bucks that wouldn't be better spent on a new game.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>On the non-indie front, people say all kinds of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1713" rel="nofollow">nice things</a> about Savage Worlds.                        </div>
