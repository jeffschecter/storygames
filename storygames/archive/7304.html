Julia's ashcans have been sitting outside, on a table: she'd just put acrylic on them.<br/><br/>(They are bloody gorgeous, by the way. Each has an individual cover and then they're hand-covered with...I don't know...nice stuff...and then they've got acrylic on them...and they're hand-bound with red wool that looks like netting. Both Julia and her husband have been working on them.)<br/><br/>There was a huge and sudden shower of rain, which makes Julia scream: "Oh no!". We rush outside to rescue the ashcans.<br/><br/>When we get outside, the layer of acrylic is successfully repelling the rainstorm. The drips of water are running straight off the ashcans.<br/><br/>So, Tales of the Fisherman's Wife is waterproof. This strikes me as nicely appropriate. Mind you, it'd also have been cool if they'd looked as though they'd been underwater.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
