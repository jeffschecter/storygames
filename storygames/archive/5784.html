How it got started was the fact that I introduced Morgue to that much-maligned classic of the space disco movement, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_zMU2tX5n8" rel="nofollow">I Lost My Heart To A Starship Trooper</a> by Sarah Brightman &amp; Hot Gossip.

Yes, deliberate, put in to see if anyone really paid attention to the quality of such games and...um...things. And possibly stuff.<br/><br/>I'll make those changes, they seem pretty necessary! The first time anyone actually looked at it was when I posted it up. Written whilst travelling around the South Island of New Zealand in a crappy hire care, complete with bungy jumping and swimming on lovely beaches. It had to be the most scenic way of writing a game I've ever encountered.<br/><br/>I'll make those changes and post a revised version ASAP. Thanks all!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130632/#Comment_130632" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T14:45:42+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  2:45PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First page, second column: Or you can just <b>nubers </b> them Sarah 1, 2 and 3. (replace: number)<br/><br/>Second page, first column: If only one person <b>[is]</b> higher than the other two, and the other two are equal, then both get the D10. (bold word should be inserted into the line. Alternately, rewrite the entire line so that it's an easier read: If two Sarahs share the lowest statistic total, they each get a d10.)<br/><br/>Second page, second column: You first say "<i>The player to their right takes the role of Star Fleet Command, who always issue new orders to the Captain, whisking him off to different parts of the galaxy</i>", but then later say "<i>The player taking the role of Captain Strange states what mysterious, deadly or sexy mission the Captain is currently involved in</i>." That feels like you're giving a bit too much overlap to the two roles and failing to differentiate their duties. As written, they both are responsible for describing Captain Strange's mission. I'd keep the top set of descriptions the same, and change the lower-down-the-page description of Captain Strange's role to:<br/><i>The player taking the role of Captain Strange states what mysterious, deadly or sexy thing the Captain is currently doing.</i><br/>And then change the lower-down-the-page description of Star Fleet Command's role to:<br/><i>The player taking the role of Starfleet Command gets to say what mission that vast organization sent Captain Strange into, and what small deviations he is making.</i><br/>...that way, Captain Strange is all about the sexy, and Star Fleet Command is all about the mission and Oh-my-god-why-are-you-deviating?<br/><br/>And, like Guy mentioned, there's nothing in there about being Devoid of Emotion.<br/><br/>Finally, a rules question: Can I use my d10 I get for being the underpowered Sarah while I'm Star Fleet Command? (effectively using it as a second Evil Darth Vader die) I think I should be able to, if I narrate my Sarah showing up to fuck with your Sarah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130674/#Comment_130674" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T17:39:39+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  5:39PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback, much appreciated.
