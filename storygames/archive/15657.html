If you're interested in publishing scenarios with it, email me: graham at the domain name thievesoftime dot com. Unless you're a big company, I'll probably give you permission to write scenarios for Cthulhu Dark and reprint the Cthulhu Dark rules, free of charge.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.thievesoftime.com/news/uncategorized/the-reece-symbols/" rel="nofollow">The Dark Symbols</a> are Brennen Reece and my symbols for marking Cthulhu scenarios. They are completely free to use, commerically, non-commercially, whatever. They let you write Cthulhu scenario that can be played with any system. For example, when something nasty happens in your scenario, you might put an Insanity symbol in your text. Then, Call of Cthulhu players make a Sanity roll, Trail of Cthulhu players make a Stability roll and Cthulhu Dark players make an Insanity roll. It's really easy.<br/><br/>They're tools which I've written to support independent publishing. Jason used them to write Sukakpak; Jameson McDaniel (who I don't really know, he just emailed me) used them to write <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=97647&amp;affiliate_id=5769" rel="nofollow">Bubbles and Troubles</a>.

I'm asking because if I were to make a scenario, I'd definately want to have a combat system as well.</blockquote>\nFinally found my PDF that contained the rules I was using for Combat in Cthulhu Dark.<br/><br/><i>"When you are assaulted or suffer harm from misadventure, <b>roll your Injury die</b>. If you roll higher than your current Injury, <b>add 1</b> to your rating and describe the harm you suffer. As your Injury increases, your Investigator\u2019s condition will worsen, and while they will eventually become numb to minor pains and bruises, they will still be quite vulnerable to more lethal wounds.<br/>When your <b>Injury reaches 6</b>, you die. Describe the bloody mess that is left of your Investigator. Is your demise gruesome enough to disturb your fellows, forcing them to make Insanity rolls? You get to decide. Afterwards, make a new character. This new Investigator is connected to the first one: perhaps the new Investigator received letters from or read a newspaper article about the deceased Investigator.<br/>Combat can be quite deadly, much the fault of weapons that tear flesh and shatter bone with impunity. If you are attacked with a small or bludgeoning weapon (a knife, a cudgel, steel-toed boots), roll your Injury die as normal, but make sure to appropriately color your description based on the type of assault.<br/>If you suffer a dangerous attack or harm (hatchet, cleaver, butcher\u2019s knife, tearing claws, pistols, harpoons, car accident, etc.), an <b>Injury roll lower than your rating adds 1</b>, while a <b>higher roll adds 2</b>.<br/>With deadly attacks and harm (rifles, swords, being hit by a speeding car, claw/claw/bites, etc.), an <b>Injury roll lower than your rating adds 2</b>, while a <b>higher roll adds 4</b>.<br/>Anything more dangerous than that (hit by a train, explosion, devoured by a beast), and you will be dead outright."</i><br/><br/>and then for recovery:<br/><i>"<b>Seeking Strength</b><br/>When your <b>Injury reaches 5</b>, you can reduce it by seeking strength from the Mythos. This includes: staring into the Yellow Sign, taking the Oaths of the Deep Ones, eating a piece of Mi-Go in the hope of gaining its strength.<br/>When you seek strength from the Mythos, <b>roll your Injury die</b>. If you get less than your current Injury, <b>reduce your rating by 1</b>. Simultaneously, <b>make an Insanity roll</b> to see if the experience drives you closer to madness. Once your Injury goes below 5, you can continue seeking strength from the Mythos. And, each time you successfully seek strength, explain how your body deforms.<br/>Otherwise, any natural healing or medical assistance will require such rest and recuperation, your investigator will be out of the game."</i><br/><br/>At first glance, the stuff about weapons may seem a bit crunchy for what Cthulhu Dark is supposed to be, but it worked fairly intuitively when I was attempting a short campaign. And it still keeps the deadliness of the unknown and terrible creatures intact.<br/>Investigator: "What do you mean I'm dead? Don't I get to roll?"<br/>Keeper: "There's no way your mortal body would've remained in one piece after being struck by those squamous arms..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355818/#Comment_355818" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T16:50:16+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  4:50PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds about right!<br/><br/>The Seeking Strength rules...did I write those?
