In the old days where I played AD&amp;D weekly, we didn't use poison because it was "evil". In truth, we didn't use poison because it meant that we'd be able to take out baddies in one hit, and likewise be taken out in one hit. So we didn't use it, and neither did the GM (save for one or two traps a year). "Mutually Assured Poison Destruction" or something was the stance.<br/><br/>Since then, that's always been the way I've run games. Any genre. In fact, I played a Dune game where no poison was used. That's like Star Wars without the Force or Starships. Why? Again, because one good attack (on either side) means that the adventure ends quickly for one of the players, and he's sitting there at the table for the rest of the day.<br/><br/>In a game like In a Wicked Age, I have less qualms about using poison: Usually it will happen at the "climax" of the story, and even if it takes out a character's protagonist or antagonist, they're only "sitting out" for a few minutes before the next story.<br/><br/>So what are some ways to use lethal poisons in other games (from D&amp;D to Champions, TORG to Mountain Witch), without creating a window for someone to sit on their thumbs for 3 hours because they couldn't dodge the needle?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134844/#Comment_134844" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T08:24:46+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  8:24AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, Justin <a href="http://www.bluedevilgames.com/poisoncraft_main.htm" rel="nofollow">wrote a whole book on the subject...</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134848/#Comment_134848" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T08:35:19+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  8:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Use poisons that take some time to come into effect, and poisons that don't equal instakills. This is lame advice, but consider my perspective:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn TSOY, you need to go through BDtP to kill named characters \u2013 even when using instakilling poison. Then, to make the whole thing worthwhile, you go through flash back and retconning scenes to tell why or why not the poison affects a victim. Conflict- and fiction-wise, there's no difference between poison use and chopping of heads with doublebladed aces here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words: Use poison in a way that it can be actively fought, not just make it an agent of virtual GM fiat. In an ablative ensemble game like IaWA, other rules apply, as you already pointed out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134849/#Comment_134849" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T08:35:30+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  8:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with poison as I see it is that it gets in the way of a story. As you said, real poison just kills you, most of the time. It's a boring way to die. It's the same thing as tossing a stick of dynamite at the players. In real life, a stick of dynamite will totally kill you. But is it good for a story to take the whole group out that way? <br>No. Which is why there are rolls to resist poison and explosive damage codes tend to be comparable to other weapons, the advantage being the area effect. <br>So basically, I think the only really good way to use poison is as a plot device. It's cool for NPCs to get poisoned or for the PCs to be told that they just drank something evil and have 1 hour to find the antidote. But slipping a guy cyanide just to watch him die?

However it can also kill very swiftly when given in higher doses. It's actually a pretty bad poison in that a test was developed to detect its presence in a corpse back in the 1800s (maybe earlier, I can't remember offhand and am too lazy to wiki it), so unless you're playing a very pre-modern game it's much less useful. <br/>Let's go over a list of some "common" poisons: <br/>Cyanide: Kills within seconds in a tiny, tiny dosage. Suffocates you on the cellular level.<br/>Poison Arrow Frog: Same as above, but it stops your muscles from working and stops your heart. <br/>Strichnine: Actually survivable, strichnine is rat poison. Causes muscle clenching, paralysis, and will suffocate you to death, but takes a while to do so. Activates within about 15 minutes of consumption. Can be cured with medical treatment and takes a couple hours. <br/>Aconite: Also survivable. 5-minute onset, takes an hour to kill you and can be treated with medical attention. <br/>Rattlesnake Venom: Destroys your blood, tissue, and organs. Effects vary significantly based on amount of venom injected but large snakes will usually kill you in an hour or two. <br/><br/>My point in listing these is that, what's the adventure hook for most of these? Get your friend to the hospital in the next 2 hours or he dies? <br/>Fictional poisons are much more interesting than real poison in my opinion. <br/><br/>Drugs, on the other hand, are great for messing with characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134941/#Comment_134941" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T13:54:52+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  1:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we're talking about "what happens in the real world" (for some reason), then we have to acknowledge the utter deadliness of all kinds of things we include in RPGs. Like heavy machineguns. Those are insta-killing, too, but we seem to have no problem putting them in our games. "Oh, the five .50 cal rounds I just took to the chest did 18 hit points! Ouch. But there was poison in my sandwich! ZOMGDEAD."<br/><br/>"Poison" is color. Putting a gun to someone's head and pulling the trigger is the same as slipping cyanide into their morning coffee. It either kills them or it doesn't, depending on how we go about resolving deadly situations in our system. The extra-leet-uberness of poison is an artifact of certain game mechanics (save or die!), and I don't see a compelling reason to carry that along to everything else I play. I expect a game to have a cool way of resolving deadly situations, regardless of what implements we're using.<br/><br/>I guess that covers my answer for DitV, IAWA, TSOY, PTA, Mountain Witch, MLwM, Nine Worlds, Shooting the Moon, SotC, Savage Worlds, and the other games I'm likely to play any time soon. Which, you know, doesn't involve tips or tricks, so maybe not so useful here. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134980/#Comment_134980" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T17:03:45+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  5:03PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one of the Dune books there was that addictive poison - it only killed you whe you <i>stopped</i> taking it.

It also offers the opportunity for really tough choices, "you know that thing your character has been dreaming of getting done (find her father, kill her enemy, whatever) there's an opportunity to help you with that but the opportunity only lasts the next twenty four hours and you have to choose between following that lead, or helping out your friend who's got two days left to live."<br/><br/>And then in Temple of Doom, I just love how far Indy will go to get that antidote.

Harper and Tevis. Got both points I was going to make. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven more perspective... poison is only a "problem" in a system where you normally have a lot of buffer to character death, and poison is a shortcut through that system. This is usually a flaw of the system in question in the first place that it puts that buffer in, and then expects every contest to be about who gets killed. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me be more explicit. In D&amp;D, and games with hit points in general, these become resource management games, as you decide how much to dedicate to survival in each contest. Poison in this case eliminates that game and says, "Just roll against a save to see if you die." Actually it has a counter, which is being prepared enough to have some "cure poison" potions or spells (or even slow poison). But that's a pretty rough metagame... does the GM introduce something with poison if he knows that I haven't taken any such preparations? Does the GM use poison enough that I always have to take such precautions? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not a very impressive feature of the system. I'm betting that Justin has done a lot in his book to fix that, but I'd have to read it to be sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nChange the system. If poison is part of a resource management game, then figure out how to make it an entertaining part of play. If you're playing some other sort of game, then I'm betting that poison is mechanically no different from any other tool you'd use to kill somebody in terms of resolution. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd... one more point that I'd make. Paul's right that a poison contest is to see if you can get it inside the target. But there are even earlier contests that can lead up to this. Like having the will to even try to kill somebody. Or... how did the situation come to be that you want to poison somebody. Again, in D&amp;D killing is just so common that we never question why people are doing all the killing that they're doing. If you take a step back, and make the conflict about the brinksmanship that leads up to people wanting to kill each other - resulting often is somebody backing off that position - then you simply have less contests that are about people killing each other, and more about examining character values and such. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's controversial, to make players have to have contests to have their characters attempt certain things... it's pretty traditional to assume that the player can have their character do whatever they want, whenever they want. But that's not always very interesting. Yeah, sure, we all want to play Conan, I guess, and have a character that has ultimate deciciveness. But sometimes Hamlet is a lot more fun. An entire plot about building up the willingness to kill somebody. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139831/#Comment_139831" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T14:20:46+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  2:20PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Let me be more explicit.

Poison was no longer "roll a save or die". It gave you "ability damage", which in most cases was not even lethal in the long run. Even those dangerous "con damage" poisons were only lethal for the weak or the low level.<br/><br/>I have to say that only made poison just another boring way to drain the resources. (And that's pretty much why I usually avoid it altogether.)<br/><br/>I'd still want to see a D&amp;D "poison system" that is not as frustrating as the "roll a save or die" or as anticlimatic as "you get str damage".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140069/#Comment_140069" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T13:28:39+00:00" title="April 16, 2008  1:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2008 1:29PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can anyone who's seen Justin's book testify as to whether or not it helps with Damian's problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nDamian... if you're not enamored of how they try to make poison an entertaining part of the resource management game in 3E... maybe you aren't interested in RPGs as resource management games?
