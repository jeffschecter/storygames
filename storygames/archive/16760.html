A couple weekends ago, I ran the first scenario (England, 887) with my new gaming group. It was awesome! Having played stuff like FATE and Fiasco, the minimalist system was right up their alley. (I added a Harm stat per Jason Morningstar's suggestion, so that they could fight zombies and the sorcerer who summoned them.)<br/><br/>Well, with one exception. The rules engineer of the group took issue with how counter-intuitive it is to roll Insanity &amp; Harm under its current level. "Wouldn't traditional target numbers be more realistic?", he said.<br/><br/>Now, let me say that I find <i>Cthulhu Dark</i> to be very elegant. It has nearly everything I want, and adding Harm doesn't detract from it, imho. However, desiring to cater to the tastes of everyone at the table (and not wanting to open the monkey-barrels of <i>BRP</i> or <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>), I was obliged to hack <i>CD</i>.<br/><br/><i><a href="http://trailofdice.weebly.com/cthulhu-dark.html" rel="nofollow">Cthulhu Grey</a></i> is the fruit of my labors. This Saturday, we will tackle the second scenario (Feudal Japan, 1287), and see how it goes. Feedback is welcome. Graham is aware of its existence -- turns out that certain elements resemble an earlier draft of <i>CD</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382912/#Comment_382912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T16:53:22+00:00" title="June 20, 2012  4:53PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you!
