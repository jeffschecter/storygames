I'm glad to see T&amp;T brought the love.  My copy of the Goblin Lake give away was in the mail when I came home from Go Play NW, and it looks really nice.  Glad to know that it is fulfilling it's function.<br/><br/>Were any of your demoees persons who had not tried a role playing game before?  I'm just curious if the FreeRPG day thing brought the hobby to any new people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78072/#Comment_78072" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T09:33:14+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  9:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was only one such player, and he was in the Ramlar game.  I'm a bit saddened that he was introduced with such a horrible system, but thankfully, he had heard enough to understand that there were better games out there.<br/><br/>The T&amp;T adventure we ran was the second one in that demo, involving a boat called The Drunken Dwarf.  Man, it was <i>loads</i> of fun, and I'm glad I got to run it twice.<br/><br/>I'm kicking myself for not getting everyone's email addresses, though.  These were actually my first real official demos, so I wasn't entirely used to the setup and process, but I think I adapted pretty quickly.  I sure would love to contact those awesome players, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
