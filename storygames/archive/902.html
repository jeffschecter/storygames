                    Hello, gang!<br/><br/>I'm vacationing back home in New Orleans for the hoiday weekend, so forgive my lack of participation these last few days. That said, I could use some collective brainpower.<br/><br/>I'm due to run a session of the Mountain Witch tonight (hi, Tim) for my friends. I've never run it, but played it two-and-a-half times, and my group has never played a wacky indie hippy narrative game apart from <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16382.msg174249" rel="nofollow">one not-stellar playtest session</a> of Stranger Things.<br/><br/>Here's my group so far:<br/>C: Male, 30ish, known for 10+ years. Usually plays Rifts or Cyberpunk, casual roleplayer. Hates to make new characters and historically doesn't like to learn new systems.<br/>G: Male, 30ish, known for 10+ years. Usually runs Palladium, pratty hardcore gamer. I don't think he knows that System Matters.<br/>J: Female, 20ish, known for &lt;5 years. Usually plays Exalted or White Wolf, and a bit of D&amp;D. Dating C.<br/>K: Female, 20ish, known for &lt;5 years. Usually plays Exalted or White Wolf, and a bit of D&amp;D.<br/>D, Male, 20ish, known for &lt;5 years. Usually runs Exalted, has been reading the Forge and knows of this new style of play<br/><br/>I chose MW because of its one-shot nature, and I believe the Japanese trapping will appeal to all of my players, as they are fans of anime. (read: MW is an easier sell than Dogs.)<br/><br/>I've read the whole MW book andhave a few scenes popping in my head for pulling out of my hat. I'm less worried about my ability to run off-the-cuff and improvise as to introduce and actively encourage Narrativist (is that the right word? It'll do) play.<br/><br/>So, questions:<br/><br/>Specifically for MW, can anyone offer advice or gotchas for pushing this as a one-shot or other game issues? What works well for recording Trust- pokwer chips or stones?<br/><br/>Specifically for new players: How have you introduced thes games of ours to new players? What works, what doesn't? How can you encourage narration and press home the power that players have in this sort of game? What are good carrots, not sticks?<br/><br/>I'm sure more will come up during discussion.<br/><br/>MDK                </div>
