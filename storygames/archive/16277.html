Very interesting response to the theme of death. Thank you!<br/><br/>Saying something is a "game" gives a certain lightness to it. Having death treated with some lightness is ok, in my mind. There will be crying in a funeral anyway, so having people going about doing something else for a couple of minutes is good (they may whisper AND cry, of course). And playing a "game" over the life of the deceased is very much a proper thing to do, especially if he was an avid gamer.<br/><br/>I made a game some years ago on the theme of  <i>life</i> and <i>friendships</i>, in which death has a very strong presence. The translated title is <i>"Autumn of Life"</i> (Livets h\xf8st). It's a small game of the modern type, wherein the players depict a group of lifelong, old friends. Almost all scenes in the game takes place in the funerals of the characters. They die, one by one, but the players of dead characters continue to play them, as some kind of "whispering ghosts". They whisper "memories" to the players with living characters; shared moments of friendship or pain they had with the deceased, or simple minutiae the living recollect about the dead. It's a beautiful game to play, even though death is very much present in it, and treated with all the respect it deserves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371661/#Comment_371661" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T00:02:04+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 12:02AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I could never have this done at my funeral.</p>\n<p>"Well, he never killed every one of us with a chainsaw."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_371662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371662/#Comment_371662" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T00:11:36+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 12:11AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alexander; I reckon a lot of people would dislike the idea of doing a game at a funeral.

Standing up against a monstrously huge and fiery dragon is not something you survive! Let such a character be roasted, with a lively description"<br/>And then I went on to tell the leaders that players of dead characters should be given thanks for their participation, and asked to leave the room. No one should be given new characters, nor the chance to watch the rest of the game from the sideline. Dead character = game over for you.<br/><br/>I also instructed the leaders, in our play-test of the scenario, that they should work their ass off to make each and every scene in the game a really memorable scene. Playing this game should be a top experience for the players, wether they got to play 30 minutes or 3 hours. The quality should be in the scenes, and in <i>how the characters acted in them</i>, not in how many minutes of character-life the players got. "Help the characters come alive in each and every scene", I told them; "so they may die and leave you with a good feeling".<br/><br/>It worked very well. We had a blast playing the scenario (with a dragon), had some players die on us, with the heat of interaction steadily increasing through the whole scenario. The players really wanted to be in on the drama, as the end of it was fore-spelled in several exciting ways, and that made the game even more intense. Dying was a real threat to them ...<br/><br/>The end of the drama was tragic, and beautiful, with one central, mentally-disabled NPC climbing an altar and demanding to be sacrificed for the good of their home-village. It brought tears to the eyes of players in most of the groups. Death was very much present in this game, both as a definitive reality of individual game-end, and as a symbolic and ultimate sacrifice, elevated to the sphere where it gives meaning to a life.<br/><br/>The very fatalistic technique of "dead character = game over for you" was inspired by death itself, of course. It worked well with the theme of the scenario (a legendary trek to save the village, at any cost), to infuse it with a strongly felt, underlying acuity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371667/#Comment_371667" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T03:20:28+00:00" title="April  7, 2012  3:20AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of stating the obvious, Tomas, are you familiar with <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpg/647/deaths-door" rel="nofollow">Death's Door</a>?<br/><br/><i>Death's Door is a role-playing game for 3-5 players that looks directly at how we deal with death, as people and as a society.

I like the idea of games ending, like stories.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's figurative death too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371843/#Comment_371843" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T17:17:58+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  5:17PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was at Gothcon recently and the way most games are set up is there is a set time with several groups playing in parallell. The con is hosted at a large school with lots and lots of numbered classrooms. What if players of dead characters are simply told to go to room X. There they would awake in the afterlife. Players from different groups would mingle and adventure there together. Perhaps they are heroes from different sides in an ancient world or something. Perhaps how their character acted in the game (or just their background) gets them sent to different afterlives. And obv. daring groups can venture into hell itself to attempt a rescue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_371854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371854/#Comment_371854" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T20:04:17+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  8:04PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your idea is nice, Wilmer! It would be great to have such a room, especially as it would enable us to play with death in new ways, in the role-playing part of the convention. Could have some really interesting effects ...<br/><br/>BTW: <i>Gothcon</i> is a great place to be!
