There are a few exceptions, though.<br/><br/>* Some games aren't meant to be played - they are experiments, or weird jokes, or whatever. In those cases, it might be good to have a notice somewhere saying "I don't envision anyone actually playing this, God knows I haven't, and if you try to, I can't be held responsible for whatever happens".<br/><br/>* Some games are riddles. (Lacuna, for example). In those cases, again, the buyer/reader should be made aware of this - "This game is a riddle wrapped in an enigma singing a song about a happy coconut, and it doesn't tell you how to play".<br/><br/>* Some games assume you've played similar games before, and don't explain all their basic assumptions. In those cases, there should be text saying "I assume you've played <i>this </i>game, or <i>this </i>class of games, so I won't be explaining the terms Game Master, Bangs, Scenes, Coconuts or Presbyterianism. If you don't know those terms, you may want to play another game first".<br/><br/>So if your book isn't meant to communicate everything about the game, <i>tell the reader</i>, because there's always someone who's going to buy your book assuming you're actually going to tell them how to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75565/#Comment_75565" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T05:23:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  5:23AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's remarkably hard (impossible?) to write without making asumptions about your audience.

In many cases, explaining what framing a scene means is, in fact, overkill if you've positioned your game for experienced players.  <br/><br/>In my new game I tried to make my imaginary reader somebody new to games, which required me to spell out terms and concepts that would otherwise be implicit.  I avoid jargon like NPC and I'm explicit about defining the functional jargon that I do use.

What matters is the actual information transmitted, and if that information is incomplete and does not convey how to play the game in a satisfactory manner, then the game is indeed broken.<br/><br/>Wether a second edition, containing all the information the writerment to put in the first edition but failed to, comes out or not, that first edition is not a functional game.

That's the distinction. The smart person can notice they said something stupid, then restate properly, or get someone to help with their ability to express themselves in a way that's commensurate with their smartness.<br/><br/>Tortured analogy. Let me unanaologize but not delete that paragraph.<br/><br/>Situation 1: I have a great game. I write it poorly. People yell at me. I get someone who knows to help me and put out a version of the book that captures what's working in my playtests.<br/><br/>Situation 2: I have a terrible game. It doesn't matter how I write it. I can get people to help me fix the game and put it out again, but who knows if I can? Maybe the game concept is fundamentally broken. Maybe I don't have it in me to create a good game.<br/><br/>Situation 1 is a lot more hopeful than situation 2. <br/><br/>I think it also has to do with the whole system-is-not-just-what's-written-down thing.<br/><br/>Let me be very clear again, to most people situation 1 and situation 2 look identical.

Most people play it for the first time at a game store or gaming convention or friends' house, where they are taught by someone experienced with the game. They, too, were taught.<br/><br/>I bought the game because I heard so many awesome things about it, and played it with a group who never experienced it before.<br/><br/>The first game sucked. SUCKED.  Literally, the instructions tell you the bare mechanics of how to manipulate the board and pieces. Nowhere does it tell you why you are doing it so, or how you should do it. It just presents the bare minimum to call an instruction book "instructions", and says "go!". (note that these are typical german board game colorful glossy-paged instructions, not a hackneyed translation or anything like that) Comparing it to a game like Settlers of Catan, which is a majestic "night and day" difference in guiding first time players.<br/><br/>Now, in the playing of the game RA, you come to discover the whys and the hows. But guess what, your first game (IF playing in an all-newbie group, where you nor anyone else has played before) is almost destined to Fail, unless you've been previously taught/training on how to play the game. The instructions are confusing, they *are* readable but without understanding the intent behind the rules, it's easy to forget or misinterpret rules. The game starts and stops. People have to constantly reference or re-reference the rules. Lots of "Wait... that can't be right?"s.<br/><br/>Once you get through a game of RA, you will understand quickly the hows and whys, and your Next Game will be much more fun. Your Third Game will probably be very fun, and will continue that way forward. When you introduce the game to others, you will be able to explain the strategies and pitfalls, the expected behaviors and play tips. <br/><br/>And it's not like the instructions will be worthless at that point: Once you understand the flow of the game, and have experience with it, the rules serve as a great reference.  Forget how many tiles to place, or how many auctions before the Epoch ends, or what you can do each turn, or how tiles are scored?  The RA rules are great. They don't explain the game play well, but they help you reference the data behind the game (data).<br/><br/>A lot of parallels can be drawn with existing games, like Sorcerer. It's really hard (impossible? depends on the person and the reading) to understand the game from the "instruction book". However, it is still a great reference for the data, do's and don'ts, and finer points - Once you've already played the game once and understand how it works.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75664/#Comment_75664" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T11:27:20+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 11:27AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But is that desireable?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75670/#Comment_75670" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T11:43:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 11:43AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to throw something else into the mix, how does this compare to a game that is itself incomplete without the purchase of several other books?

It didn't seem that he liked what he saw as a current trend with published unfinished games that didn't get tested enough. Shock has unfortunately come to represent such a game for me. It's probably unfair to the author and the game, but that doesn't change the fact that when we tried to play it as written we had problems with who had authority where and when. But does that make it worthless? I don't think so because even with those problems we had moments of greatness during the first time we played it. Also the author did answer Matthijs' questions and was helpful and so the second time it went much better and I had a great time. Still using the example of Shock I would say that although I had a great time, I wouldn't buy it as it is today. A second edition with more playtesting and with some omissions corrected I would very much like to buy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76149/#Comment_76149" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T19:55:25+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  7:55PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To go back to an earlier point:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>But I do think there's a shading of difference between failure to transcribe effectively from brain and failure to design properly.</blockquote>\nNot to the end-user.  But let's take a moment to not look at this for the typical indie model.<br/><br/>This isn't necessarily the responsibility of the author, and definitely not the responsibility of the reader -- it's the responsibility of the publisher.  The publisher should take the author's text, hand it off to playtesters, editors, peer-reviewers, and make sure the text (whether it's a game or not) is ready for prime-time.<br/><br/>Now, to go back to the typical indie model, author and publisher are the same person.  The problem isn't necessarily that the author can't write for shit.  It could be that he needs to <em>learn to be a publisher</em>.  Again though, there's no difference to the end-user who bought a crappy book.  But there is a difference in someone needed to improve their writing skills versus someone needing to improve their publishing skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76312/#Comment_76312" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T20:27:53+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  8:27PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This specific problem (i.e., the type of 'incomplete' being discussed) comes about as the result of an author assuming that the reader has an intimate familiarity with his internal thought processes. That is, things are left unexplained because the author forgets that Joe Consumer wasn't privy to the design process or the thought process that drove it. <br/><br/>This problem is hardly unique to small-press publications (the MURPG, for example, suffered from this problem in spades). The issue isn't one of poor design so much as it is one of poor language skills. It's a <i>writing</i> issue and a common one, at that (specifically, it's an issue of the author being a poor <i>technical</i> writer).  <br/><br/>An author needs to remember that they are not the audience. As simple as that sounds, many game designers forget this most basic rule of writing. The audience won't know how to use the rules unless they are <i>told</i> how to use the rules. Likewise, the audience won't know what the author was thinking when they wrote a certain rule unless the author takes the time to explain it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76516/#Comment_76516" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T15:01:39+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  3:01PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The issue of unfinsihed games also does not apply only to story games. There is a worrying trend in console gaming at the moment where games are rushed to completion and then finished with patches at a later date. The worst thing of this is that a lot of companies use micro-transactions to dispense the patches meaning consumers have to pay twice for it. <br/><br/>To me a game should be as finished as the designer can make it. By this I mean he has playtested, and preferrably rewritten it, several times over and then has given it to a group who has no idea about the game and asked them to run it. This last part is invalubale as it means you get to see how well you have explained the game. Do anything less than this is just dowright shoddy design and shows through.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76522/#Comment_76522" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T15:37:15+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  3:37PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2007 3:37PM by Shevaun.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll give you a game I don't think was finished, and its a big-license mainstreamer as well. Anyone tried reading the new Battletech RPG? I swear to god, 50-something pages in, trawling through an ungodly-unweildy life-path character gen system, and I still have no idea what we're playing. It presents itself as Shadowrun with mechs, but then its political, or you're samurai, or, um. Nothing. Flavour text and quick paragraphs saying things like "mechwarriors are super-elite, and are highly respected in their clans", but no sentences along the lines of "In this game you will be playing a character from one of hundreds of planets and dozens of races, trying to eke out an existence in a war-torn galaxy, as a soldier, criminal or just an average citizen trying to get by."<br/><br/>So in my opinion, it is incomplete. The system is there, huge, full of fun new terminology, lots of detail and all, but you don't get to know what the game <i>is</i>. This is a classic example of omission by presumption, and it's a bad presumption at that, that really old setting material scattered over dozens of books, will be common enough knowledge amongst gamers to justify leaving it out, and worse, that if you had that setting knowledge, you would immediately <i>get</i> how to play the game. A game which professes to be totally new and different. Morons*.<br/><br/><i>*sorry, I've been stressing about this game for ages because MechWarrior is such a lovely setting with such potential, and I still can't bring myself to say anything good about their game. Hell, how many ways can you get the "Drive Tractor" skill, anyway?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
