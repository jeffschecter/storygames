Keep that in mind.<br/><br/>The following excerpts from my work are a little bit lengthy, but are actually a pretty succinct summary of the psychological justifications for interest in this area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Narrative Interventions<br/><br/>\tPerhaps the most convincing research on the latent therapeutic power of narrative has been performed by James Pennebaker and others over the last two and a half decades. These studies have mostly utilized \u201cexpressive writing\u201d techniques, in which participants write about their thoughts and feelings over the course of the study. What has made this research so striking is that by writing for around 20 minutes a day, for as few as three or four days in a row, participants improve their long-term outcomes significantly. Improvements are not only apparent in affect and mood (Murray et al, 1989, for example) and emotional coping strategies (Spera, Buhrfeind, &amp; Pennebaker, 1994, for example), but even in physical health effects as assessed by such measures as physician visits (Pennebaker &amp; Beall, 1986) and immune function (Esterling et al., 1994).<br/><br/>Indeed, in 1999, Pennebaker and Seagal recognized the breadth of the positive implications of narrative in their paper, \u201cForming a Story: The Health Benefits of Narrative\u201d. It seems that the construction of a story, any story, is potentially useful as long as it forms meaningful causal links between emotionally salient personal feelings and experiences and cognitive explanations of such feelings and experiences. Pennebaker and Seagal summarize some of their views (p1249):<br/><br/>"These findings are consistent with current views on narrative and psychotherapy in suggesting that it is critical for the client to confront their anxieties and problems by creating a story to explain and understand past and current life concerns. The story can be in the form of an autobiography or even a third-person narrative\u2026 In our studies, as in narrative therapies, the act of constructing the stories is associated with mental and physical health improvement. A constructed story, then, is a type of knowledge that helps to organize the emotional effects of an experience as well as the experience itself."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Role of Fiction<br/><br/>\tPennebaker and his colleagues have demonstrated the impact of autobiographical narrative. However, identification of the mechanisms behind these profound benefits is still in its early theoretical stages. Pennebaker and his colleagues propose that narrative may decrease ruminative-like thinking and that the narrative processing of events may also lead to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional changes towards healthier outcomes (see Esterling et al., 1999, for a review).<br/><br/>If this is the case, then how does it intersect with imaginative play and the generation of fictional narratives? Little research has been performed on how fiction and autobiographical narrative intersect. Can the construction of fictional narratives achieve the same kind of effects as autobiographical ones? <br/><br/>A study by Greenberg, Wortman, and Stone (1996) suggests that they can. These researchers found that previously traumatized students achieved comparable benefits when they wrote about an imaginary trauma as when they wrote about a real trauma that they had experienced. <br/><br/>Therapeutically, this might have special significance. Fiction has some qualitatively different attributes than does autobiographical nonfiction, and may therefore have some unique strengths. Mar et al, in 2006, found that subjects with greater exposure to fictional, narrative literature fared significantly better on tests of empathy than did subjects who favored non-fictional, less narrative books. Furthermore, by its very nature, fiction may be capable of cognitively simulating a wider range of experiences than non-fictional autobiography, possibly while still maintaining similar emotional salience. There is some evidence that the processing of real-world events and certain fictional events are very similar subjective experiences (Gerrig 1993). Certainly, fictional experiences can have impactful, real-world cognitive and emotional consequences (Harris 2000). The kinds of behavioral changes that these impacts can instigate seem, intuitively, to be of the same family that Pennebaker and others describe when discussing expressive writing. As far as fiction is concerned, it seems likely that some form of investment of personal significance must be achieved in order for these kinds of effects to be realized. Should our storygame intervention prove to be ineffective, lack of involvement of the self is one of the first places to look for possible shortcomings.<br/><br/>Play therapy has become fairly widely practiced with children. Experts in the field seem to believe that it\u2019s effective, but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that very little empirical research exists to show whether this is the case. Still, tangential evidence does suggest that children\u2019s play has far-reaching implication on their development. Inge Bretherton (1989) reports his findings that children who are more predisposed to use fantasy are also likely to have higher ratings of cooperation, social competence, and peer acceptance. In \u201cDissociation in Children and Adolescents: A Developmental Perspective\u201d, Frank Putnam reports that, \u201cFantasy play is an important arena for the mastery of emotion and the transformation of self-perspectives. The child\u2019s success in slaying make-believe dragons contributes toward mastery of anxiety provoked by real-life tasks. Fantasy also provides an important domain in which unpleasant aspects of reality can be \u2018fixed\u2019 and painful affects can be safely and privately discharged.\u201d (Putnam 1997, p190). With this study, we hoped to contribute to the scant empirical research on play therapy, and to open the door to the possibility of its use, in some form, with adolescent or even adult populations.<br/><br/>The potential of fictional simulation for therapy has also, to some extent, been captured by the domain of drama therapy.  Though very little is known about significant causal relations, drama and role-taking have been linked with verbal ability, theory of mind, empathy, and adaptive emotion regulation (see Goldstein 2009 for a review). Schellenberg (2004) discovered, in a study of the impacts of lessons in keyboard, singing, and drama, that drama was the only group to show significant improvements in adaptive social behavior. This is promising for our storygame condition, which includes substantial opportunities for practice in role-taking and acting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222542/#Comment_222542" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T18:05:19+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  6:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This information is still only skimming the surface of the theory and research applicable to this area, but you are asking such a big question that this was the briefest way I could answer it and I still maxed out the post limit :-P.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222543/#Comment_222543" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T18:14:22+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  6:14PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly what I was after.

I will try to answer it whenever you'd like. I was stating that it was not the question I was presently engaged with, so as to avoid confusion. Looks like I didn't entirely succeed, so apologies on that count!<br/><br/>(1) They are referring to the predominant view in "talk" therapies that "it is critical for the client to confront their anxieties and problems by creating a story to explain and understand past and current life concerns." Before Pennebaker, there was very little empirical support for the idea that talking about one's experience was advantageous. So, before Pennebaker, it was a "broad-based meta-theoretical sort of conviction", as you said. With the expressive writing research, it was found that when clients link their emotions with their experiences, and express a story about that link, the health benefits are the strongest. So, I think Pennebaker is referencing that and the replicated empirical finding that expression of personal narrative has health effects, and tieing those empirical results to the older theoretical "conviction".<br/><br/><br/>(2) Interesting question. Of course, we are now leaving the empirical zone, so even the eminent theorists on this subject are only conjecturing.<br/><br/>Gregory Bateson discussed many of his ideas about the nature of play in his books \u201cSteps to an Ecology of the Mind\u201d and \u201cAngel\u2019s Fear\u201d. For Bateson, the key to conceptualizing play lay in its nature as an extra-symbolic system. Trevor Pateman succinctly summarized some of Bateson\u2019s key ideas in the essay, \u201cPlay: Children\u2019s Play and Adult\u2019s Play from the standpoint of Gregory Bateson and Donald Winnicott\u201d;<br/><br/><i><br/>Teachers and parents like to think that they approve of children playing, that they believe children learn and develop through play. They may remember that someone once said that a Child's Play Is Its Work. Yet, equally, children's play is a source of anxiety to these same teachers and parents. They may have come to terms with Doctors &amp; Nurses, but Cowboys &amp; Indians or more contemporary versions of violent shootouts leave them uneasy, as does the way children gravitate towards sex-stereotyped toys and ploys for their play. <br/><br/>The unease might be relieved if we saw more clearly what Play is, appreciating its particular unreal, fictional and symbolic character. For Play - the genuine thing - is twice removed from reality, not once removed. An angry boy who shapes two fingers into a gun, points them at the object of his anger and fires (`Piaow, Piaow'), is using a representation (of a gun) in expressing the anger he feels. His action is once removed from reality, in the sense that it represents an attack on the hated object rather than actually being an attack with fists or stones or whatever happens to be available. But the attack, though it involves a representation (the image of a gun rather than a gun), is still located very much within a real relationship with the person who is the target of the aggression. So it is appropriate to respond to it within the context of a real relationship. The target of the aggression might meaningfully respond with such words as, "Now, now. Temper, temper".<br/><br/>But when in a game, a boy makes an imaginary gun from two fingers, points at a playmate [note the word!] and fires (`Piaow, Piaow'), there is no anger, and there is not a real relationship but a symbolic relationship between play-aggressor and play-victim. It is not appropriate for the playmate victim to respond, "Temper, temper". The playmate-victim should simply duck to avoid the imaginary bullet, or clasp his hand to his chest, gasp, crumple to the ground and put on a decent display of death throes - perhaps good enough to win some applause.</i><br/><br/><br/>Another theorist is Roger Caillois, but I am not familiar and cannot vouch for his work.<br/><br/>I wrote a theoretical paper on the subject of "narrative as play" years ago, but it is 36 pages long and I won't go into its ideas here unless folks want to discuss the subject in exquisite detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222587/#Comment_222587" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T21:03:00+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  9:03PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Antiquitus</cite>...unless folks want to discuss the subject in exquisite detail.</blockquote>Is there any other way to discuss a subject?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222599/#Comment_222599" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T21:43:53+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  9:43PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bateson!

I was happy with StoryJam, but then went to storyjam.com and saw that a possibly sketchy Disney-affiliated think tank organization owns that copyright. I assume I can still use the words Story Jam if I separate them? I am not sure about copyright law, though. As a side note, Willem Larsen, whom I admire, coined the term in this context. <a href="http://www.mythic-cartography.org/what-does-storyjamming-mean" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mythic-cartography.org/what-does-storyjamming-mean</a>.)<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I did not consciously design story jam to meet the goals of an experimental story game intervention. Story jam evolved out of my efforts to design a \u201cuniversal\u201d story game framework or \u201ckind of play\u201d that satisfied me. Without going into the details of my design process, story jam is the result of my crew and me starting with some PDQ-like adventure RPing (see Ogre Whiteside\u2019s \u201cBridge\u201d system), stripping away piece after piece that slowed us down (character monogamy, conflict resolution mechanics), and adding pieces that facilitated the experience we wanted (personal vulnerability chips, hierarchical themes). So, it was an organic thing, which resulted in a kind of play that meets my personal story gaming needs very well.<br/><br/>But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. Actually, I think I must misunderstand your question, because it sounds like you\u2019re asking a very simple question of \u201cHow does story jam tie to your psychological exploration of narrative?\u201d<br/><br/>If this is your question, the answer is:<br/><br/>1)\tIt is the method I personally have found very exciting and effective for exploring my own deeply personally relevant themes and stories.<br/><br/>2)\tIt is a method that seems to foster a rapid learning curve in creating personally relevant stories alongside community trust in a relatively safe environment. If Pennebaker and colleagues are correct that narrative therapy works best when people link highly personal themes with stories that make sense, then story jam seems well positioned to test this in terms of story games.<br/><br/>If this doesn\u2019t answer your question, then please help me answer it better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas" title="Jiituomas"><img alt="Jiituomas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas">Jiituomas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222610/#Comment_222610" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T23:00:15+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 11:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Bill: Callois will get you some good angles on play, but not that much on narrative.

In this game it is turned on creative writing education. Participants learn how to overcome shyness about making things up by playing an interactive story telling game. <br/>\n<br/>\nKEYWORDS<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial matrix game, creative writing, college freshman, Romeo and Juliet<br/>\n<br/>\nBASIC DATA<br/>\n<br/>\nThe \u201cCreative writing social matrix game\u201d is meant to help beginning writing college freshmen to overcome embarrassment and shyness regarding making things up in creative writing and teach them that this is what the instructors want them to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game simulates collective writing collaboration skills. A story is told in such a way that the participants see it could easily have come out very differently. The participants enact creativity as they play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe debriefing period consists of a discussion of the participant\u2019s experiences of play and a clear message that they can do this outside of the game. The extent of the participants learning is tested in a home work assignment. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe target audience is college freshmen beginning writing students.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay time is 30 to 45 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebriefing is 30 to 45 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA minimum of five active participants are required but there can be as many non-active observer participants as the facilitator desires. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach active participant needs pen and paper, five action tokens, one six-sided die, and a character description provided by the facilitator. <br/>\n<br/>\nDebriefing is done by a discussion followed by a writing home work assignment. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game can be played via email but it is intended to be played face to face so the participants encounter the most emotions so they can work through them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe facilitator needs a story opener write up, and a \u201cTo happen\u201d table to set dice rolls.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222647/#Comment_222647" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T05:25:24+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  5:25AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            INTRODUCTION<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginning students of writing are frequently blocked by fears about being creative (there must be literature on this). Their creative energies remain locked up by self doubt (there must be literature on this). The Social Matrix Game is an inexpensive low tech game mechanic that can help students break through their fears so they can give themselves permission to be creative in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe \u201cCreative writing social matrix game\u201d uses the well-know play \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d and puts the players in the role of author. They start at the beginning of the play but then get to rewrite the story through a collective interactive process. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is best played with 5 to 10 players. It lasts 30 to 45 minutes with a 30  to 45 minute debriefing period right after the session. It requires a game facilitator to run and can be watched by other students who can also gain lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory Opener: [The facilitator reads this to the participants.] The Montagues and Capulets are two rival families in the city of Verona. Romeo Montague is an impulsive young man in love. Juliet Capulet is equally impulsive and about to be betrothed. No one wants them to come together. No one wants them fall in love. They are on a collision course with fate. What happens is up to you. The play starts with a brawl between servants of the two families which is broken up by the Duke. Anyone caught fighting after this will be banished! [The facilitator now assigns characters to participants.]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Characters:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis game can be played with 5 participants. Below is the order characters are added in after the first five. As the game is played participants may create new characters to help tell the story they want to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tRomeo: Son of the Montagues; the male protagonist<br/>\n2.\tJuliet: Daughter of the Capulets; the female protagonist<br/>\n3.\tTybalt: Cousin of Juliet, nephew of Lady Capulet<br/>\n4.\tMercutio Another kinsman of Prince Escalus; a friend of Romeo<br/>\n5.\tFriar Lawrence: a Franciscan friar and Romeo's confidant.<br/>\n6.\tNurse: Juliet's personal attendant and confidante<br/>\n7.\tLady Capulet: Matriarch of the house of Capulet.<br/>\n8.\tLord Montague: Patriarch of the house of Montague<br/>\n9.\tCount Paris: Kinsman of Prince Escalus; desires to marry Juliet<br/>\n10.\tPrince Escalus: Prince of Verona<br/>\n11.\tBenvolio: Cousin and friend of Romeo.<br/>\n12.\tLord Capulet: Patriarch of the house of Capulet.<br/>\n13.\tPeter: Capulet servant, assistant to the nurse.<br/>\n14.\tLady Montague: Matriarch of the house of Montague.<br/>\n15.\tRosaline: unseen character with whom Romeo is in love before meeting Juliet.<br/>\n16.\tApothecary: Druggist who reluctantly sells Romeo poison.<br/>\n17.\tAbram and Balthasar: Montague servants<br/>\n18.\tSamson and Gregory: Capulet servants.<br/>\n19.\tFriar John: Another friar who is sent to deliver Friar Lawrence's letter to Romeo.<br/>\n20.\tThe Chorus who gives the opening prologue and one other speech.<br/>\n<br/>\nMAP OF VERONA<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main square<br/>\nThe cathedral<br/>\nThe streets<br/>\nMontagues\u2019 home<br/>\nCapulet\u2019s home<br/>\nThe Garden<br/>\nJuliet\u2019s room<br/>\nThe monastery<br/>\nThe graveyard<br/>\n<br/>\nPadua \u2013 place of exile<br/>\nApothecaries shop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFACILITATOR\u2019S GUIDE<br/>\n<br/>\nThe facilitator starts the game by reading a story opener. This tells the participants where the game is set, who the characters are and that the object of the game is to tell a different story than Shakespeare did. The facilitator assigns characters to participants who read a short character description out loud to introduce themselves. The character descriptions tell what motivates that person. If they accomplish those goals they may claim to have won the game. A map of locations in Verona is placed on a table in the middle of the participants and tokens representing the characters are placed on it to show where people are. Each participant needs a pen, a tablet of paper, one six-sided die and five tokens to use to \u201cbuy\u201d the right to make things happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe facilitator tells the participants to move their character anywhere on the map to set up possible scenes. The facilitator points out that this action is what authors think of before writing a scene. The facilitator then picks a participant to start the action by saying \u201cPay a toke for the right to make something happen. Pick one of the scenes. If you could make anything happen here, what would you want to have happen first?\u201d The participant\u2019s answer is the first action of the game. The facilitator sets what the participant has to roll on a six-sided die for this to happen but first asks the students what they think. This puts the burden of thought on the participants and can spur discussion. The participant then rolls and if they roll well the action happens. The facilitator asks the students to each write down a summary of what just happened. The next turn starts with another move followed by an action from another participant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter each participant has had a chance to make one action the facilitator says \u201cFor the rest of the game you may pay a token and offer a counter-argument to any action. I will set the \u201cto happen\u201d roll and we will settle it with a dice-rolling contest.\u201d The facilitator may demonstrate this by making a counter-argument to the next action made. Then they encourage players to disagree. When counter-arguments are made the facilitator decides what has to be rolled for each action to happen. The participants roll for their own actions. If they roll well they get to roll again. If they roll out they drop out of the contest. Rolling continues till only one action is left. If all of them roll out the facilitator may say nothing happened and move on to the next participant or start the contest over again until one of the actions happens. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt every step the facilitator may ask \u201cWhy did that happen? Did that make sense?\u201d and bring in the whole class in the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story will not be completed in a single play session. It will take three or four sessions to do. If participants have two hours they can complete a story. Each participant should be given ten coins. The coins time limit the game and help focus player on the most important events.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the debriefing period the students share their written summaries of the events. They will see how different they are. Perspective is very important in interpreting events. The facilitator asks the students \u201cDid the story we made up today make sense?\u201d Have people make arguments pro and con on this point. \u201cWhat did it feel like to make things up?\u201d Have participants share their experiences. Was it exhilarating? Terrifying? Embarrassing? \u201cCould you do this on your own?\u201d The facilitator here encourages them that they could. The session ends with a home work assignment to write a one page alternate version of the famous balcony scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222648/#Comment_222648" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T05:25:54+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  5:25AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PARTICIPANT\u2019S GUIDE<br/>\n<br/>\nThe participant champions a character in the story. Their task is to advance their character\u2019s goals. They are not limited to saying what their character does. Actions will seldom be about the nurse. Participants may say what any character does. <br/>\n<br/>\nParticipants are given five tokens to buy the right to make actions up. This helps participants feel less resistance to making up events. Tokens also show participants how few actions they can make so they best use them well. When the tokens run out the game is over. <br/>\n<br/>\nParticipants are encouraged to make up actions by the facilitator. Verbal taunts or put downs are not allowed. One purpose of the exercise is to help participants over come embarrassment and shyness so they can better express themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the play session observer students may jump in with ideas of their own. This is to be encouraged. Each time a participant or observed speaks empowers their voice and increases the likelihood they will become more active writers. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring play, participants move character tokens, make up actions, make counter-arguments to other participant\u2019s actions and roll dice. In debriefing they answer the facilitator\u2019s questions and tell the class their personal experiences. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe home work assignment provides the participants the opportunity to try out their new skills and provide facilitators a concrete measurable post test of demonstrated ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nTABLES<br/>\n<br/>\nTO HAPPEN TABLE: The participant rolls one six-sided die for their own action. If they roll any of the target numbers the action happens and is written down by all the participants. Other numbers cause the action to fail. In counter-arguments participants keep on rolling for their own action until one is left or all roll out. <br/>\n<br/>\nCAN\u2019T MISS\t\t\tRoll 6 \u2013 1\u2019s in a row to fail to happen<br/>\nREALLY LIKELY\t\tRoll 2 to 6 for it to happen<br/>\nPRETTY LIKELY\t\tRoll 3 to 6 for it to happen<br/>\nOKAY\t\t\t\tRoll 4 to 6 for it to happen<br/>\nPRETTY UNLIKELY\tRoll 5 or 6 for it to happen<br/>\nREALLY UNLIKELY\tRoll 6 for it to happen<br/>\nIMPOSSIBLE\t\t\tRoll 6 \u2013 6\u2019s in a row to happen<br/>\n<br/>\nCONCLUSION<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial Matrix Games work well to inspire creativity in participants. In a recent play test the audience members were as active as the players. The story reminded people of popular songs, the musical \u201cWest Side Story\u201d and even Shakespeare\u2019s play. People called out suggestions and engaged in friendly competition over what would happen in the story. Everyone came away from the game talking, which is all one can ask from an education game. This is not surprising, Social Matrix Games have been used for over twenty years in education, psychotherapy, organizational planning and as hobby games. A sister game of this (\u201cMATREX: or Doctor Phil with Guns\u201d) is being used to teach English language skills in the French Army. The Social Matrix Game is a simple, low tech, easy to teach, low cost game engine that provides useful exploration of a myriad of highly changeable situations. Please experiment with it in your field of study.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222656/#Comment_222656" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T06:28:28+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  6:28AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad Jiituomas backs me up on Caillois (admittedly a tangential point). What I want to say about Caillois is this: if you look at his typology of play (agon, alea, mimicry, and ilinx) there is a temptation to try to map it onto GNS. "Agon" (competition) is Gamism, "mimicry" (imitative play) is Simulationism--so far so good. But neither of the remaining two aspects of play has anything to do with story, or narrative. However, once you recognize that play has a symbolic dimension, you're halfway to a theory of play-as-narrative (which admittedly may not be the same thing as narrative-as-play). <br/><br/>I was thinking about making a connection to Goffman, too, since his notion of the social encounter as dramaturgical seems to make it simultaneously game-like and narrativistic: we play at the stories of our lives. Role-playing can thus be conceived of as a kind of social encounter in which the dramaturgical is highlighted to the point of self-consciousness: a complex speech genre a la Mikhail Bakhtin.<br/><br/>But that's not a particularly psychotherapeutic perspective on narrative play, I suspect. <br/><br/>Julian,  you don't want to do exactly the thing I was hoping you'd be able to. In other words, while it's clear you have artistic reasons for designing <i>Story Jam</i> in a particular way, I wanted you you to articulate the theoretical rationale of the design (rooted perhaps in the paradigmatic underpinnings of narrative psychology). I don't know whether you need such a rationale to publish, but I expect that ultimately some referee is going to want some justification that connects Story Jam to the theory of the person (the "ecology of mind" perhaps) that informs your disciplinary perspective. But it sounds like narrative psychology is fairly positivistic, as ironic as that seems to me, so you're probably right. Certainly you could say to a reviewer that Story Jam is designed according to artistic principles consonant with the "best practices" of the story-gaming community, exactly to make the point that game design is non-scientific.<br/><br/>Of course, I'd argue that game design is social theory in action. I'm still trying to work out the implications of that, but that's where I'm at.<br/><br/>I'm interested in the specifics of Story Jam as a system; can you talk about that more?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222657/#Comment_222657" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T06:30:46+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  6:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris -- Is that under review at S&amp;G, in print, or somewhere in between? -- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222660/#Comment_222660" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T06:53:46+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  6:53AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's under review - but the last time I submitted something to them they didn't get back to me for a year and a half.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not an academic and don't know the magic words you have to use to get published so I expect to get ignored.

My bias: I'm a parent, and I like to expose my boy (8) to things like the games we play, and am hoping that the violence is actually doing him some good.<br/><br/>Mike</blockquote>\n<br/>Mike,<br/><br/>I do think that Bateson's idea that play symbols are two levels removed from reality is right on. The idea, of course, is that even simple symbols themselves are one level removed, and that using "mock symbols" in play removes them another level.<br/><br/>Trying to tie that idea to the question of fictional violence and darker themes is not as self-explanatory. Humans, of course, can be profoundly impacted by symbols. Lovecraft crafted the metaphor well: to open the book <i>can</i> shatter the mind. Of course, it can also strengthen it and lead to strength and adjustment.<br/><br/>I, also, wonder about this. The problem with contemporary research on the negative effects of media violence is that they usually aren't properly controlled and are almost never very self-critical. Now, certain kinds of exposure to media violence will clearly have effects on children. More to the point, extended TV-viewing (regardless of content, this passive and non-social medium is no good for the mind) and the absence of social interactions with loving caregivers absolutely has demonstrated strong negative effects.<br/><br/>I think I share your bias towards <i>scaffolding the exploration of the darker corners</i> for the young. However, I can't back this up by research, because that research hasn't been done yet. It seems a natural direction for me to go towards in eight or ten years, if it still hasn't been done.<br/><br/>Very cool question.<br/><br/>EDIT: Tangentially, this is something that's very important to me personally. I fought with and eventually vanquished my own set of monsters as a young'un in a very difficult home environment, and that was profound for my development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222698/#Comment_222698" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T09:23:55+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  9:23AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Thanks, Julian, that's fascinating stuff.<br/><br/>What are the tests you're using: on divergent thinking and so forth?

We will be using a divergent thinking task from Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking developed at the University of Oregon\u2019s Imagination Lab. In it, participants were asked certain \u201cWhat if?\u201d questions and given five minutes to write open-ended answers. For example, participants were asked, \u201cHow would the world be different if people had tails?\u201d These writing samples were rated for divergent thinking. No divergent thinking task yet created has been able to measure the whole of the construct in a way that was satisfactorily valid and inter-test reliable, so we chose this task because it seemed to capture a species of verbal or narrative divergent thinking.<br/><br/>IRI. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is an established 28-item self-report questionnaire measuring empathy multi-dimensionally (Davis, 1980). It has also been used to measure an individual\u2019s predilection for narrative transportation, or the likelihood that an individual becomes personally involved in narratives (Mar et al, 2006). It was administered once before the intervention began, once at week 6, and once at follow-up (week 12).<br/><br/>Perceived Stress. The Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS; Cohen, 1988), another self-report questionnaire, is an established measure of how stressful an individual thinks their own life events have been over the prior week. It was administered once before the intervention began, once at week 6, and once at follow-up (week 12). <br/><br/>PANAS. The Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegan, 1988) were utilized to assess changes in positive and negative affect. This was administered once a week over the course of the program at follow-up (week 12), along with the program satisfaction questionnaire. <br/><br/>A-DES. The Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale (Armstrong et al, 1997) is an established questionnaire measure for pathological dissociation in adolescence.

She called her home the Icelandic village of Shreksbach, and she could not remember her mother\u2019s face. Her uncle\u2019s, however, was vivid in her mind, for he bossed her everyday and made her do chores.</i><br/><br/>Narrate the Explosion. The Explosion is the event that propels the Spotlight into the center of the scene. It forces characters to address the Spotlight theme immediately and directly. <br/><br/><i>One day, her uncle spoke to her at breakfast. He said, \u201cMadeleine, you are a becoming a woman. As a woman, you will have new responsibilities. You may no longer play in the dirt, nor with your dolls, for soon we will invite suitors to come and take you for a wife.\u201d</i><br/><br/>Once the Explosion is narrated, if not organically before, the scene becomes the dominion of group consensus and is no longer ruled by a single player.<br/><i><br/>\u201cThat night, as Madeleine lay abed, she heard the faint sound of little claws scratching at the thatched roof.\u201d<br/>\u201c \u2018Oh, she\u2019s in for it now!\u2019 a faint squeak of a voice carried through the room\u2019s one window. \u2018But what will she do?\u2019\u201d<br/>\u201c \u2018She sure could use our help,\u2019 observed another, \u2018but what has she ever done for us?\u2019\u201d<br/>\u201c \u2018 Nothing, nothing,\u2019 agreed the first. \u2018On the other hand, she does have such pretty hair.\u2019\u201d</i><br/><br/>Narrate the resolution. This resolves the Spotlight raised by the Explosion, if only partially or temporarily. Once the Spotlight achieves this resolution, it is time to bring the scene to a close.<br/><br/><i>\u201cMadeleine glanced once over her shoulder as she stumbled away from the farm house. It was totally dark out; even the moon hid behind the clouds.\u201d<br/>\u201cYes, and as Madeleine ran up the dirt path further away from the village, she stumbled in the pitch blackness. Her knees scraped on pebbles, and she began to cry.\u201d<br/>\u201c \u2018Poor little rat,\u2019 Madeleine heard, \u2018Such funny wings, she cannot fly.\u2019\u201d<br/>\u201c \u2018And what strange ears she has,\u2019 a second commented. \u2018She cannot find her way.\u2019\u201d<br/>\u201c \u2018But such pretty hair,\u2019 and Madeleine felt thin, sharp claws catch a few strands of her black hair and begin to tug. They pulled her to her feet by those few strands, and she followed them, stumbling over the earth and loam. She did not know where she was until, just as the bats stilled and fluttered away, the faintest of moonlight emerged from behind the clouds. There, ahead of her, she saw it.<br/>\u201cYes, she saw the blackness of the old belfry, up on the hill. Picking her way to the rotting wooden doors, she stole inside.<br/>" ' I will dwell here,' said Madeleine, 'And belong to no one but myself.'<br/>" And so she did. Cut scene."</i><br/><br/>Move the focus to another player and repeat.<br/><br/>Once you and you\u2019re crew is comfortable with how Themes and Scenes work, you\u2019re prepared to try jamming your first story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222720/#Comment_222720" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T10:29:06+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 10:29AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Julian, what about generalizability?
