It was an interesting process trying to design a game in 24 hours. I will also be submitting it for the Solo Game Challenge. I realize now that I have had some sleep that it seems to have a good foundation, but it is really a mess. I am working on cleaning it up now, but that is not wihat I am actually here to talk about.<br/><br/>This game will be run on random encounter tables. During the initial 24 hours of design I was running low on creativity and put off filling in some of the tables. I am now here to invite you all to help me to fill them.<br/><br/>Picture an aging wizard on a flight into darkness from foes that are overpowering, trying to reach the Stone Circle at Graystead to cast a ritual to save the world. What locations do you pass through on your way? Think about locations that would be good for confrontations against opposing Knights, ninja-witches, goblins, and walking nightmares. These should be locations that Frodo and crew could have passed through on their way to Rivendell if they had taken a different route in a different story in a different world. They could be locations that Rand Al'Thor and crew could have passed through on their initial race out of the Two Rivers.<br/><br/>Challenge: post examples of places that could have shown up in your favorite "escape the forces of darkness" chase story in fantasy literature. Something evocative but relatively unconstrained.<br/><br/>Some examples from me:<br/><br/>On the High Road at midnight<br/>The ferry at Hillshire on a foggy morning<br/>A stand of pines on Bedron\u2019s Ridge in a rainstorm<br/>The Cherry Hill Inn, upstairs coridor, just before dawn<br/>Farmer Gable\u2019s Farm, just after supper time<br/>Elderberry Wells, with two gypsey wagons encamped 100 yards away<br/><br/>Thanks in advance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306828/#Comment_306828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T16:08:38+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  4:08PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A shortcut through Chesterridge cemetery...<br/>By the ruined cathedral...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306852/#Comment_306852" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T20:27:27+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  8:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The freezing Shasta River, roaring with the spring melt -- a risky opportunity to elude the pursuit of the foes' dogs / wolves / worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306856/#Comment_306856" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T21:46:41+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  9:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
