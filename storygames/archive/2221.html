                    The Background:<br/><br/>So one of <a href="http://www.imcr.unizh.ch/systembio/shimizu.html" rel="nofollow">my wife's close buddies</a> is a bigwig in the biology/botany field (even got an article published in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/306/5704/2081" rel="nofollow">Science</a>), and told me about how publication tends to work in evolutionary biology.  Namely, you only publish in the two bigs (Nature and Science), not to mention other mags, until you perform experiments and analyses with provable results.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a lot of time and money is put into experiments that end up failing (as in, everyone expected it to work, but it didn't, often because of unexplainable phenomena and new discoveries). However, since journals tend to not accept failed experiments, these experiments didn't get published, causing folks in the industry to repeat these mistakes, or worse not point out interesting unexplainable phenomena.<br/><br/>Now, though, there is a journal for these failed experiments, the "<a href="http://www.jnr-eeb.org/" rel="nofollow">Journal of Negative Results</a>" (another is <a href="http://www.jasnh.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jasnh.com/</a> ). It basically takes experiments that were set up to succeed and failed, or experiments that were meant to prove one thing but ended up proving something else (sometimes its opposite). In any case, it's a cool idea, a place to document and record failed experiments.<br/><br/>====<br/><br/>Having said that, what are your failed experiments, pieces that you gave up and most likely won't return to? (or perhaps early fragments of games that you totally changed since its first incarnation)?  What did you learn from your endeavor?<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>(mine to follow in a sec)                </div>

                            So, this all started because I was going through some piles and piles of paperwork and printouts that accumulated over the past few years: Printouts, tax forms, work documents, etc when I stumbled upon the later incarnation of the game that I gave up on, that I ran for my gaming group probably back in, I dunno, 2002? 2003? <br/><br/>Thanks to my office's "Scan then Send in PDF format to email" Xerox printer, I can share this Grand Mistake with all y'all:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.robo-christ.com/deadgame/superawesome.pdf" rel="nofollow">The PDF is over here.</a> Not rules, just the character sheets.<br/><br/>It was called "Kyuseisha", a post-apoc kung fu game, and it started off as a Sorcerer modification (and may eventually return to being so again).  I used this system to run about 4 sessions, and then never really developed it further.  <br/><br/>The real surprising thing is, looking at the sheets, I seriously can't remember for the life of my how the damned thing worked. Not even the basic roll mechanic - I seem to recall it was dice-pool based, but I can't remember more than that.<br/><br/>Here were some interesting points:<br/><br/>1) A continuation of the theme brought up a while ago by Tony, "What is my character like <i>today</i>?" If you flip to the back of the docs, you can see these small sheets called "Modes".  This was basically my stab at that a few years back. You coul dhave a number of modes up to your "Acuity" score, and what they did was basically formed templates that you lay over your character, to temporarily have them max out certain abilities and reduce others.  <br/><br/>For example, "The Professor" was a scientist and in charge of the Vault's underground water and hydroponic farm resources.  One of his modes was "Sherlock", which boosted all of his notice and intelligence-based rolls for a period of time. The Professor also carried a makeshift halberd, and when that weapon came out he would shift over to Guan Yu mode, and things would go down like Dynasty Warriors (the PS2 game where you control a warring states era chinese general, hacking through armies of mooks).  And when nothing else was going on, he just used the basic character sheet to determine his skill in other areas.  <br/><br/>What I learned from the above game:<br/><br/>1) Mix in all the awesome shit you want (I cobbled together about 6 ideas that were floating around from indie and Japanese games, with no real sense of the goals). But if you don't have a clear idea of what the game is supposed to be about, then you'll have a hard time working on it.<br/><br/>2) One thing I remember well is that there were psychic powers and the like.  I started playtesting before writing down more than 3 or 4 (there were going to be around 20 or so), hoping that the players would just 'wing it' and come up with stuff on the fly.  In a perfect world, that may have worked, but in the real world what I should have done was spent the extra few hours before the first session tossing at least the bare bones of all the powers into a document, and if they didn't work revise them from there.  In other words, don't start playtesting if only half your system is anywhere near ready to go. Hammer out at least the framework of the whole thing, and revise from there.<br/><br/>Anyone else?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Oh god yes. So many failures.<br/><br/>Valence, the sci-fi game I was working on before Sufficiently Advanced, is not a failed experiment, just an unhappily interrupted one. Stupid hard drive crash.<br/><br/>Sapiens, the game of playing Neanderthals during the rise of Cro-Magnons, will never come back in its current format. It needs to be broken down and recreated, at least from a mechanics point of view. I learned from that one that you can't try making a traditional RPG where the environment is a major enemy. The lack of personality and reactivity makes it not worth spending time on.<br/><br/>Starlight, a D&amp;D world where the sun was taken away and the Drow invaded and won, is gone and not coming back. Midnight did it better, and I don't have time to care about writing setting info for yet another game.<br/><br/>Olympus, where you played the children of the Greek gods, will likely never appear again because a: Scion will do it better, and b: Legends Walk already did it better. It was a good proto-game, though, and had a lot of good feel from just the attributes, the system, and Hubris levels.<br/><br/>I briefly considered writing a game based on the Heresy card game (so...pretty...), but never did much with it. Lots of neat stuff, but just didn't grab my interest enough. I still have some cards from it, so maybe some day.<br/><br/>I have many short, failed experiments that I don't remember well, which tells you that anything that doesn't captivate my interest is going nowhere, and I shouldn't bother trying to write it.<br/><br/>My attempt to have a semi-profitable RPG design business is an ongoing, hilariously, pathetically failed experiment, and I've learned that it doesn't matter how well you can write games if you can't market them worth shit.                        </div>

                            Maw of Hell, later renamed something else.<br/><br/>It was a card-based RPG, set in a world like WH40K's Catachan. For those not familiar, a thick jungle world which was teeming with deadly animals and constantly going thruogh this Vietnam-like war.<br/><br/>The players all played squads of soldiers. The cool thing was this "helmet-cam" narration style, where you narrated through the eyes and mind and mouth of a single squad member in each deployment. So you could switch narrators between missions, whether or not you switch characters in your squad.<br/><br/>I thought it was cool.<br/><br/>The production cost for colour cards was phenomenal and mind-blowing, and I couldn't do it for that reason. I also realized that I didn't want to play a tactical gamist RPG. I also learned more about GNS, and realized that the narrativist and gamist goals I had would conflict really heavily.<br/><br/>The cool thing was the factions: The Galactic Empire (name changed for comprehension) had broken apart. Not by regions, but by departments. The army/navy went rogue, the prison system (which was far-stretching and packed) turned into this giant penal-legion army of its own type, the enslaved farmers formed a Coalition of the Lower Classes...<br/><br/>Because the armies weren't fighting over physical borders (they all inhabited the same physical space), they realized they had to fight their war elsewhere, otherwise they might exterminate themselves. Fighting quickly shifted to this basically uninhabited jungle planet.<br/><br/>It was a cool idea, even if it didn't 100% make sense.                        </div>

                            Let's see...<br/><br/>A Fudge-based "universal anime RPG" called Chocola Anime (get it?) that mostly failed to do anything that BESM hadn't already done and OAV does better. I had a couple other attempts along the way, notably Anime+2d6 (which was very much like Fuzion). A lot of the ideas from it wound up going into a book I wrote for Battlefield Press that hasn't been printed yet.<br/><br/>Eternal Saga, a tabletop RPG based on Japanese-style CRPGs. It's also been done many times over, including the FFRPG and Super Console. Although I kind of like how it was turning out in some ways... I'm not sure it's a game I'd actually enjoy playing.<br/><br/>Aniverse, a crazy anime multiverse setting (originally for BESM) that got into some nutty stuff with narrative causality. If I ever do something with it again, I'll be massively reworking it.<br/><br/>A former friend of mine did a simple computer game, inspired by Legend of the Red Dragon, called Magical Kingdom of Tijuana. I had the idea to do a zany d20 book for it, but it never went anywhere.<br/><br/>Not dead or failed, but very much on the backburner, is "Catgirl: The Storytelling Game," a somewhat tongue-in-cheek WoD style game about catgirls who try to fight evil and avoid being kept as pets.<br/><br/>I have some others (Nekketsu! Battle Stars, Shattered Futures, I Hate You) that haven't gotten started, so I can't say they failed or succeeded yet.                        </div>

                            I'm not anywhere close to game designer, but I like to tinker.  I spent a fair amount of time trying to create a funky hybrid of Nobilis and Wushu, working title "God-Fu".  I discovered a couple of things doing this:<br/>1) Jesus, this is hard work. <br/>2) Riveting interesting ideas together doesn't make a game.  <br/><br/>The project never came to anything, but I have a lot of respect for designers now.                        </div>

It was supposed to be a sort of generic dramatic action movie/TV RPG.  I finished it, posted it, then eventually discovered Primetime Adventures. <br/><br/><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~archer7/special.html" rel="nofollow">Special</a>.  I was trying for a paranoid sort of Firestarter/Scanners vibe with this one.  Regular people with weird powers, and wanted to ask the question: what would you do with this kind of power?  I liked this one too.  Very open ended power design, as in come up with whatever you want.  I wanted to see players do anything from "Yay, I can fly!" to "Wow, I can kill people with a glance."  (Updated as of today:  <i>Heroes</i> the TV show went where I wanted to go with this.)                        </div>

That sounds dope. Bringing more and better physicality to the table has been an obsession of mine ever since I played Dread (the one that uses the Jenga tower). Send me something and I will playtest it. I have so many gaming groups and players, I keep trying to give them away! Games where we can read the rules and play in the same session are preferred. I'm working on a Wrestling RPG that's all about throwing dice at other players :-)                        </div>

                            I'm pretty new to the whole design-a-game thing.  In my youth, I did the usual Heartbreakers-- even a couple of obscure ones (Cyborg Commando, anyone?)  I've got a failed result to add:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Politico</span>:  This was a satirical, very gamey take at politics.  I thought it had a good Corruption (buying votes at home) versus Idealism (buying votes in Congress) mechanic.

The Morningstar Principle.<br/><br/>I've got a couple. <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/work.php?work_id=276" rel="nofollow">Agonistes</a> was my first attempt at an RPG, and billed itself as "A free, diceless, character-centred, generic and universal roleplaying system". It had no randomizers at all and hence was heavily duct-taped together with GM fiat. I think the bolt-on magic system is probably salvagable.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/work.php?work_id=289" rel="nofollow">Rule of Three</a>, on the other hand, has dice, but each die roll is against a number made up of three elements rated either 1 or 2. These can be skills, equipment, training, "drivers", relationships, background, attributes, insights or knowledge, as interrelated on a diagram. It may have seeds of goodness that I'll reuse in the future; again, the bolt-ons (a situation generator and some advice on plot shaping) are most likely to be recycled.<br/><br/>One thing I learned from these was that ignoring the state of the art and building something completely innovative isn't necessarily the best way to go, especially for a beginner. I think <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Errantry.pdf" rel="nofollow">Errantry</a>, which is built on Clinton's Solar System with relatively minor but important modifications, is much more likely to work than anything else I've done.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Well, the first game I ever played was a freeform thingy I thought up. I hadn't played any RPG before that, but had heard of D&amp;D. It quickly degenerated into a Mexican standoff. So, from that point forward, i have always believed in a certain requirement for structure or rules.<br/>
  The second game I made was a space game. Basic D&amp;D was my only real experience. It was fun to play, but nothing innovative 4d6 instead of 1d20, wowy, lol This taught me that being not-too-original can still be fun.<br/>
  Then I got to play Top Secret and TSR Conan (the 1985 version) and it opened my eyes to other design ideas. I made a new space game, but it was moderately math intensive. Probably along the same lines as Champions complexity-wise. This taught me to settle down and make a game that it more easily playable.<br/>
  Even today, I still struggle to scale the math back. It comes so easy to me, but it is not necessarily fun...<br/>

                            I forgot about The Flower of Growth, which was to be an epic Indian RPG using an eponymous graphical character development system. It looked quite pretty, I'll have you know. However, it really wasn't anything you couldn't do with just plain numbers and maybe a little math. The lesson I got here was not to use pictures for character description unless they did something a whole lot better, faster, or simpler than mathematics. Also that I needed to read the Mahabharata, which I've been doing.                        </div>

                            Jason, I feel like the quantity and quality of the wreckage IS a kind of benchmark, as long as it ultimately shows up in play, whether as part of a full-functioning game, as part of a playtest, or simply informing the play of a single player.  This is true whether the play is that of the designer who originally worked on that project or someone else who's familiar with the wreckage.  Other people's wreckage informs my design and play all the time, which makes me feel these projects are never truly lost.  I think Seth Ben-Era's <i>Legends of Alyria</i> is probably the best example here.  The game was in various stages of wreckage until Seth finally published it, but that didn't stop it from being hugely influencial to a generation of players and designers.<br/><br/>Edit: Well, it sorta depends on how you define "wreckage" and "failed experiments" as to whether you include stuff like Alyria.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I guess I was thinking of different folks I know who produce different trails of abandoned stuff in their wake - some have a ton of little scattered ideas and others have pretty solid designlets, but in the end they both produce fun, playable games through divergent processes.  You can't judge one process as superior to another any more than you can declare watercolor superior to oil.  The experience of playing the finished product is the important part to me.  I agree that failed experiments are good, particularly if you can pick at the bones or offer them up for others to use.  Everything you abandon informs the thing you don't.                        </div>

                            Hi Jonathan I just saw this on the web
<blockquote>M. Night Shyamalan has signed on to write, direct and produce the live-action adventure, Avatar: The Last Airbender for Paramount Pictures, MTV Films and Nick Movies.<br/><br/>Nick wants to turn the film into a three-picture series with Shyamalan's continuing involvement. The film marks the first time Shyamalan will direct material he didn't create; the Nickelodeon series is from Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. </blockquote>

On the other hand, it might rock: This first trilogy might blow people away and have them talking for years... and all his subsequent following media-trilogy-movies after avatar will suck/flop/other. ;-)<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>(I just watched Lady in the Water the other day while working.

                            Hah, I still have Heresy cards floating around. I never actually played the game, I just picked up a TON of these cards from the bargain bin of area LGSes, and took them with me to Japan in 1997 to give to area children as presents so they would stop sticking their fingers into my butt.<br/><br/>Interesting premise, kinda like a big helpin' of RIFTS Stew.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I have a laundry list.  Some that failed on theri own lack of merit and some that failed due to my own lack of patience and attemtion.<br/><br/>Beyond Reality was my generic task resolution system.  it was cool and had some neat stuff in it but after a while I said to myself "it is hubris to think that someone might prefer my game to others mechanically.  It's when I shifted gears to my next project.<br/><br/>It didn't have a name but was basically a computer compilation of systems that allowed the group to go through all the possible generic resolution mechanics and made sense of them.  A sort of Choose Your Own System cafateria.<br/><br/>I had a game called Primal Dawn that was about the rise of sentient (and somewhat anthropomorphized) dinosaurs.  I used the aborigines as the human race.<br/><br/>I ran a supernatural cyberpunk game in a fantasy work ala Dark City called Terminus.  It was a LARP that ran for over a year.  I can't say it was a failure but it didn't go anywhere after that.<br/><br/>I crashed in a big Burning Wheel setting project.  I just couldn't pump out the material that I needed to.  The setting was a Persian/Arabic fantasy world all about colonization conflicts and religious exploration.<br/><br/>Recently one failed experiment was a game about post modern psionicists in post-coup Singapore.  Thailand was the setting for my transient reality benders with a Neverwhere feel.<br/><br/>*Sigh*<br/><br/>And this was the highlights <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>
