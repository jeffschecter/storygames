I had seven players, again! It was really fun, and I learned a lot. I mean, a lot. Thanks so much to Micah Olsen, John Aegard, Jake Richmond, Nick Smith, Hans Andersen (the fifth), Wilson Zorn and Kingston Cassidy for showing me how awesome my game could be!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the session, we decided to play Olympians living in 1950s California. We had some awesome characters, like the philandering drunkard patriarch Walter, the manipulative and maniacal matriarch Harriet, the beloved bastard son Carl, the proto-goth daughter Delilah, the son James dating a girl from the Mayan pantheon, the oddball Uncle Dave, Uncle Berry who is pining for his brother's wife, and the hard-working and over-achieving arsehole Paul.<br/><br/>As usual, the players took to the mechanics like ducks to water. Its just so damn natural to dish out pain and intimacy cards, and there's something wonderfully visceral about chucking a playing card at someone. Kingston rightly noted that the text should emphasize this point.<br/><br/>At the very beginning of the session, I framed a scene where everybody was present at the funeral of Carl's mother. There was the usual bickering and fun nastiness, but almost immediately two things became clear: the first being that forcing players to start off with estranged characters who come together in the first scene is restrictive and contrived. Its a good suggestion which works if everyone is stoked on it, but if nobody cares about the funeral of dear old Granny then we should just leave it lie.<br/><br/>Secondly, Issues are really important. When I first framed the scene, I didn't make any mention of Issues and the scene floundered, then sunk. Everybody was intrigued by the initial mean/nice resources, but nobody really found any reason to care. As the scene went on to the end, I watched people's faces. Everybody was going oh my god, this guy doesn't know what he's doing, this game is crap, why the fuck did I sign up to this game? Everyone else is having fun! I could feel the game bombing.<br/><br/>So after the scene ended, I stopped everyone and explained that there are these things called Issues, and everyone should write down something about a character or a relationship that is problematic within the family and that they are interested in. We got some issues like \xe2\u20ac\u0153Will Berry get over Harriet?\xe2\u20ac\x9d, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Will Harriet and Walter's marriage dissolve?\xe2\u20ac\x9d and \xe2\u20ac\u0153Will the family break up Jason's relationship with his girlfriend?\xe2\u20ac\x9d When players framed a scene, I made them say \xe2\u20ac\u0153I'm really interested in this Issue, so I'm going to frame a scene where..\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>Finally, I explained that Issues are important because you cannot have direct conflicts within regular scenes. Covert attacks and jibes may be made, but whenever characters come into direct conflict, they must both back down. As shaky as the foundations of the family may be, they're still family, and still interested in maintaining at least the appearance of decorum. The only way you can resolve Issues is by  charging them up with Pain and Intimacy, which will inevitably lead to a Threshold Scene and a big emotional blowout with huge consequences.<br/><br/>The difference between how the game played in the next scene was like black and white. It was a complete 180 degree shift in awesome. Towards awesome.<br/><br/>I'll let the other players pitch in with their favourite scenes and moments, but one of the high points for me was when Jake threw out a fistful of black cards at every single player at the table, shouting \xe2\u20ac\u0153This is everyone's fault but mine!\xe2\u20ac\x9d after he crashed the car (to the Greekmobile!) while turning around to shout at Harriet in the back seat. And at the climax, there was a supernatural confrontation between Walter and Harriet, where Harriet revealed that she had transformed all of his ex lovers into animals! Enraged, the menagerie tore the house in two! That made my jaw drop. Holy metaphor batman!<br/><br/>During the end of session discussion, we described Kin as the anti Dogs. Instead of driving issues constantly towards conflict and escalation, you want to let things sit and fester for a while. The game is all about what would happen if the Dogs hadn't arrived. This pleases me.<br/><br/>The game really rewards a character that attracts attention. Being loud, bombastic, controversial, incredibly kind, or even just a bit of a dick will give you a hell of a lot of screen time, and a hell of a lot of resources for upcoming Threshold scenes. This also pleases me.<br/><br/>I'm considering a mechanic where each player writes down a secret. It could be big or small, but a secret. These are all put in a hat, and drawn out at random. This is something that your character knows about the character of the player opposite you, but nobody else does. Every time you reference this secret in play without revealing it, you get to draw another card to your hand. When you finally reveal the secret, you can enact an immediate five scene Consequence.<br/><br/>Finally, the players all suggested a montage scene at the very beginning of the game to introduce the mechanics, introduce the characters and their associated Issues. I have no idea how I'd implement that yet, but I think its a bloody fantastic idea.<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun playing with you all. I hope you guys had as much fun as I did!<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>- Kirk                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77994/#Comment_77994" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T02:24:12+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  2:24AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds crazy awesome, man.

I think we just jumped into the scene and after a few minutes we all realized that we weren't sure where to go next. This was as much because it was the first scene with a group of players and characters that were new to us as anything.

I played in some excellent games this weekend, including Joe's second session of Perfect, and the grand-finale T&amp;T trollgasm... but Kin is the game I found myself gushing about when I got back to work on Monday.  It was so freaking awesome that I'll forgive the fact that you just misspelled my name.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome thoughts, in no particular order:<br/>\n- That first scene wasn't so bad as you thought, and it was kind of valuable for setting tone before launching in to the real issues; something like a Dogs' Initiation.  Really, the Red/Yellow/Green Influence lines on the R-Map were what fuelled them.  If you continue to enshrine the Opening Scene in the rules, consider dealing out fewer cards to the players just so it wraps up more quickly.<br/>\n- Do you really need a formal Secrets mechanic?  I saw plenty of nasty secrets introduced during play, almost always by the players whose characters were *not* present during the scene.  In fact, that could be the primary responsibility of the bystanders - introduce things like "Jason's girlfriend isn't just from another pantheon, she's a baby-eating Mayan goddess", "... and she's been having morning sickness."  Or the "Creepy uncle might be siphoning money out of the family fortune."  Having these come up in play creatively kept me on my toes the whole time.<br/>\n- There were eight people at that table, and at any given time pretty much all of them were either slinging cards around and yelling, or at least grinning and hooting and cheering.  Eight people!  The card-based freeform really lets everyone contribute equally to every scene, with little to no downtime for anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't wait to see the next draft.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Hans                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78180/#Comment_78180" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T13:25:28+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  1:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kin is one of the two games I was really bummed about not being able to play at the con.

The play group was fantastic, and I think Kirk's really onto something here with the rules set he's developing.<br/><br/>Here's my own thoughts, again, in no order:\n<ul>\n<li>It's very very natural to look at your hand and see it in terms of mean and nice.  The basic unit of narration, one card = say one "nice thing" or say one "mean thing," feels really easy to me, even though I occasionally had to kinda back up and think about where the cards I was throwing were landing.  People were patient with me as I puzzled this out, thanks guys!<br/></li><li>It was neat to see how the game gestalted around certain outcomes.  The table clearly wanted Walter and Harriet to split explosively.  The Harriet/Barry issue was much more cloudy and non-definitive, though, and was probably going to drag on for awhile.<br/></li><li>The consequences for threshold scenes were elegantly determined.  Once the mechanic of one card = one scene's duration of consequences was explained, we generated some pretty cool stuff.<br/></li><li>Yeah, Kingston and Jake dominated the game, but I never ever felt excluded.  (I was Uncle Barry, for those who don't remember.)  When I wasn't in a scene, I was able to toss in bits of narration; when I wasn't narrating or scene-ing, I was happy to be in audience mode and thinking about my next scene frame.  It would be an interesting experiment to vary the number of cards dealt out to people who are in the scene vs. people who are not in the scene.  What if you dealt no cards out to the people in the scene and left it to the NIS folks to play the cards?   That would solidify the game role of the NIS people.    Note that I'm not really desperate to monkey with these mechanics, which have a lot going for them; I'm just ruminatin'.<br/></li><li>Fan mail!  I got a few cards' worth of it and it was awesome.

Basically, when you're framing (or framed into) a scene, you work how many of your connections are in a scene, and if you have a Giver in the scene, draw a number of red cards to your pool equal to the value of the connection. Same for Taker, only with black cards. Ghosts, you shuffle the deck and draw a number of cards directly to your hand. They're great when you've got a more flexible schedule, but not so great for con games.<br/><br/>I've got some more thoughts on how to bring the relationship map into the game further, mechanically. That is, of course, provided that you guys don't decide that the game doesn't do it already. ;-)<br/><br/>- Kirk                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
