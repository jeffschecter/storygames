He does it with his usual clarity and precision. Time slows down, a description flows out. The text shapes itself into a sober catalog as if an estate inventory. The room has a closet, a chest of drawers, a mirror, an unsprung bed, a small table. The essential furniture, not more. On the wall there\u2019s icon of Mary, rosaries and a coconut stoop for holy water. The top of the chest holds a shell-decorated box, a pairof boots, a balloon, notebooks and paper flowers. The table has a water jug, two combs \u2014 and a blue soap.</p>Flaubert only mentions it once, that soap, and never brings it up again. It\u2019s not used. It\u2019s no Chekhov\u2019s Gun \u2014 Chekhov, Flaubert\u2019s contemporary, said that if an author describes a room and says that there is a gun on the wall, they also need to fire it. Or the gun shouldn\u2019t be there. Everything needs a purpose, everything needs to be incorporated. But the soap, well, Flaubert never fires it. It\u2019s just there.</blockquote><p>And she goes on for the rest of the book how awesome this soap is, this <em>cube de savon bleu dans une assiette \xe9br\xe9ch\xe9e</em>.</p><p>This morning a player in my Tomb of Annihilation game reached third level and decided to pick Arcane Archer for his human PC. I was like that\u2019s awesome. How come your PC learned this elven art? Sounds like there\u2019d be a great story there. And he said an elf had taught him and I rolled up a rando NPC, an elven boy who the PC had met Neverwinter Forest. I rolled randomly that the elven boy was still alive and that the PC was in good standing with him. And I said to write up a bond, duty, responsibility or debt to him.</p><p>And then I thought\u2026 hmm how am I going to use this? How am I going to reincorporate this piece of platform building when the PCs are on another continent right now? And he isn\u2019t death curse afflicted because I rolled that he was healthy. Huh\u2026</p><p>and then I thought oh I better dig up some aethestic theory of visibility here. Is there some sort of philosophy where adding detail in order to provide background, character, a sense of place? And I thought of Danius\u2019 book. (McCloud has similar thoughts in chapter four of Making Comics)</p><p>And I was thinking and writing for hours in order to justify not having to reincorporate this PC into the current goings-on of the PC.\u2665</p><p>Aesthetic philosophy &gt; work</p><p>And then I remembered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6d5NvbMvT4" rel="nofollow">Clint\u2019s advice</a>: \u201cuse that energy not to fight on the internet, but to do cool stuff for games\u201d and I guess I flubbed that T_T</p><p>because the chance of all of our work in defining this NPC actually mattering in the game? like <em>maybe</em> five percent.</p><p>but but but it\u2019s a sense of history for the PC!</p><p>I actually do like that.

Building on this reason, you built memories, not facts for the present or the future. Maybe there should be a different interpretation of the table for memories, then. Like what is a debt to the memory of a person ? Maybe before training, the PC salutes an item representing the elven master, maybe when the moon is full, he leaves a fruit and a candle in a makeshift altar. What would matter to me is that those little rituals ensure that naming the elven master was not just handwaving the cause. Like : my PC family died and the mentor with them, how unfortunate this character has no strings whatsoever. Then, if the bountyhunter finds the altar near the campfire, you've got your narrative payoff.<br/><br/>The cause could be named just for the sake of realism, you've totally got the right to dream. This realist technique already has a name : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_reality" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_reality</a> . I have found that I prefer the Effect of World. That's when when the greatest number of facts are incidentally correlated. Like in the bounty hunter example, there's no relation between bounty hunter and elven boy, which makes narrative causality look "non intentional", and yet leaves room for meaning. It is like destiny with sleight of hand. I wish I could formulate this better. Anyway, that's much more "Story" in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473509/#Comment_473509" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T11:31:50+00:00" title="May  8, 2018 11:31AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah that's awesome they can have an item! trinket table here we come!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473514/#Comment_473514" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T12:14:02+00:00" title="May  8, 2018 12:14PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            a carved wooden figurine the size of a small chess piece that looks like the PC's mother would've looked if she had gone to old age, if Venomfang hadn't arrived<br/>the encumbrance is the same as a single coin<br/>on the bottom it says something in elvish followed by this word in common: "Root"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473515/#Comment_473515" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T12:14:57+00:00" title="May  8, 2018 12:14PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            blue soap chipped plate\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473555/#Comment_473555" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T18:14:54+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  6:14PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My story-game instinct would be to leave that elf as placeholder on the character sheet until the party runs into an elven outpost or something, and then reintroduce him.

Your posts always seem to come off as "I discovered this new thing that disproves all the common advice on this sort of thing!" and seem to present in a very one-sided way and that bothers me on some level that I should learn to ignore.<br/><br/>I really DO think that you are rediscovering a lot of stuff though.  The whole reason the "tie it into narrative" movement exists is because people used to create tons and tons of backstory about random NPCs who never meant anything.  Soap. Things got really soapy.<br/><br/>And now you've written a post that says "Actually, soap is better than all that 'narrative tie in' stuff that evolved as a reaction to it."  Maybe that's not how you mean it, but it's right there in the title: Soap is better than guns.  Backstory that does nothing is better than tying stuff into your narrative. <br/><br/>I guess you are just trying to say "Sometimes it's good to not have everything somehow tied into the narrative, it's good color to add details that don't necessarily 'mean' anything." but even that seems very weird because that's arguing in favor of the default.  Everything starts out as just color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473574/#Comment_473574" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T20:36:36+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  8:36PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was being self-deprecating about it "\u2026 I was thinking and writing for hours in order to justify\u2026" but it hurts when you call me flailing around, bland etc.<br/><br/>Danius' book is good and Flaubert's <i>A Simple Heart</i> is good.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>that's arguing in favor of the default</p></div></blockquote>\nA lot of things that are obvious to one person can be something that's useful to someone else.

Maybe it's hypothetically possible to have a game where literally everything reincorporates, but I am skeptical -- the way every game I've ever played in this style goes, especially early on, you are just making stuff up and choosing what to bring back in.  You almost necessarily generate way more stuff than you can possibly reincorporate.  There's just too much to make sure that every NPC you introduce somehow becomes important to the plot.  So the ones that don't... become color. Or rather, STAY color.  Everything is color UNTIL you make an effort to make it NOT color.  That's what I mean by "it's the default".  I don't mean this as some sort of playstyle statement, I mean, literally, at the instant something is created, it defaults to being "just color" -- it adds nuance or flavor to something, but it has no ties to anything else unless you exert further effort to make them.  All pottery starts out as a lump of clay, and all NPCs start out as "soap" and you need to put in more effort to make them more than that.  And you don't always have to.  In fact, there isn't enough time in the world to make all the clay into pots.  <br/><br/>So it feels strange to read something that sounds like it is saying "Guys! Let me talk about how great it is to not make pots!"                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473577/#Comment_473577" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T20:57:43+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  8:57PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2018 8:57PM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for apologizing, Airk.

And Chekov's gun has a lot to do with that context.<br/>And with Chekov also working in short stories, there's the fact that a short story doesn't have nearly the amount of space that the average campaign has, so short stories need to be really careful about what they do and don't detail, because you've maybe got 50 pages to work with, but are more often working with 10-30 pages. Whereas like, a ttrpg campaign is more similar in length to a series of long novels, or a television series, where you have much much more space to work with. <br/>And when you get into long-form stuff, you don't have to be nearly as careful with the conservation of detail, because you have as much narrative space as you need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473597/#Comment_473597" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T01:30:58+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  1:30AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, depending on the genre, it seems there has to be some Chekov's gun-not-guns in a story.

And me coming from Hillfolk where there are wants and needs and tears, I was a bit frustrated with that. I thought once we get into the dungeon and the pressure is really on, then we can talk. And/or if we don't have any conflicts there either, then the game would be procedural and that can also be good.<br/><br/>Well, he wanted some more soap to make the game come alive.<br/><br/>Some preemptive clarifications:<br/>\u2022 I didn't want <b>zero</b> non-conflict tavern banter. But he thought twenty minutes was too little.<br/>\u2022 I know the DM and I knew how few sessions this group had to play. I knew that we were looking for a dungeon mcguffin. If this had been a longer campaign, like Emma says, I would've been much more into all sorts of banter and other exploration of this corner of Oerth.<br/>\u2022 In the end, in three sessions and then this group couldn't meet anymore because of other commitments, we got like two rooms in.

Maybe sometimes the gun gets fired in the third act... and maybe, other times, the gun is a symbol of the character's fears, hanging over his head. In a third case, it's just visually reminiscent of the prow of the ship on which he eventually dies.<br/><br/>The soap might not get used, in other words, but perhaps there is a long-running sense of symbolism around cleanliness and dirt in the story, and the soap ties into that.<br/><br/>Frank Herbert created subtle effects just by using the colour yellow selectively in his descriptions, for instance. Lots of different ways to do this!<br/><br/>For reincorporating something like the Elven mentor, you can go similarly metaphorical or indirect - as simple as another important character also having a mentor who is far away, so they can compare their relationships to one another. Or the little carved wooden figurine has nothing to do with where they are, but, look! Here's a culture of forest dwellers who all love carving wooden figurines. There's no literal link or reincorporation here, but a bit of resonance which may affect the players or the audience.<br/><br/>Fun to think about, in any case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473769/#Comment_473769" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T04:19:50+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  4:19AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The soap might not get used, in other words, but perhaps there is a long-running sense of symbolism around cleanliness and dirt in the story, and the soap ties into that.</p></div></blockquote>\nI think it stands in contrast to the theme of simplicity in the story.
