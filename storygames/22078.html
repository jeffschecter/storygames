Or a mixture of the two, like the city of <i>Sanctuary</i>.<br/><br/>Some games are designed to accommodate whole existing settings from other media: I believe <i>Questlandia</i> and <i>Archipelago</i> both explicitly talk about this (and they are both examples of very "storygamey" games).  Narrative-oriented games may often tend toward an arc that suggests closure at the end of a session or series of sessions, but you can always think of a clever way to pick up those characters (or related ones) and continue.  What you end up with tends to be "episodic" (in the TV sense), and "campaigns" are like "seasons," which is pretty cool.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483412/#Comment_483412" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T03:41:22+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  3:41AM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forbidden Lands, by Fria Ligan games, may be very much what you seek, OP. It's not "trad" in any meaningful sense of the word I know: there's a GM, but they are very much bound by the rules, and there is some story-gamey flagging stuff. There's a very definite setting, one that the PCs learn about along with their characters.<br/><br/>It *is* traditional in its content: the PCs are adventurers (not necessarily heroes; the game is sort of... agnostic on that point in a way that reminds me of Apocalypse World*), it's a fantasy game, there are swords and monsters and spells and demons and etc.<br/><br/>Exploration is put front and center with this whole map thing: you put stickers on it to denote areas your PCs have explored, and it sounds like that will really create a living world feel to it. I've even been told that if I run a one-shot or whatever, to just drop the stickers on the map anyway, and then if I get a full campaign going, what happened in the one-shot is still canon. In a sense it lets you create a one-(or more!)-GM, many players kind of living world.<br/><br/>I dropped $100 on the very pretty boxed set and am itching to try it out, which I believe I will be doing soon!<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>My friend <a href="/forums/profile/StoneTharp">@StoneTharp</a> ran Mythras (RuneQuest 6) in what we called a "relationship sandbox" style; the game was also "anthropological roleplaying." There was a somewhat predefined setting, but we deepened the in-game cultures through portraying and exploring them, and while exploring the physical setting mattered (a ton!), there was a reason we called it a relationship sandbox. Navigating through the various lines of family, clan, religion, alliances, etc. was just as important as the physical orienteering through the wilderness. The game rules did somewhat facilitate this, though if you end up going with RQ6 / Mythras I'd recommend talking to me about the house-rules we used...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483432/#Comment_483432" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T11:21:26+00:00" title="May 15, 2019 11:21AM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> He was specifically talking in comparison to PbtA <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p><p>Forbidden Lands (disclaimer I\u2019m friends with several people who work at Fria Ligan):<br/>I\u2019m pretty frustrated with Forbidden Lands so far; I bought two books for it (one book was an anthology of four modules, and one was a campaign) but those modules had stuff like \u201cHere are some suggestions of events to subject the adventurers to\u201d. \u201cSubject to\u201d\u2026?

People do their damnedest to dance around it, but you'll note that those who actually play full-blown sandboxes don't join the chorus.<br/><br/>I will <i>freely</i> admit that many games are not actively opposed to sandboxing, and that some games have some minor sandbox features. However, I feel that calling them sandbox games without qualification is completely disingenious.<br/><br/>However, regarding your next question: the only definition of the idea of story game that is outright antithetical to sandboxing is "drama game" - as in, a game that replicates dramatic storytelling. You probably understand the term in a sense that is much wider than that, though, and in general there is no contradiction: it is very much possible to develop a sandbox for something that you would probably call a story game.<br/><br/>I have some examples of games that are both powerfully sandboxing and probably story games - narrativist games with structural rules, for instance - but none that I can think of have been actually published.<br/><br/>For example, my friend Petteri has this game in development called <i>The Varangian Way</i>. Here is how it fulfills the requirement:<br/><br/><b>Sandbox:</b> The game begins with a player character party of Swedish vikings who explore the Eastern European waterways in hopes of trade and glory. Individual characters are relatively cheap, you are expected to develop a character stable. The party can and will split up, with some starting their own tradeposts alongside important waterways, or seizing thrones among the local peoples, or going back home to claim their birthright in Scandinavia. The game content is tracked on maps the players develop as play progresses; content is pushed by individual players (the game is GM-less) utilizing randomization procedures and arbitrary inspiration. Individual characters and parties are followed in parallel, as players please, as they delve into the landmass and perhaps discover the fabled Constantinople at some point.<br/><br/><b>Story game:</b> The overall goal of the game is to tell compacted slice of life stories about a varied ensemble cast of characters who live and die in the world of Ruthenian waterways, forests and steppe. Much of the lives of the characters is dealt with on a highly abstract level, time passes quickly and whole human lifetimes are potentially in play in terms of dramatic stakes. The core exploration activity in the game reveals a randomized, potentially fantastical and ahistorical Eastern Europe for interaction with civilized Europe; it is essentially a Western genre setup, except in 8th century European east. Furthermore, the heroically decisive actions of the main characters impact the socio-economic development of the entire Ruthenian region in the early medieval period, ultimately determining how state formation and political compromise between the local tribes works to create "a Russia" (in the sense of not necessarily being the Russian world we know).<br/><br/>So yeah, the idea is possible, it's just that I'm not aware of published game products that would really have the rubber hit the road in terms of sandboxing technique meeting story game artistic goals. The very least I'd expect for a game to be called a "sandbox" would be for the players, not the GM, to be in ultimate control of what content gets played and what is left as mere tantalizing potential. Ideally you'll have maps and stuff, too, of course, as part of an expansive world simulation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483462/#Comment_483462" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T16:02:14+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  4:02PM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, also, I just realized that the history of roleplaying actually knows of a few sandbox story games.

I wouldn\u2019t consider AW to be a sandbox game, but some would (many people play with maps and threats placed on the map, which the players can interact with however they like; they see the Fronts/Threats as enabling sandboxing). (I could write about why I don\u2019t consider AW to work in this fashion, but that\u2019s probably best left to another conversation - one aspect, though, is what Sandra said: the prep is not rigorous enough and impartial adjudication is very very difficult, at best.)<br/><br/>Similarly, Mutant Year Zero appears to be fairly clearly a sandbox game, but is it a story game? It\u2019s somewhere in the middle ground. So it depends on your criteria.<br/><br/>In theory, I see no reason why a story gam couldn\u2019t be a sandbox game. It just looks like no one\u2019s really done that, at least not a rigorous fashion.<br/><br/>The implied question is: what does adding sandbox features to a story game add to the game? How does it improve things? <br/><br/>It looks like, so far, designers haven\u2019t thought of any interesting answers to that question.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483474/#Comment_483474" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T18:06:34+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  6:06PM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2019 5:21PM by Rickard.">edited May 17</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Sandbox as an amusement park</b><br/><a href="http://www.lamemage.com/" rel="nofollow">Ben Robbins' games</a><br/><a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/a-thousand-years-under-the-sun/" rel="nofollow">A Thousand Years Under the Sun</a><br/><a href="https://semielgames.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/the-coyotes-of-chicago-playtest-document/" rel="nofollow">The Coyotes of Chicago</a><br/><br/><b>Sandbox as a relationship map</b> (fish tank)<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17821/svart-av-kval-vit-av-lust-i-will-answer-any-questions" rel="nofollow">Svart av kval, vit av lust</a><br/><a href="https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10742.phtml" rel="nofollow">Dogs in the Vineyard</a><br/><a href="https://www.urverkspel.com/vara-spel/oevriga-projekt" rel="nofollow">The Murder of Mr. Crow</a><br/>Unknown Armies (if story game)<br/><a href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#the-dynamic-pickup-game-set-em-up-and-knock-em-down" rel="nofollow">Spirit of the Century</a> (if story game)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483475/#Comment_483475" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T18:09:08+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  6:09PM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2019 6:16PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited May 15</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm hoping to fashion <a href="http://wondrousadventure.com/warg" rel="nofollow">WARG </a>into a D20+PbtA+The-West-Marches game.

I think Sandbox to me means a world players can explore. It shouldn't be made up on the spot, or at least not entirely. (I think there is room here for improvisation within the framework of pre-established material). It should feel like players can go anywhere. To me I was thinking location but I suppose a relationship map works the same.

My experience with it was kinda unusual.<br/>We were playing a D&amp;D/<abbr title="Hillfolk">HF</abbr> mashup for our main campaign and in the same gameworld, Zakhara during the al-Qadim era, I also had a smaller group (subset of main group) playing mamluks going from town to town; this smaller game used DitV. The list of laws&amp;rules in al-Qadim was perfectly usable for DitV and it was a great way to become familiar with aQ better.

There are a lot of rides, and the players can ride whatever seems interesting for them.<br/><br/>However, when I presented the <a href="http://gnomestew.com/game-mastering/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-an-intrigue/" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a>, some people have said "Well, that's just how I do my sandboxes" (not in the Gnome Stew articles though, elsewhere in forums).<br/><br/>I can in some way come to a sense that "the sandbox" is an umbrella term for this type of structure, where you explore certain things. For the amusement park, it's places with everything on it, and for the fish tank, it's the relations between factions that you explore.<br/><br/>Of course, it's possible to combine the fish tank and amusement park; just to confuse things even further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483522/#Comment_483522" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T07:28:44+00:00" title="May 16, 2019  7:28AM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2019 8:51AM by Rickard.">edited May 16</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I do think I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> here though (if I am reading him right) that prep is still prep if its done by everyone.

I've often called the most obvious third way "relationship drama" ("blood opera" is often appropriate, although the term could easily apply to something nonviolent like the Jane Austen game).<br/><br/>There's this Burning Wheel scenario I co-designed a long time ago, that I've run like 15 times. It's a Three Musketeers thing, quite explicitly so, and the entire scenario is really just about the players' alliances and machinations with and against each other, often (but not always!) culminating in a swordfight between half-brothers. It would be impossible to characterize as either a railroad or a sandbox, and *much* of "indie RPGing" is similarly orthogonal to those concerns.<br/><br/>That all said, prep a big enough fishtank, and you could probably sustain a whole campaign in what I think of as "relationship sandbox" style, though IME you can't rely on the GM's prep to supply all the important details. In our Mythras game, for example, the players did do a fair amount of authoring, particularly of cultural details. We could possibly have used random tables for that purpose, but it might have hurt the anthropological feel of the game.<br/><br/>By the way, there's a cool trick from Beyond the Wall that's important to mention here. One of the historical problems in sandbox play is that the players may not be sufficiently invested in the world. (I know that, in theory, in OD&amp;D they're motivated by treasure, but IME that's often not enough, particularly for good roleplayers. Where by "good" I just mean, "able to develop a character's personal complexity.") When the entire world is a blank (to you, the player), it can simply be tough to develop much emotional attachment to all this stuff you're discovering.<br/><br/>In BtW, the players collaboratively add stuff to the map in Session Zero. But, the GM rolls secretly to see how accurate is their information about each location. This introduces some great uncertainty both in- and out-of-character. (The way the knowledge is framed, in-character, makes it clear to the characters as well as the players that it may be unreliable.) Really great way to thread the needle, in my opinion, between making an external, prepped world that feels real, and making sure the players have a sense of ownership of the campaign world.<br/><br/>P.S. Sandra, a player inventing a dragon cult that's chasing them is not violating the Czege Principle! They're not saying what the *outcome* of the conflict is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483533/#Comment_483533" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T15:35:33+00:00" title="May 16, 2019  3:35PM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>In BtW, the players collaboratively add stuff to the map in Session Zero.

There are many individuals, all with different quirks and issues and appealing virtues. You must, in the end, choose whether to be with one of them or to be alone.<br/><br/>How\u2019s that? Is it a sandbox?<br/><br/>What if we also add a variety of locations, which play into the dating scenarios? Would that make it more sandboxy, or is it unnecessary?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483625/#Comment_483625" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-17T17:29:30+00:00" title="May 17, 2019  5:29PM">May 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I just really don\u2019t want people after I\u2019ve died to be like \u201cOh wow we\u2019re playing Once Upon a Time, a typical blorb game just like 2097 intended it!\u201d It\u2019s not.<br/><br/>Part of \u2018explorable\u2019 means discoverable.</p></div></blockquote>\nI honestly don't see the point in differentiating between "An idea I came up with four days ago" and "An idea I came up with just now".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483631/#Comment_483631" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-17T18:06:50+00:00" title="May 17, 2019  6:06PM">May 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me I negate the difference between "an idea I came up with before play" and "an idea I generated randomly".<br/>If you come up with the idea "just now", it is informed by the situation at hand.

It\u2019s not a great situation and it\u2019s a very contrived &amp; exaggerated example. Normally the more information &amp; agency the player has about the various choices the better. If I run a module and I find myself describing a choice between two exact same doors, I think to myself \u201cthis module sucks\u201d. Right now I\u2019m running the Tomb of Annihilation which is, I think, good; the various areas and corridors all have a very clear &amp; different theme making the choices between them be, while sometimes deceptive &amp; devious, at least not non-choices. Whenever there\u2019s a \u201cnon-choice\u201d; like where we are right now in the game there is one area where the players can choose between a 5 foot wide corridor and a 10 foot wide corridor not otherwise distinguished; I know from reading ahead that those corridors will quickly enough distinguish themselves from each other well in time before turning into you having made an inescapable choice.</p><p><small>Also, in Smullyan\u2019s original example (I ran this in our first al-Qadim campaign) there are signs on the door.</small></p><p><small>Above both doors it says \u201cOne of the signs is true, but the other one is false.\u201d</small></p><p><small>One door says \u201cThis door leads to your freedom and the other door leads to a tiger.\u201d<br/>The other door says: \u201cOne of these doors leads to your freedom and one of these doors leads to a tiger.\u201d</small></p><p>The lady and the tiger example is very extreme to make it absolutely clear that we\u2019re talking about:</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>the idea that a GM shouldn\u2019t be switching things up arbitrarily</p></div></blockquote><p>This. When the very basics of blorb are being questioned we need basic &amp; extreme examples so that everyone is on the same page about what blorb is (don\u2019t switch the content behind doors).</p><p>It\u2019s not a dancer\u2019s job to be the theatre floor. Their job is to dance on that floor, to fly over it. Similarly, in blorby play, the player should not be asked to be in the mindset of collaboration. Their job is to explore, experience, make choices in, set their mark on, discover the game world. It\u2019s the DM\u2019s job to be keeper of that game world; keep it honestly, solidly, vividly.</p><p>A drink of cold water in a beautiful tall glass on a hot day isn\u2019t improved by glass fragments being mixed into the water. The glass is doing its job by holding the water. The water is doing its job by not spilling out on the table. The two components are working together but don\u2019t mix. The glass feels cool to the touch and looks beautiful. The water is nice to drink and looks beautiful in a different way.</p><p>Similarly, the alchemy of blorb is the player character dancing on the gloracle, consulting the gloracle. A human referee &amp; DM is a great technique to use for purposes of adjudication and information separation, so that the gloracle, the physics layer, the world layer, can be this beautiful canvas, this wide snowfield where the hobo\u2019s footprints will soon enough be left.</p><p>A good player in a blorby game takes their role as visitor to another world seriously. In this holodeck, or danger room, or Narnia wardrobe, they have one job. It\u2019s a difficult one: To live.</p><p>A good DM in a blorby game respects that role separation.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484317/#Comment_484317" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T13:23:40+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  1:23PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2019 1:30PM by DeReel.">edited May 26</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are no valid arguments.

You do can it with different games or by using the same game. As more of the world gets created through play, more and more will be established. This will give a feeling of playing in a more solid place. (Neutral/objective/hygienic/etc. game mastering does not follow.)<br/><br/>For me, as a player, one benefit of a sandbox is that world feels more solid and it pushes back, sometimes, so that I, as a player, can not simply mold it along my wishes. For me Burning wheel also gives this feeling, when the game master is not too soft about asking dice rolls. The roll difficulties are often quite well defined by the fictional circumstances, which adds to the feeling of a solid world.<br/><br/>But yeah, I think think player commitment to respecting a pre-established world is the key. I would recommend establishing the world through play, rather than by reading about an existing one, but maybe that could work, too. There will be problems if the game gives narrative authority to people who know significantly less about the setting than some others do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484685/#Comment_484685" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T16:57:47+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  4:57PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a pretty good summation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484699/#Comment_484699" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T17:34:47+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  5:34PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally ran Forbidden Lands.
