With the growing excitement in the run-up to GenCon, I could only look on with a certain degree of envy.  At least, until Jason Morningstar's thread on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3799&amp;page=2#Item_2" rel="nofollow">the 15 minute GenCon demo</a>.<br/><br/>These have been amazing.<br/><br/>I've grabbed a number of them, printed them out, and I'm prepping for this Friday, when some friends are heading over.  One of them has no SG experience, so this is to be an introduction to these games.<br/><br/>There's not much of an Indie scene near me at the moment, so this will allow me to test out a bunch of games quickly.  I own a goodly collection of Indie/Story games, but my game time being limited, I can't do everything at once, nor learn every system comprehensively.<br/><br/>A bunch of 15 minute demos will give us all a chance to try a lot out quickly, and should get me the "lightbulb" moment, where I realise <i>how</i> the game does what it does, and where the meat is.<br/><br/>Admittedly, a number of the demos are for games I own (Roach, DRYH, tMW), but a few are going to be new to me (SotC, Best Friends, I'm looking at you).  This is letting me try out games that I've never played before.<br/><br/>Now, when I'm looking to buy rpgs, I'm influenced by a number of factors:<br/>- Actual Play<br/>- Reviews<br/>- Demos<br/><br/>The first two I can can get to easily through this here internet thing.  As for demos?  The above thread gave me access.<br/><br/>"Best Friends" has now made my wishlist, with the demo being the turning point.<br/><br/>We already know that demos can sell games.  I reckon that the demo packs can as well.  Of course, having the game demoed to you personally by the creator is the best case scenario.  However, if these demos were made available elsewhere (forums/websites/etc.), as an intro to the game, I reckon you could generate a number more sales, especially from those who won't be at the various conventions.<br/><br/>From a (potential) customer's standpoint, I can try out some of these games before deciding whether to buy the game.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting creating a rules-lite version, but simply taking the convention demo stuff and making that available to a wider audience.  The "single scene" from these demos is enough.<br/><br/>There is the risk, I guess, that someone running your demo badly could put them off.  However, given the tight focus of the demo, that risk is much reduced.<br/><br/>I know that there are a number of "previews" available, to give us customers a look at the product we're considering buying, but a demo pack is something different: I don't get to look at it, I get to take it for a test drive.<br/><br/>That's got to be worth a shot, right?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90031/#Comment_90031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T05:14:16+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  5:14AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mark,<br/><br/>I think you're right, but with a few caveats.  Those highly refined demos you're talking about are designed to evoke the experience of play without actually, you know, <i>playing</i>.  In the service of that goal they often omit or even bend rules - the Roach demo, for example, doesn't even mention Reputation, which is a key bit of the full-length game.  The Grey Ranks demo leaves out a bunch of stuff - mission leaders, singling people out, choosing situation, etc.  After the demo, if the demo-er is interested, I'll expand a bit on ways the game is richer and more complex, which is something I can do because I know the game well.  So two concerns there - first, that the person running the demo won't actually have answers to those natural questions, and second, that the demo-er may feel misled because of it.  So it's a little tricky.  I'd hate to have someone put off because of a poor demo, you know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90041/#Comment_90041" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T05:31:54+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  5:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Collective Endeavour have put all their 15 minute demos online <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/32" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

I hadn't thought about it as clearly, but there are a lot of shortcuts, rules omissions, etc.  However, as you point out, they evoke the experience of play, rather than playing.  It's a limited experience, but, like previews/trailers, it's an opportunity for potential customers to test something out.  I can see that the wrong person demoing a game could kill it.  I think I need to clarify that I don't think that the "demo packs" should be used for some idiot like me to turn up to a con and demo them away to random strangers.  I mean, unless I own and know the game (and even then...), I'm only going to muck it up, and there's no way I can provide sensible answers to the questions I might be asked.<br/><br/>Instead, rename it the "try before you buy"/"15 minute sample" pack, or what have you.  The intent is to get to the likes of me who didn't bother to meet you at a con to look something over, and maybe try it out with a friend or two prior to one of our regular games.  Think of it as being used in a similar way as preview offerings, rather than for any old idiot to run at conventions.<br/><br/>With regards to your point that the demo-er might feel misled, I'm just looking at your Roach demo script.  In the end paragraph, you mention about reputation, and a (very) quick overview of the full game.  Now, I admit that I own the Roach, so I'm probably not the ideal "first-time" candidate here.  Nevertheless, something like that could be useful in a "sample" pack or the like.<br/><br/>Rereading your post, I reckon it'd make a pretty good caveat to go on the front of any such product.<br/><br/>I guess the real questions are:<br/>(a) Is a sample/"try before you buy" PDF (or the like) useful?<br/>(b) How different from a demo pack is it?<br/>(c) How much work is something like that going to take?<br/>(d) Are the inherant risks worth it?<br/><br/><b>Hi Andrew</b><br/>Thanks for the link.  The sound you just heard was me yoinking downloads to add to my demo collection.  The Most Excellent Graham W had already clued me in to Collective Endeavour, and the goodness that can be found there.  I've signed up, and I'm going to try my damndest to make it to Dragonmeet (assuming that real life lets me).  Give me a while to browse the forums and start fermenting my ideas into some sort of shape.  I might even start posting.<br/><br/>I'm based in Bristol (South West England, to you foreign types), and whilst I know a heavy chunk of local gamers, I've grown to realise that you need to find the right team for whatever game you're lining up.  I know who I want in my proto-indie group, so it's just a case of snagging them up.  That, and then working out the usual scheduling concerns.<br/><br/>This evening, about half of my proto-indie group, the Ur-group, I guess, will turn up and we'll chill out, prod the various Indie games I've got, and we'll probably run through a couple of the demos that have been posted about.  I'm angling for the ones I actually own &amp; have read through first, but we'll see how it goes.  I'm confident that it'll turn out well, especially as there's a number of reliable-fun offerings in easy reach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90062/#Comment_90062" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T06:53:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  6:53AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see the 15 minute demos cut into two pieces, both pieces posted on Youtube.
