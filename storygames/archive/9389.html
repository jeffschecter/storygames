It runs kinda like a card-based, trait-less hack of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, but also has a cool oracle based on the 36 traditional oaths sworn by triad members (frex: Oath <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a> is "I shall never embezzle cash or property from my sworn brothers. If I break this oath I will be killed by myriads of swords.")  You consult the oracle to see how many oaths you've broken and what kind of shit you've gotten yourself into.  That kind of thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, the core mechanic of the game is based on the incredibly addictive Chinese card game Big Two, which I learned when I was over in the mainland for high school between 1998 and 1999.  The game is kinda like Poker + card shedding games (Crazy 8s?) had a sexy, sexy baby of awesome.  But my adaptation of Big Two for the mechanics of the game will only work if I can effectively teach people how to play Big Two.  I know I can do this in person, but I'm less clear about doing it through a text.<br/><br/>So here's what I need: I'm going to post my guidelines for playing Big Two and am looking for feedback, especially from people who are willing to grab a few friends (you can play with 2-5 players, but 4 is best) and try it out.  If you start gambling on Big Two with your buddies and lose all your money, I claim no responsibility!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's how to play Big Two.  Thanks in advance to anyone willing to try it out.  Let me know if there are places where the rules are unclear or where you run into problems.  Or even what strategies you found to be effective, how you ordered the cards in your hand, etc.<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/><b>INTRODUCTION TO BIG TWO</b><br/><br/>The rules of <i>The Last Days of Old Macau</i> are partially derived from the Chinese playing card game Big Two (<i>cho dai di</i>). This game has a variety of names, some of which are more vulgar than others \u2013 in Mandarin, it\u2019s known as <i>da lao er</i>, \u201cBig Penis\u201d \u2013 and while, like Poker, it has never been a table game in major Macanese casinos, Big Two remains wildly popular in the back alleys of Macau and Hong Kong. Although Lee Yih published a commercial variant of Big Two as <i>Gang of Four</i> (Dargaud, 1990; Days of Wonder, 2002), all you need to play the game \u2013 as it\u2019s commonly played in Asia \u2013 is a standard deck of 52 playing cards, jokers removed. Honestly, I like Big Two a lot better than <i>Gang of Four</i>.<br/><br/>There are many variants of Big Two found among Chinese-speaking communities in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, and elsewhere, so the rules presented here should be thought of as a fairly conservative distillation of the core rules, without additions are likely to have begun as \u201chouse rules.\u201d If you sit down to play Big Two with folks who learned the game first-hand, as I originally did, there may be significant differences, especially in the manner in which certain hands may be played. You\u2019re on your own there!<br/><br/>When getting a group together to play <i>The Last Days of Old Macau</i>, I recommend that you start by playing several hands of Big Two over some tea or Chinese beer (Tsingtao \u2013 itself hailing from a former German colony \u2013 is easy enough to find). Once you\u2019re comfortable enough with Big Two that you can play the game semi-effectively while discussing character concepts for <i>The Last Days of Old Macau</i>, you should be ready to go.<br/><br/><b>DEALING</b><br/><br/>Big Two is best played with four players, dealing 13 cards to each one.  <br/><br/>If you are playing with fewer players, deal 13 cards to each player and set aside the rest. If you are playing with more than four players, deal out the deck evenly among the players, discarding whatever cards remain.  For example, if you are playing with five players, deal each player 10 cards and discard the remaining two.  Always remember to re-shuffle the discarded cards back into the deck before dealing the next hand.  Playing with more than five players is not recommended, as the game changes dramatically.<br/><br/><b>PLAYING</b><br/><br/>The player with the 3 of Diamonds, the lowest ranked card in the game, plays first. The first play must include the 3 of Diamonds but can also include other cards as well, as long as a valid combination is played. <br/><br/>Play proceeds counter-clockwise to the next player, who must play a valid combination of higher value than the previous play. Additionally, each subsequent player must play the same number of cards as the first player.  For example, if the first player played a straight \u2013 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \u2013 the next player can play any valid five-card combination with a higher value than that straight. In my experience, players generally place their plays in the center of the table, stacked on top of one another.<br/><br/><b>VALID COMBINATIONS</b><br/><br/>1 Card:   Single Card<br/>2 Cards:  Pair<br/>3 Cards:  Three of a Kind<br/>4 Cards:  There are no valid four-card combinations in this version of Big Two.<br/>5 Cards:  Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind (+ Any Card), Straight Flush.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208115/#Comment_208115" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T10:09:11+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 10:09AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>RANKING COMBINATIONS</b><br/><br/>The five card combinations are listed in order of rank, with a Full House beating a Straight, etc.<br/><br/>The numerical ranking of single cards in Big Two is, as its name suggests: 2, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. <br/><br/>Combinations of the same type are ranked by the highest numerically ranked card or set.  For example, a Flush 2, 10, 6, 4, 3 beats a Flush K, Q, J, 9, 8. The only exception is when comparing Full House and Four of a Kind combinations, in which case the three or four card sets are the only cards that are used for comparison. Consequently, a Full House 6, 6, 6, 3, 3 beats a full house 4, 4, 4, A, A.<br/><br/>In situations where combinations would seem to have the same value, they are ranked by the suit of the highest numerical card, using the following order: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds. For example, a 3 of Clubs beats a 3 of Diamonds; a pair of 2s (Spades, Diamonds) beats a pair of 2s (Hearts, Clubs); and a Flush 9, 7, 5, 4, 3 of Hearts beats a Flush 9, 8, 6, 5, 4 of Clubs.<br/><br/>The highest possible five-card combination in the game is a Straight Flush 2, A, K, Q, J of Spades.<br/><br/><b>PASSING</b><br/><br/>If a player has no valid combination of higher value (and containing the same number of cards) or simply wishes not to play this turn, that player passes.  This can be done either by saying \u201cPass\u201d or tapping on the table. I generally tap twice, using my first two index fingers, to make sure no mistake is made in deciphering my intentions, but do as thou wilt.<br/><br/><b>EMINENCE</b><br/><br/>If you play a valid combination that leads all the other players to pass, you have gained eminence and can play any valid combination you like, even one with lower value or containing a different number of cards than your previous play. <br/><br/>Gaining eminence is critical to controlling the way the game unfolds.  Frequently, a player dealt a superb hand will lose to a player with a poor or even abysmal hand, simply due to the latter player\u2019s ability to manage the game effectively.  While playing five-card combinations helps players shed cards quickly, if the majority of plays contain one, two, and three-card combinations, those five card combinations may never make it to the table.<br/><br/><b>WINNING</b><br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.<br/> <br/>If you like, the remaining players can continue playing to determine their final ranking, but that is not generally necessary unless you are gambling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208133/#Comment_208133" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T10:59:18+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 10:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a lot of experience playing Gang of Four, so I may not be the best person to parse your rules.<br/><br/>My strategy: win the trick (get eminence) however I can, then play those big 5 card hands.

So if you lost with 2s or 5-card combinations still in your hand, you owed the winner a bunch of money, whereas, if you lost with a 4 or a 3 left in your hand, you paid the minimum.  Or players were sometimes scored by the combinations they played (again, more like Majiang), with Straight Flushes being worth the most, etc. <br/><br/>You could also play out to the full end of the game, which was sometimes done to determine who owes whom (2nd place pays winner, 3rd place pays winner and second place, 4th place pays everyone).  This moves a lot more money around, since the winner gets paid 3 times each hand and the loser pays 3 times.  I like this method better as a simpler version of the complex scoring described above (basically: Winner +3, Second +1, Third -1, Loser -3).  You could also determine this order by the cards left after the win, and not play it out if you wanted to speed things up.<br/><br/>I've never seen people fold hands of Big Two, but it's possible I guess.  Generally speaking, though, Chinese games (frex: Majiang) don't work that way.  If you draw a bad hand, you have to try to play it as best you can and minimize the amount of money you'll end up owing others.  And in Big Two and Majiang, poor draws can often end up winning if they are played effectively, so that's part of the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208140/#Comment_208140" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T11:34:52+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 11:34AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless you want to assume familiarity with poker, you probably want to define Full House, Straight, Flush and Straight Flush.

So you have to make sure that the combinations of cards you put together in your hand can cover the crap cards as well.<br><br/>When I've played Big Two with my Chinese friends, I've found that the 4 of a kind is a REALLY useful combination, because it lets you ditch one additional card that otherwise doesn't beat anything, so there is no risk of having to play it and then get beaten in such a way that you can't take eminence back.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208153/#Comment_208153" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T12:10:32+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 12:10PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, additional note I meant to add.

Most humans only have two index fingers--one on the right hand, one on the left hand--so the use of the adjective "first" makes me go, "Huh?"<br><br>The only thing that made me double-back (because I didn't grok what was going on) was the fact that one MUST use the same number of cards as the player which opened the round (e.g. if I start a round with three 3s, then everyone must play three-card combos or pass). Funnily enough, I know I read this rule:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Additionally, each subsequent player must play the same number of cards as the first player.</blockquote>...but for some reason, it didn't stick. Maybe use a better, more-explicit example than your five-card straight example?<br/><br/>Similarly, be a bit more explicit about how ONLY the highest-ranking card's suit matters, and how it trumps the next-highest card value, as in this example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>a Flush 9, 7, 5, 4, 3 of Hearts beats a Flush 9, 8, 6, 5, 4 of Clubs <span style="color: #003399;">(i.e. the suit of the high cards matters more than the values of the next-highest card or cards)</span>.</blockquote>(Blue text is my suggested addition.)<br/><br/>Finally, I'd be sure to use the card symbols (available in most Symbol fonts) whenever possible, when referring to a HAND of cards (but NOT when referring to a card suit in rules text). Just makes it easier to quickly view. I, too, suggest that you define all the Poker hand types, with an example or two of each.<br/><br/>Pretty good tech writing, though, all-in-all. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>[edit: For typo and to try--and fail--to show card suit symbols using HTML code.]                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208156/#Comment_208156" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T12:24:31+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 12:24PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few questions:<br/>Does the ranking "loop" for straights?

Does the person who follows now have to play a 3 card combination, or does it revert to 5 card combinations?<br/>On further thinking, I suspect that after the person with Eminence plays, this must "reset" the play requirements as far as value and combination size because otherwise the hand would have to be over, but i couldn't be sure.<br/><br/>and my last (and certainly most important) question:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>using my first two index fingers</blockquote>Just how many index fingers do you have, dude? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208184/#Comment_208184" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T13:54:15+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  1:54PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone familure with Asshole here?<br/><br/>Isn't the big two that op is describing basically asshole + 2's are high, you must lead with 3spades, for some reason 4's of a kind are not laid (without an extra card), and the deal is even as apposed to putting penalty cards on people due to order of finish?<br/><br/>L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208192/#Comment_208192" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T14:40:48+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  2:40PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 2:40PM by Hans_c-o.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

The name of the game makes 2-high intuitive enough, I think.  And the reason Four of a Kind is a 5-card hand is because it needs to be able to compete with the other 5-card hands (the most valuable plays).  It's one of the rarest hands and ranks just below Straight Flush.  If it wasn't a 5-card hand, you'd get stuck with it (because you have to follow # of cards) unless you gained eminence and dropped it (in which case, nobody's likely to respond).  Both of those cases are less interesting.  In fact, contrary to your opinion about idiosyncratic local games that have rustic flavor or whatever, I find that the games that survive and rise to prominence are often remarkably well-designed.  Otherwise, people would have given up playing them a long time ago.<br/><br/>Chris, I'll check out Tichu.  I guess that's another commercial Big Two variant, like Gang of Four?  Both your and Willow's strategies make total sense to me and are things I've done before, so, yeah.  I was mostly seeing if folks had completely different strategies, which would either be 1) genius or 2) meant my rules weren't clear, so maybe they were playing differently than me?<br/><br/>Ralph again, I'm not worried about the randomness.  That works just fine for what I have in mind.  I'm not interested in an even distribution so much as the crazy workings of fate and tragedy.  Also, the way the mechanics of the game work, with Dogs-style "Gives," not every hand will play through to completion.  It will be possible to "fold" a hand in the middle if you're playing particularly poorly, more like Poker, so the overall play of the RPG is going to look a bit different, unless all parties in a conflict are playing to win and don't really care about the consequences for themselves or others.<br/><br/>Everyone, yeah, I meant my first two fingers. Thanks for catching that.<br/><br/>David, yeah, you're totally right about following number of cards and only comparing the highest card needing more emphasis.  Noted.  Ideally, there will be diagrams in the final version as well, which should help.  Card symbols, definitely.  Maybe even little icons with the letter and suit in a rounded square.<br/><br/>Brian, different variants allow or disallow looping, but I generally play with no looping, 3 is low, 2 is high, for clarity's sake (see Ralph, I do care about that).  Also, yeah, the player with eminence resets the number of cards that must be played when they make their own play.  I'll try to clarify that too.<br/><br/>Hans, Shreyas made a game a while back that used Majiang tiles.  Refreshing Rain, I think?  But you use them in the game way different than you do when normally playing Majiang.  Not, like, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_solitaire" rel="nofollow">"Shanghai" weird</a>, but still weird.

I'm supposed to teach Dev and Nathan to play Majiang, though, so who knows what'll come out of a bunch of indie designers and those addictive tiles (or what'll happen when I bring my tiles with me to Seattle and infect all you cats).</blockquote>\nOf course. Of course this already exists.<br/><br/>I think the green on the back of the tiles is my favorite color. Mahjong at its best is played with a group of loud and quarreling middle-aged-to-old Chinese women.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208280/#Comment_208280" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T07:39:52+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  7:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I find it a bit weird that some folks are taking "traditional" Chinese card games, putting weird pseudo-Asian kitsch illustrations on them and selling them as proprietary card game designs</blockquote>Very weird.  And kinda lame.  But people apparently are also willing to buy commercial sets of cards to play something like mafia/werewolf, which I don't get either.  I guess if you can make money by selling something that's already been designed, well... why wouldn't you, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208314/#Comment_208314" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T11:16:01+00:00" title="May 20, 2009 11:16AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>buy commercial sets of cards to play something like mafia/werewolf, which I don't get either</blockquote>OT, but allow me to explain why:<br/>M/WW has more than the three primary roles. It can be hard for even experienced players to remember all of the special, optional role-playing-card equivalents (my own playing-card Mafia set has the role rules on each card, and whether it's a night- or day-acting role). Plus, custom cards evoke a certain feel or mood that most playing cards don't. Further, this is all compounded when playing with totally new players; yes, folks can forget that "black is Werewolf," "red numbered cards are villagers," and "the red queen(s) is(are) the Seer(s)." It's amazing, but true.<br/><br/>Also: money. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
