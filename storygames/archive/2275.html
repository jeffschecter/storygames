                    Part I<br/><br/>NC Gameday XII just came and went and I had a wonderful time playing TSOY with some board regulars, one of my gaming group, and a person who'd never played a non-trad game in their life. This game is based on work created by Jason Morningstar, posted <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1907" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I used this for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>Jason has a keen insight into TSOY, and I respect his ideas immensely.</li>
<li>Early advertising is key for EN World Gameday if you want to guarantee participants, especially so for non-trad games.<br/></li></ol>
Rollcall:<br/>Remi: Board member, only one having played TSOY before<br/>Shane: Board member, had read the rules briefly<br/>Jon: Not a board member, never played a non-trad game before<br/>Travis: Not a board member, in my local gaming group<br/><br/>I had a full crew early on, but at the last moment a spot opened up and Remi filled in. I didn't realize it then, but having another player that had played the game made things run more smoothly. Thanks, Remi!<br/><br/>Gameday runs in two sessions. I spent the morning session planning things out. I think this is where the bulk of the AP will reflect on, so I will delve into this more deeply. Please refer to the game notes I scanned in below (you'll have to rotate it counterclockwise, I apologize):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.box.net/public/x2zz8jnfmt" rel="nofollow">Game Notes</a><br/><br/>So, I wrote down the names of the four characters on the sheet, placing them in the corners of an imaginary rectangle. I drew simple relationships between the characters (making a mistake with Theodred's connection to Kemp, btw). In the middle I wrote down Goblins, Cadfan (whom I made into a paladin), and Sword as these were established in the blurb for the game and I felt that they had to be there (truth in advertising, in that respect - I did begin the game by explaining that it wasn't going to quite be a dungeon crawl, which everyone was cool with). I then spawned off things that I thought were important based on the Keys that had been assigned to the characters. Kemp had a really neat Key that I wanted to explore so I made sure to create a Trap relationship. Aubrey and Kemp seemed a little weak, a little empty. So, I created a virtual link for Aubrey for a Key I hoped to have the player take. Still, Kemp was pitiful. Then, I noticed Kemp's Secret of the Hidden Pocket and created a link to having him be searched. Unfortunately, I never followed through with that. Still, for a con game, I felt I did an okay job hitting keys to scenes.<br/><br/>On to the second page. I created a section for NPCs. The letter to the side equals their race (which never became important for me to remember, but at the time I thought I might need to collate based on race). Giving each NPC a name (some of which come from the document, some I created on the fly), I forced myself to come up with a modified adjective to describe them. This made it incredibly easy to imaging their important characteristics. I created a Blind Oracle, a Rebel Goblin (and thus, his rebellion), and a corrupted Dwarf. The corrupted dwarf led to some of the coolest moments in the game.<br/><br/>Next, I added a Rooms section. See, I didn't have a map and I was going to need one (in terms of order of scene framing). I had to decide where I wanted an NPC to be when they were encountered. This fleshed out the dungeon quite well. I still ended up making changes, but populating the dungeon vis a vis the NPC population felt natural.<br/><br/>So, I knew I wanted the Black Pool and a room full of living statues because one was the plot and the other was something which I had easily seen in my imagination. After that, I started creating rooms based on the list of NPCs. Notice also that rooms had descriptors so as to add an angle of coolness to them. If you have questions about specific rooms, please ask. I'll just move on for now. The key point was that I had to go at least until I'd had each NPC in a room.<br/><br/>Then, I added a creatures section, adding rooms as necessary. Finally, I added an items section. I felt bad close to game start as I'd not created any magic items and I considered those integral to a dungeon crawl. I simply wrote down names and came up with attributes on the fly on the far right.<br/><br/>On the last page, I started drawing out the dungeon. I started on a thrown away sheet with a 2D dungeon which didn't give me enough umph or realism, so I dumped it for a pseduo-3D model. I actually started in the lower left, drawing a tower and a series of underground switchbacks which led to a Grand Hall. Rooms 11-13 were squeezed in at the end and aren't a part of that map.<br/><br/>Then, the room with the two exits up top leading to rooms 1 and 7 was made, being the Grand Hall. Thus, as I decided where I wanted NPCs to be met in the timeline, I was able to map the dungeon. Notice that Feshnee needed to be available early so I put him in the Library antechamber. Room 2 was a huge canyon with bridges and overlooks and was populated by a Giant Spider and her children. If they decided to go that route, they could either go through some deep tunnels to a field of lichen (5) inhabited by a troll. If they followed a crumbling path over gigantic drops, they could reach a declining slope leading to 6, the Rebel Goblin barracks.<br/><br/>Then, I started in the other direction. Room 7 led to Room 8, with the Blind Oracle. She would lead into a temple (9) and Cadfan at an underground waterfall (10). A spiraling descent led to the Goblin city. The Black Pool lay behind the great Vault.<br/><br/>I'll be back later for Part II. I have to go game with Andy, Travis, Tim and Clinton!                </div>

                            Wow, it took me a week to finish this post.<br/><br/>Part II<br/><br/>The game went pretty well. Mapping everything as a relationship kept it from being room after room of combat. I guess, in that sense, I denied the concept. However, I knew I wasn't going to emulate that part of a dungeon crawl and made it clear before the game began.<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/>Right at the beginning I threw a monster at them. It gave them a simple chance to use the system and demonstrate the dice system. For Jon, the player that hadn't played any indie games, I was able to make a very simple concept clear with one sentence and he enjoyed the rest of the game throughout:<br/><br/>They were attacked by a giant stone man wielding a large weapon. Remi's character jumped straight up, being reckless. Jon's character, trying to defend her, jumped into the fray as well. However, the only way he was going to get XP was by getting in the way and protecting her and not by simply attacking the stone giant. But, I could see it in his expression, he thought that both were available and he was considering whether he should risk his character's effectiveness for 'extra' XP.<br/><br/>I said, "Jon, you realize you won't get any XP for killing the statue-man, right? Only by what's on your character sheet ..."<br/><br/>He lit up like a light bulb, and had fun jumping in the way of the statue-man's swing.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>Shane changed his character from a maiden to a man. This made Travis' character's Unrequited Love all the more interesting. Both rolled with it quite well.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>Players quickly identified what they did and didn't like on their character sheets and work to fix it. With a con game, it can suck when you just want to make some tweaks, but the game let them and supported them for it.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>The most inspired thing I think I did was not let the Dwarf be the <i>last</i> dwarf, but the next-to-last. He showed leadership, and the manipulating bastard NPC pledged fealty to him, making him Thane/King of the remaining tribe (the two of them). After they'd defeated the Black Pool, and all of the Goblins reverted to Dwarfs (as they'd been cleansed of the curse), the Thane now had an entire kingdom (which he'd already conquered through the preaching of the cleric - something that never worked in trad dungeon crawls but worked so very well in TSOY).<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>We were able to find a way to let Remi head out early. It felt almost natural, and I was happy that it didn't kill the fun we were having.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>Jon had tons of fun. This was the first game ever (!) that he got to do exactly what he wanted with a dwarf despite years of trad gaming. <br/><br/>Travis loved my backstory, which always makes me happy.<br/><br/>Shane was a little concerned with the power of TSOY to change what his character thinks as the result of the stakes of a roll (that is, he could actually be convinced of something in character that he had no plans of being convinced of as a player). I love this kind of thing, but didn't have a good follow-up to his concern.<br/><br/>Mapping everything the way I did was tons of fun. People were concerned that I didn't have any gaming to do in the morning, but the prep time was actually quite fun.<br/><br/>I invite Shane and Remi to add anything they want, for good or ill. Travis doesn't frequent the board as far as I know.<br/><br/>P.S. Clinton was the most awesome dude ever by supplying a last minute copy of TSOY 2 Revised. Travis, Remi and I already owned the game. Shane and Jon discussed it, and Jon felt that he wouldn't be able to use it because, to game with his daughter, he'd need a game that had less open-ended options for actions. Shane took it home.                        </div>

                            Love your R-Map, Mark - that looks really cool.  I'm glad you felt good about the session and put everybody through their paces!  I can see that I ought to revise some of the PC relationships and keys a bit if it is to be run again.  Thoughts on that?                        </div>

                            The Key of Doom (which I renamed as the Key of Recklessness) can make pacing wonderful but can confound attempts at strategy, which could have been some great roleplaying scenes in my opinion. I love the Key of Incompetence and made an entire section for it (but failed to describe it well in the end, regretably).<br/><br/>I added some stuff about Cadfan being a ghost instead of a zombie. I wanted Shane to play up the lost lover bit, but it came over as cold because, well, because we weren't going down the gay route. I think that having him be just as unavailable as a zombie but making him able to have a conversation should make for some awesome in the future. Also, I made him a paladin of the Lady Peace. I thought this was a great angle but Remi wasn't interested. I'd be curious as to his opinion on what went wrong with that.<br/><br/>Other than that, things ran quite well. I never got to see if the 'rebel goblin tribe' worked or not as they didn't go that route.                        </div>
