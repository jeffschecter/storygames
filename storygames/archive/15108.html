I know it will probably make a lot of people angry since this weapon has become so overwhelmingly popular, but it\u2019s the very cause of that same popularity that needs to be addressed so urgently. Spears are way too powerful in real life and they need a serious nerf, fast.<br/> <br/>Let\u2019s go over the problems with spears.<br/> <br/><b>1) Spears are too cheap.</b><br/> <br/>Spears are essentially available at game start. You can start building spears as soon as you have the \u201cStick\u201d and either \u201cRock\u201d or \u201cFire\u201d technologies, and in fact you basically have to start massing them immediately if you want to use the Hunting skill from the get-go. Conversely, you have to wait literally ages before you can get half-decent swords or axes.<br/> <br/>Once you start upgrading weapons, the cost disparity between spears and other weapons becomes even more egregious. By mid-game, you only need wood, a little bit of metal, and an appallingly low-level Smith skill to make decent spears. Compare this to a long sword, which requires two or even three times as much metal, plus an advanced Smith skill\u2014or more probably, a later and rarer variant, like Armorer or Bladesmith. You\u2019re still hardly getting your money\u2019s worth with that expensive sword, because \u2026<br/> <br/><b>2) Spears are too easy to use.</b><br/> <br/>Using a sword effectively requires high Strength, Finesse, and Bravery ratings, plus years of practice. Using a spear effectively requires holding it in place and occasionally poking it forward with a jacking-off motion. Even if you only have staff proficiency, you can still use spears to deadly effect.<br/> <br/>As a result you see people getting lazy and using spears to counter pretty much every opposing close combat build. I might as well also mention that spears do piercing damage, the deadliest kind against unarmored or lightly armored targets. Yes, you can argue that spears are sub-par against full plate armor, but plate is unspeakably expensive and hard to use, and only available pretty late in the game. Even then, you can immediately counter it with axes and war hammers, and can only use it very briefly because most players are going to get the \u201cGunpowder\u201d tech at almost exactly the same time.<br/> <br/><b>3) Spears have too many synergies with other powerful techs.</b><br/> <br/>What do the Wilderness Scout, Shield Bearer, Formation Fighter, Horseman, and Elite Guard career paths all have in common? They all become even more broken when combined with spears. You can use spears in pretty much any role, whether from horseback, in formation in a shield wall or screening missile troops, in stealth/infiltrator roles, or when guarding important NPCs. Sure, you could get something more specialized for that role\u2014but why would you, when spears are almost as good for a fraction of the cost in time and money?<br/> <br/><b>Summary</b><br/> <br/>The result of these problems is that spears have become an inalienable component of nearly every well-known combat build: the Persian Immortals, the Greek Spartans, the Zulu ukuButbwa (yes that\u2019s a word you RACIST, Wikipedia told me), the German Landsknechte, every kind of lancer, and even many early- to mid-tier gunpowder units with the Bayonet upgrade. A lot of other builds basically have palette-swapped spears, like the Swiss Guards or the Japanese Warrior Monks.<br/> <br/>The diversity of weapons a player can choose from is supposed to make the game colorful and interesting. This diversity disappears if everyone just gets a spear; and until spears are no longer mechanically dominant in nearly every combat role, everyone is just going to get a spear.<br/> <br/>Let me stress that I\u2019m not some kind of whining grognard who complains every time a new weapon enters play: I didn\u2019t complain about stirrups or crossbows or city walls, or even the AK-47 (which is, let\u2019s face it, basically the late-game equivalent to the spear). But the spear problem is way too far-reaching to ignore.<br/> <br/>The developers need to nerf spears in every category: price, training time, priority, and damage. But the problem might be deeper than that, having to do with Reach being the dominant close combat weapon stat in this game. Moreover, they\u2019ll only contribute to the power creep and overwhelming lethality of this game if they try to solve the problem like they usually do, by buffing every other weapon\u2014except for katanas. Those are underpowered in real life.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
