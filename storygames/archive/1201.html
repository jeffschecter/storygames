                    Hey guys,<br/><br/>There's a lot to say and ask about what Ron's talking about, but his thread is already getting all crazy (not dogpile-y crazy, but just lots of people are interested crazy). I'm starting this one to, like, talk about stuff between times that Ron posts, hopefully to keep the conversation more manageable.<br/><br/>In response to Guy's comments about Polaris...<br/><br/>Yeh, Polaris was offered at the conversation as an example of a game that has a built-in de-escalation mechanic (You Ask Far Too Much), which provides kind of a "safety valve" for this kind of thing. Polaris, you will notice, has <i>absolutely no stakes-setting "phase"</i>. You create and change the stakes*, as it were, though your use of the ritual phrases. <br/><br/>*stakes here being "the fictional stuff that happens when we are done engaging in mechanics"                </div>

<p>On hindsight, none of the stuff I said had any relevance.  I'm a little too fast on the keys this morning.  Time to take a break.</p>
