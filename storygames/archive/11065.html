We played In A Wicked Age, along with two other couples, mostly non-gamers. It was a short single-chapter game, but it had some good stuff, like a magician whose particular strength was turning people into owls, an owl character (who couldn't talk) trying to win back his lover, and an unctuous bishop who we first thought was a vampire, but actually just had a skin condition that made him very sensitive to sunlight.<br/><br/>My girlfriend mostly enjoyed the game, although she's not *dying* to play again.  I enjoyed that she played "a hooded stranger", made dramatic 'whoosh' gestures to sweep the hood back from her head, and talked, yes, in-character.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245452/#Comment_245452" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T00:43:13+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 12:43AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2009 12:43AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From our "Doom of the Gods" Microscope game, a mythic age from the creation of the World of Men to the very death of the Gods (very Ragnarok):<br/><br/>The King of the Dwarves <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/120/doom-of-the-gods/" rel="nofollow">sells his people into slavery to the Gods</a> in exchange for the gift of craftsmanship, which he then teaches all his people to cheat the gods.

I'm really digging all the changes so far.  A great game is becoming even better.<br/><br/>At one point, David's character, Dr. Madhawk (ex-Stygian mystic professor from Pluto) stabbed an enchanted silver rod into the eye-socket of the ancient giant robot head that was being revived by a cult of feral Saturnine robots. Rolling 5 Danger, this resulted in a disaster in which Dr. Madhawk's being was itself sucked into the shadowy mystery within the robot godhead, potentially imprisoning him for all time if not for the efforts of Dr. Madhawk and his companions. When the revived robot godhead was finally defeated, Dr. Madhawk reemerged, unconscious, and looming over him stood his suppressed dark Stygian evil twin, separated out from him Adam Warlock-style.<br/><br/>Also, there were voidsharks. And a fleeting glimpse of the greater undead robot diety that lies in wait like Azathoth at the center of the Negaverse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245980/#Comment_245980" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-09T14:22:20+00:00" title="December  9, 2009  2:22PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "This isn't the first ancient robot god head I've had to deal with, Professor!"<br/><br/>- RD44, Robot Explorer                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246122/#Comment_246122" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T15:38:47+00:00" title="December 10, 2009  3:38PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2009 11:20AM by johnzo.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 4E.  <br/><br/>The scene: the Cathedral of Bahamut in Mesa Bravo, a town that is suffering through a terrible famine.  Led by a revered priestess, the town's elderly residents have sequestered themselves in the Cathedral's sanctuary.  They are refusing all food, sacrificing themselves to give the young ones a better chance at life.<br/><br/>Enter our Deva Avenger of Bahamut, hell-bent on reviving a thousand-year-old church that he believes to be fat and corrupt.  He tells the priestess his good news -- revival is coming!  <br/><br/>Her reaction surprises him.  "Why must you multiply my suffering a thousandfold, astral traveler?" she asks, weeping.  "The Church is all we have left, and now you have come to spark a war within it?" <br/><br/>The Avenger absorbs this rebuke silently.  Then he goes elsewhere in the church, gathers those acolytes who will listen, and says the sermon of revival to them.<br/><br/>I really dig moral clarity.  In games, anyway.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the Avenger's dice went very soft just then, and even with some funky deva rerolls and +1d6s, he just barely made his Religion check to say the sermon.  I had previously told him he had to hit DC+5 to get the entire congregation onside, so I ruled that just half of the acolytes of the Church of Mesa Bravo have chosen to side with him against the establishment.  I love oracular dice almost as much as I love moral clarity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246136/#Comment_246136" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T17:42:07+00:00" title="December 10, 2009  5:42PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Also, there were voidsharks.

(Curse you! I had a great <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i> scenario all prepped!) The first scene was unmanageable - keeping track of all the Guiding Questions was too much overhead for the Traveler. We came up with a quick hack, where instead of having everyone ask a GQ,  the Traveler had to get questions from three people, two of whom hadn't been asked in the previous turn. This made everything go much faster and more easily - we finished the entire game in four hours - while keeping everyone involved.<br/><br/>It was the first GMless game for half of the participants and frankly we pinned the gonzometer, as the text warns can happen the first time out. I did my best to add grim-n-gritty in the beginning, but the lure of silliness proved very strong and I just went with the flow once the mood of the table was apparent. What was cool was that certain characters wound up recurring in all of our memories, tying them together a bit in space and time. We didn't know each other, as it turned out, but at least we were all living in the same world, and we'd had a few near-misses at meeting before amnesia brought us together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247354/#Comment_247354" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T12:13:30+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 12:13PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Lady Blackbird: </b>More fun per square inch than any game I've played in years.<br/><br/>Highlights include: A successful escape from the Hand of Sorrow, a scuttling of the engine room, dead Imperial Marines everywhere (four shot, one dead from a horrific de-arming, and six incinerated by lightning magic), Snargle turning into a big fat ball to help right a fallen ship, a scuttled clockwork automata whose vitals were hidden behind a plate reading "DO NOT OPEN - No User Serviceable Parts Inside", a love poem written on the back of ship schematics, several tense conversation shouted over the ship's wireless, some daredevil piloting, and two huge fires.<br/><br/>It was like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, but not sucky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247366/#Comment_247366" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T12:45:50+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 12:45PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="Soft%20Horizon%20character%20Kar.png" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.vsca.ca/SoftHorizon/images/Soft%20Horizon%20character%20Kar.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247405/#Comment_247405" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T15:34:18+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  3:34PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played a seven-man session of ARKHAM HORROR today.<br/><br/>It was a surreal experience fora  long-time RPG-er. The game is strongly reminiscent of convention-style one-shots of rules-heavy role-playing games games like D&amp;D or (non-purist) CofC. But it's a traditional board game in the sense that thee are clearly specified winning conditions (which are achieved by the players collaboratively) and no roleplay that anyone actually engages in has any effect on states of the game.<br/><br/>We had fun, and even generated a little atmosphere - the game is lovingly produced, with hundreds of teeny cardboard tokens and wonderfully written encounters. And the collaborative element was fun - after working at cross purposes for a while (my character was committed to the Asylum three separate times) we got it together enough eventually to prevent the great Cthulhu himself from invading the town of Arkham. But I have to admit that I came out of it thinking, why would anyone actually design a game like this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince" title="Irishvince"><img alt="Irishvince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/464/n77MQHB4WLBHG.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince">Irishvince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247499/#Comment_247499" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T10:50:34+00:00" title="December 18, 2009 10:50AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MORDECAI (the Relic Hunter) speaks quietly so the onlookers across the room can't hear.
