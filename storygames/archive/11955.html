One player is the detective: his job is to 'solve" the murder.  <br/><br/>Everyone else plays a suspect: their goal in character is to <em>make the detective declare that they are the murderer</em>.  Who actually killed the victim isn't defined until end of play: each person comes up with a motive for their character, and will have the ability to plant clues throughout the game (a limited number, perhaps, or some sort of clue economy where the authority to introduce new clues moves around from player to player).<br/><br/>But in character, the suspects want to avoid being caught.  So they can't ever state that they are the murderer, and they need to avoid directly revealing their motive or how they could have done it.  (Maybe the clue economy can be used here to avoid people acting too overtly like the murderer.)<br/><br/>After some amount of time, the detective decides that he has enough evidence to solve the case, fingers someone, and tries to explain away any conflicting evidence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mainly, I'm thinking about the tension between suspect player and suspect character, and how that tension could be used to produce satisfying gameplay.  And if this could be used to create a near zero prep LARP or tabletop game.  (For a LARP especially, suspects should have their own interrelations and the clue economy should encourage them to interact away from the detective.)  But would this work?  Would it crash and burn in some obvious way I'm missing?  Any way to make it better?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267135/#Comment_267135" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T12:18:13+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 12:18PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The murderer had an accomplice.

Then your goal could be to get the most convictions without getting a perfect score, or something similar. This should prevent some of the unwanted tension over what is and what isn't acceptable in-character behaviour, as you wouldn't want your character to be quite too obvious as a suspect.<br/><br/>In fact, thinking on it further, what you want to do is to have a rote turnaround at the end of the game: have the detective accuse somebody dramatically, but then immediately afterwards have some critical evidence surface that specifically disqualifies the first suspect, leaving the detective to pick on the second-most likely. It fits the genre and ensures that the players will try to get to be second-most suspected instead of first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267161/#Comment_267161" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T14:19:20+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  2:19PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the game might get away with a rule for acting too overtly that relies on clue tokens:  If you act in a way that strongly suggests that you are the murderer, that is itself a clue, so you need to spend a clue token to do so.

If this happens, everyone else loses.<br/>- Everyone else's goal is to BE the murderer, but lead the detective to PIN the wrong person. That player is the winner, and everyone else loses.</blockquote>\nI guess you'd have to have the suspect players vote for who the murderer is, and have the detective declare who the murderer is without knowing the result of the vote (perhaps he decides and writes it down before the vote).  So the detective is trying to pick the same as the vote goes, but the suspects are trying to be chosen by vote but not fingered by the detective.  That gives you some tension right there, though I don't know how well balanced that would be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
