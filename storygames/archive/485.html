                    I like puzzles in computer games. <br/>
<br/>
For example, in Knights of the Old Republic, there's a puzzle where you have to interview people who were around a murder scene, and work out who's lying. And you interview them, and one of them mentions he was blinded by the sun while aiming his gun, but then you remember it was a cloudy day on the day of the murder, so you know he's lying.<br/>
<br/>
Or there's one in Jade Empire which is a logic puzzle. You're having a debate and you have to persuade five judges. And each of them likes a different sort of argument (arguments from history, arguments from science etc) and each of them dislikes one of those sorts of argument. So you have to work out which arguments to use to persuade all five judges.<br/>
<br/>
Or then there's a logic puzzle in KOTOR, where you have to work out the serial numbers of spacecraft, but there's parts missing from all the serial numbers, but you know certain details about how some digits relate to other digits, so you can work it out.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes. Logic puzzles and mathematics puzzles and "work it out from a story" puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
How would I put these into a roleplaying game? Bear in mind that I don't particularly want the GM to have to go away and design these puzzles one by one. At the very least, I'd like some kind of guide of how to design these puzzles. But is there an even more elegant solution than that?<br/>
<br/>
Also, bear in mind that I'm not after the "Inspectres" solution of getting the players to solve their own puzzles. I think that's a great idea but it's not quite what I'm looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>

                            I think it's a terrible idea to put those puzzles in, and have the action come to a screeching halt until the players figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, you put them in as side-pieces that they can chew on at their leisure, as other things are going on.                        </div>

                            Yeah, that's good advice: Don't require them to get through the scenario, but have them there so that they can address the puzzle as they see fit over the next few hours or session while they do other things (5 hours later: "I got it!" etc).<br/><br/>Cause again, poor implementation, or even good implementation but bad luck, can bring your game session or campaign to a screeching, crashing halt.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Unless, of course, the players also love puzzels and figuring out the puzzels is a major goal of play. <br/><br/>Historically a large part of the problem with puzzels in games is that they were roadblocks. You'd be tooling along, doing your thing, and then WHAM -- no more fun until you figure out this thing that the GM thinks should be easy but that is so not. This becomes especially stupid when it gets to the point of analog style pixelclicking. <br/><br/>However, I've played in dungeon delving games in which the puzzels were the point. We'd sit through the boring fights until we got to the cool puzzels. The GM for this game would set up intricate real world examples of the puzzels -- flip tile chessboards, tinkertoy scale models, and all kinds of crazy shit -- and then we'd have a blast trying to figure out what was going on. In a very real way we were gaming for the puzzel, and thus it wasn't a roadblock. <br/><br/>So, with that in mind, it would seem to me the place to start is by designing a game to build these puzzels. Make puzzel creation like town creation in Dogs, or villain creation in With Great Power.                        </div>

                            I would love a game like that.  I remember the old King's Quests (I-VI) quite fondly.  :)  And I wish they still made games like that.<br/>

                            This is a toughie. I have to admit the one time I did use in-character riddles, I absolutely cheated on an out-of-character level.  Here's the story:<br/><br/>The characters were Year One Gotham City broody angsty vigilante superheroes.<br/><br/>One day I started the session by saying: "You've been chasing the Riddler for two months. He's always gotten the better of you. But now you've got him, you figured everything out and he's <i>right there laughing at you</i> as he runs for the rooftop stairs."<br/><br/>The important thing to note is that the Riddler had never appeared or been mentioned before. I had in fact jumped forward in time about 10 weeks from the time at the end of the last session.<br/><br/>Then while the heroes were chasing the Riddler (and dealing with his deathtraps and so on), I flashed back to their lives, activities, and so on, during that 10 week period, including his riddles. <br/><br/>So there was absolutely zero out-of-character pressure to solve these riddles, none. It was a cheat. We all knew they were going to figure them out eventually, and end up at the endpoint chasing the Riddler. That wasn't an issue.<br/><br/>Thus, when the first batch of riddles were tricks and the Riddler got the best of them (in flashbacks), you should have HEARD the howl that went up from the group. They were SO ready to nail that little sniggering bastard! And that energy went right into the "real time" chase scene in a huge way.<br/><br/>My thinking on planning this was: what's so much fun about the Riddler as a villain? "Look out world, here comes a guy who has all the powers of a regular criminal only he's easier to catch." --- Seanbaby.  Really, it wasn't the riddles, it wasn't even Batman being smart figuring out the riddles, it was the <i>whole insane concept of a dude in a green question mark suit leaving clues behind intentionally</i> that was fun. The riddles were just the icing on the insanity cake. I didn't need to try to come up with riddles (they would have sucked) and the group didn't need to try to actually solve them (they would have disliked it). What I had to do was just pull a different chunk of the source material out and play that, make the riddles go into the background, serve to demonstrate first his cleverness (ha ha, I beat you!) and then their superior cleverness (ha ha, we beat you this time!)<br/><br/>Hope this example helps.                        </div>
