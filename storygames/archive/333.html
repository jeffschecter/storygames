                            I think this is an excellent idea, but can I mention a thing that bugs me without derailing the thread (apart from the use of DM instead of GM)? Theme is not something you address, it's something you create by addressing premise (or do you prefer to prefix a theme, Will, because I think that fits this play preference with Kickers and Bangs very badly). Vincent writes nicely about it in [[http://www.lumpley.com/creatingtheme.html|Creating Theme]] Whisper me if I'm way off.<br/>
<br/>
I think Bangs are pretty hard as well, but not on a generic basis, it's very dependent on the specific game. I find it darn hard to come up with Bangs for my TSOY game while in modern Sorcerer I didn't have any problems.<br/>

                            It's okay to use examples from games we've played in, right?<br/><br/>This is from a Charnel Gods game run by Rob Macdougall:<br/><br/>Game: Er, can I just link to Rob's <a href="http://robotnik.livejournal.com/50783.html" rel="nofollow">trailer</a>?<br/><br/>Character: Frost Morning Moon, the General in the aforementioned, is the bearer of a fell weapon that encourages both loyalty and betrayal.  Her army, the largest and most powerful in the land, has never been defeated.<br/><br/>Kicker: At the start of the game she is returning from another impressive victory with a huge army at her back, and her supporters and detractors both are convinced she's coming back to take down the current dynasty and crown herself Empress.  It would be easy for her to do, and possibly good for the Empire as well.  Only one catch: she's secretly in love with the Emperor.                        </div>

                            Perhaps this would work even better if we did it like the Art Deco Melodrama threads on the Forge? <br/><br/>For now, I'll kick in these characters: <br/><br/>Game: Sorcerer, the Punk Age. A game set in the 1970s in New York or Chicago, amid the mob, gangs, drugs, and the thrashing rage of punk music. The asphault is hot, the concreat is stained with blood and broken with the trod of uncaring feet, and the clubs are close, stinking, and filled with simmering rage that could peel the 100 year old paint right off the walls. <br/><br/>Themes: What is the roll of rage in modern society? <br/><br/>Character: Tommy is a punk musician, a boy from the worst neighborhood who joined a gang to stay alive. His best freind Jeter was the hardass for them both, and kept Tommy alive by doing the things no one else would. Jeter went to jail for it, he asked Tommy to take care of his mom. Jeter's mom, Helen, is fucking a made man in the mob. Tommy is an obsessive type of guy, and finds it impossible to let anything go once he's had a taste of it. He also has a demon in his guitar that makes him rock hard enough to get noticed by the labels, but it feeds off the sharp pain of sudden breaks. It wants to drive Tommy to suicide, but not before he's left a trail of pain and glory behind him. Better to kill your master once your master has done something worth remembering, after all. <br/><br/>Relevant Connections: Jeter just got out of jail. He's drunk and pissed all the time. His dad is coming back to town, and that's so bad it scares even Jeter. Helen's mob lover is now well up the chain of command, but not high enough for him, and is starting to take his frustrations out on her face. Tommy's band is getting tired of his connections to the old neighborhood, they all want to move on. Oh yea, and Tommy is fucking Helen. <br/><br/>Kicker: Jeter, drunk and pissed, just walked in and found Tommy fucking Helen. He's got a gun and not a lot to live for. <br/><br/>Bangs?                        </div>

                            Peaseblossom, <br/><br/>I've a penchant for romantic melodrama, so my first thoughts for bangs revlove around things like this. With more connections to the character (you skipped that part), and if I, ya know, knew you, I'd change these around to hit things you'd want. So, from the top of my head:<br/><br/>At some point, fairly soon on I think, I'd just about have to have the Emperor show up, alone and without guards, in FMM's tent and speak to her with great passion about her plans for the future. Offers of love, affairs, marriage, and other honors would quite possibly entail. If that isn't feasable, then a messanger bearing a letter may have to suffice. <br/><br/>I'd also have to have one of her captains, the most brave and dashing and loyal, confess love to her. <br/><br/>Then the barbarian cheiftain who also has a fell weapon and is her equal in many ways, a man willing to remake the empire for the good, would propose an alliance. <br/><br/>One of her maids, who has always been close and trusted to her body, would tell her that she had proof that the Lord Executioner was coming for her. Vanishing not long after might follow. <br/><br/>Villagers, fleeing from between the monk and the emperor and the army, would steal from her and her troops. Or perhaps her troops, glorious defenders of the empire and led by a strong captain who is known for his pride and vengeful streak, would be found raping village women. <br/><br/>A ghost of one of her departed loved ones would come bearing news that their shrine had been desecrated. One of her other connections would be implicated.                        </div>

                            - Tommy's band is looking into buying a bus and it is demonic...or maybe it is something to be Pacted like the beasts in S&amp;S.<br/>
<br/>
 - Tommy shows up to band practice to find Jeter's dad talking it up with them, telling them stories of the days when rock was just being born and he was a manager.  The band is eating it up and it is just a matter of moments before this psychopath offers to manage their band and get them out of this shit-hole town (is the bus this guy's demon?  Hm, something to think about.)<br/>
<br/>
 - Jeter's cell mate comes looking for him and he doesn't seem too pleased, something about a score Jeter made when he got out that was his cellmate's idea.<br/>
<br/>
 - The mobster invites Tommy to dinner.<br/>
<br/>
 - Battle of the Bands down the Jersey Shore!<br/>
<br/>
 - Helen confesses that she has been selling info to the feds and has been for some while in order to keep Jeter safe while he was in the can.  The fed is a sorcerer.                        </div>

                            Game:  Robbing Imperial Banks in the Star Wars universe.  Star Wars meets Resevoir Dogs and the bank guards are stormtroopers, so we don't have to feel bad.  Mountain Witch, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
"Did you kill any people?"<br/>
<br/>
"Real people?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah."<br/>
<br/>
"Nah, just Imperials."<br/>
<br/>
Themes: I don't know if its a theme but I want to fuck the Star Wars universe up and leave a big inky stain on it.  As a matter of fact the players might get XP through effing up continuity.<br/>
<br/>
Character: The bastard son of Palpatine, a frustrated quasi-Jedi played by a young Harvey Kietel.<br/>
<br/>
Relavent Connections: The posse, a wookie convinct just out of the slammer, an AWOL Emperor's Guard, a scumbag bounty hunter/diplomat from Jabba and a droid with its no-kill switch turned off are all holed up on the shit-side of Coruscant planning the hiest.<br/>
<br/>
Kicker: Bastard Palpatine's astromech droid just spewed up a holographic message from an Imperial insider saying that someone from their hole up's location sent out a message to an orbiting Star Destroyer in the past twenty four hours.<br/>
<br/>
The plans are done and it was just a matter of figuring out who ratted and if the entire hiest should be shit-canned.<br/>
<br/>
Bangs, please...                        </div>

In my version, this is through actually raising the issue of Faith vis a vis moral authority.<br/><br/>Character: A Dark Side Jedi who's a <em>good guy</em>. No, seriously. Call him Trigone.<br/><br/>Relavent Connections: (Former) Master that he still has cordial conversation with (who hadn't ratted on him). Light Side Padawan who he doesn't still have cordial convo with. A-Force-ist? (doesn't believe in the moral authority of the Force) Jedi who's now non-practicing. DS padawan who's starting to do disturbing stuff--not to the point of burning small animals, but past giving people ugly looks.<br/><br/>Kicker: He's been trying to figure out how to tell the Jedi community that he's not, you know, one of the good guys any more. So his disillusioned Light Side padawan decided to help him out by forcing the issue--while he's talking to the High Command or whatever the heck the Master Circle is called.                        </div>

<br/>
1. The wookie convict's probation officer calls him. As a result, he's required to go check in Right Now.<br/>
<br/>
2. The building super knocks on the door looking for rent.<br/>
<br/>
3. The killbot goes nuts and tries to kill one/some/all of you.<br/>
<br/>
4. The AWOL guard's crime (betrayal:treason and attempted assassination of your dad) comes in over the news with a reward more than any one person's projected take.<br/>
<br/>
5. The Bounty hunter's boss (Consul? something) shows up and demands a cut that hardly makes this job worth it.<br/>
<br/>
6. (after 5) Palpatine tries to possess you. Because you're not just his son--you're his clone.<br/>
<br/>
7. Your kid sister is hiding in the ventilation with her 14 yo friend. She's always looked up to you, and she followed you from home the last time you visited.<br/>
<br/>
8.  (after 6) Whether or not Palpatine succeeds, it looked like you just went mental and had a mpd psychotic break.                        </div>

                            I think we should keep this thread as is -- though perhaps with more discussion of the kickers and bangs provided.<br/><br/>However, another thread where we do an Art Deco style setup and talk about it and what we're doing step by step might be helpful for people. Seeing bangs after they've been generated can be a good thing, but being on the inside when they're being generated and seeing why they come out as they do might be better. <br/><br/>For example, the first bang I did for peaseblossom I quite liked because no matter how the character reaponds, there is going to be shit hitting the fan. It's obviously an issue for the character/player -- the whole kicker revolves around it. So, being me, I'd go to shove that shit into overdrive ASAP. Have the emperor come in, get the love out in the open between the two of them. Then play up the complexity of the situation. Is he in love with her too? Is it all politics? Can he be trusted? Even if he is in love will he betray her later? Are there other women in love with him, powerful princesses who may not like the general? Will they betray her? Him? Turn her own men against her? If she says no, what then? Will he ever trust her again? And if she kills him... my oh my....<br/><br/>So when I sat down and read the words "powerful victorious general, could overthrow the emperor, but secretly in love with him" I knew that I wanted to get her in a room with the emperor as fast as possible. Or at least have a messanger, something that would push that button fast and in a way that would make any choice the character makes shake the whole structure of the game. <br/><br/>The later bangs are things I usually put into group games where there isn't a central party -- stuff to give the protgaonists reason to cross each other's paths. Not things that mandate they be on the same side, or be opposed, but things that give them reason to get into each others world and see how big and bad the other is. <br/><br/>The middle bangs were things that could happen with the army, general questions for a general, things that let the player show what kind of leader, what kind of moral force, and what kind of commander the character is. They also have the advantage of working with the bigger bangs pretty freely. No matter what she does with the emperor or the ghosts, for example, one of her captains can always be caught doing something regretable. <br/><br/>And that's why I came up with the bangs I did.                        </div>

<br/>
1. Helen's phone rings and you pick up. It's her mob lover.<br/>
<br/>
2. A fan starts leaving messed up worshipful letters.  <br/>
<br/>
3. Your band emembers tell you that you're getting too violent, and they're going to have to let you go.<br/>
<br/>
4. One band member comes to you and says he thinks another guy isn't pulling his weight. So you should definitely leave him behind.<br/>
<br/>
5. The band member who's "not pulling his weight" is having problems. Mafia problems.<br/>
<br/>
6. Your demon cowers whenever a particular rival band's name is mentioned. It's the name of an ancient badass demon whose need fits the recent serial rapes reported in the paper.<br/>
<br/>
7. The fan starts leaving surprises for you to find. They're pictures of Helen in flagrante delicto.<br/>
<br/>
8. Jeter walks in beat up. He says, just wait'll you see what happened to the other guy, buy his story doesn't ring true.<br/>
<br/>
9. Jeter's dad's having lunch with Helen's (first) boyfriend.<br/>
<br/>
10. Helen says she's pregnant.                        </div>

                            Now, to talk about my reaction to Judd's bangs.<br/><br/>First, let me say I like em all and as Judd doesn't know me from a whole in the ground, I think he did a mighty fine job. Coming up with bangs for people I don't know is always harder on me, and so its interesting to see how people do it for total strangers on the net. <br/><br/>Now: <br/><br/>"- Tommy's band is looking into buying a bus and it is demonic...or maybe it is something to be Pacted like the beasts in S&amp;S."<br/><br/>This one doesn't grab me. Probably due to my bad experiences with a bus in a Changeling game. I see where Judd is coming at it from, but mostly it wouldn't explode in play. However, as it deals with demons and people I care about it would still generate some reaction. When it finishes we can always move on. <br/><br/>"- Tommy shows up to band practice to find Jeter's dad talking it up with them, telling them stories of the days when rock was just being born and he was a manager. The band is eating it up and it is just a matter of moments before this psychopath offers to manage their band and get them out of this shit-hole town (is the bus this guy's demon? Hm, something to think about.)"<br/><br/>This one makes me feel sick. I see Jeter's dad as being so fucked up that it makes me want to puke to think on this one. All of a sudden the guy I pictured as this big looming enemy is a part of my life and hanging with my mates. That's fucked up, and I honestly don't know how the character would react. It would, however, be awesome. Also, the idea of linking him to the bus makes the bus more interesting. <br/><br/>"- Jeter's cell mate comes looking for him and he doesn't seem too pleased, something about a score Jeter made when he got out that was his cellmate's idea."<br/><br/>Good bang for some action, from the sounds of it. It'd let me show the not good side of Tommy, which is something as he'd probably be looking a bit to helpful and shiney in the other bangs of helping his mates. I don't see things going well for this guy, though it'd also all depend on how the GM spun it. <br/><br/>"- The mobster invites Tommy to dinner."<br/><br/>This makes me feel sick. In a good way. Like... ugh. <br/><br/>"- Battle of the Bands down the Jersey Shore!"<br/><br/>This one would work well after another bang, I think. Like in the middle of dealing with the pyscho and the FBI, all of a sudden he has to have his shit together for a gig. Also, it'd let him rock out with demonic might -- and a chance to be the king is always nice. <br/><br/>"- Helen confesses that she has been selling info to the feds and has been for some while in order to keep Jeter safe while he was in the can. The fed is a sorcerer."<br/><br/>Combine this one with the mobster inviting Tommy to dinner, and you might make me either puke from pure nerves or jump up and down going "OH FUCK I'M GONNA FUCK HIM UP!" <br/><br/>Either way, golden bang.                        </div>

                            Wil, <br/><br/>I'm loving your bangs too. I like how they revolve around sex, violence, the band, and the mob -- and start to push and pull them together and apart.  Number 6 is honestly the one that interests me least -- but if it was tied into the others it could rock. <br/><br/>1, 2, 5, 7, and 10 together are giving me feelings, feelings of sickness and megaviolence.                        </div>

1. The Emperor bids you to an audience. When you approach, the guards indicate that he requires you to disarm.<br/>
<br/>
2. The Emperor confesses he thinks one of his (other) advisors is plotting against him, and that he thinks things are desperate. He wants you to help him disappear.<br/>
<br/>
3. Someone else (the monk?) admits to loving you. <br/>
<br/>
4. Someone else (not the one in 3) tries to seduce you [cross with someone who desires political advantage over you].<br/>
<br/>
5. The Emperor favors you with a love-token (something suitable to you and Wuxia cinema).<br/>
<br/>
6. The Emperor's handmaid comes after you with a knife.<br/>
<br/>
7. The Emperor disappears.<br/>
<br/>
8. The barbarians invade. Their leader slips past you while you're buchtering his men--he's going for the heart of the Empire! <br/>

                            Game: Summer and Autumn period China, focusing on the embattled mountain kingdom of Ba being squeezed by hungry neighbors.  Action!  Drama!  Not so much hewing to historical accuracy.<br/><br/>Themes: Mystical heroism and sacrifice for patriotic ideals - "We are the five claws of the white tiger of Ba!"  The ancestors are always present.  <br/><br/>Character: Xiong Hu, duellist, warrior, paragon of virtue.  An Gao, mercenary roughneck and spirit-talker with a heart of gold.   XiÃƒÂ o HÃƒÂ³uzi, trouble-maker, horseman, and optimist.  <br/><br/>Relavent Connections: All are deeply rooted in the kingdom of Ba and want to see it return to glory (it is currently enmeshed in a bloody three-way civil war orchestrated by outside factions - the Chu, the Shu, and the Qin).  There is an evil sorcerer in the wings (Yao the unclean), good Duke Ba Xia Qiang in hiding, the decadent king of Ba siding with the Shu, the hated schemer Lady Chu Fa Chien.<br/><br/>Kicker: PCs are trapped in the southern Chu city of Chang Sha, far from home, which is surrounded and besieged by Qing Ye's barbarian horde and sure to fall.  Qing Ye and the PC Xiong Hu are in love with beautiful Princess Chu Shuang Yue, who was hiding as a peasant under the PCs protection and has been smuggled out of the city with only an unreliable boy soldier for protection.  The barbarian war-lord Qing Ye holds the infant son of the King of Ba and his now-dead sister (!) as a hostage.  The PCs, bound by honor and tempted by glory, have pledged to fight to defend civilization.  The battle has been joined.                        </div>

I can't decide between a. Jeter accidentally shoots Helen or b. breakfast the next morning with Tommy, Jeter and Helen.  I suppose depending on the type of game you could combine the two for c. breakfast the next morning with Tommy, Jeter, and Helen's corpse.<br/>
<br/>
Tommy's band gets a really good gig... at the mobster's club uptown.  It's a disco club.<br/>
<br/>
One of Tommy's bandmates (one who's actually talented) keeps picking fights with Jeter.  It's actually because he (the bandmate) has a crush on him (Jeter), but whether or not that comes out depends on how the situation gets handled.                        </div>

<br/>
Said padewan is already in custody and being transported to Coruscant by bounty hunters.<br/>

Trigone's current padewan has developed an interest in a young lady that might just be a crush.  Or it might not.                        </div>

                            I don't actually know how to write Bangs.  Here's my stab at it for Jason's kicker, anyway  (note that I am assuming that the second hostage is the king's sister, not the king's son's sister):<br/>
<br/>
1) A blind man appears in the PCs' headquarters, saying he has a message from the King's dead sister to her son.<br/>
<br/>
2) Yao the Unclean offers the PCs a secret way out of the city--if they'll swear to bring him Qing Ye's hostage, the baby prince.<br/>
<br/>
3) Qing Ye challenges Xiong Hu to single combat for the gate of Chang Sha.<br/>
<br/>
4) Lady Chu Fa Chien offers the PCs a chance to cripple the Shu--because she's thrown in with the Qin.<br/>
<br/>
5) One of the PCs catches the Princess Chu Shuang Yue in her boy-soldier's bed.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks, Jess. I really like your bangs. Your third one is probably the most intriguing. It <br>
<br>
So the general principle I'm going to hypothete here is: there exist "some things that make us all the same," in the words of Jake Elwood. I like Fred's formulation: Violence, Sex, Family, Art, Money, God. So grabbing someone with a bang is the art of intersecting a situation 1) begging moral statement that 2) your subject will find interesting.<br>
<br>
The purpose of stating that principle was to invite, in order of preference, correction or deconstruction. (I'm also entertaining the thought of splitting this generalizing to a different thread, if you guys would find rumination distracting.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Will, <br><br>Depends on the game, really. And even in the biggest "we're all the same" categories the devil is still going to be in the details. For example: <br><br>Violence will grab me unless I'm playing a lower key game, in which case it will bore me silly. <br><br>Sex will usually get me, but only if its sex I find sexy, a fine point that most TV shows miss, as well as one I've had several GMs fumble. <br><br>Family is good, if my character cares about family. If you take "family" to mean "group from which ego identification comes" then you're probably onto a universal for my gaming. <br/><br/>Art, frankly, is probably gonna leave me yawning most of the time. Cultural inversions, however, will get the reaction you're looking for. <br/><br/>God is a tricky one. I'm religious IRL, so God is something that has enormous explosive potential with me, but it also has enormous potential to be trite, overdone, and dealing with questions I've so thoroughly dealt with in my real life that dealing with them in game is going to lack all energy.<br/><br/>So I do think that starting with your big six (whatever you find them to be) is a good way to start, but it always seems to work out best when you focus it on the actual people you're playing with rather than going for the general. <br/><br/>Jess, <br/><br/>Jeter shooting Helen works best, I think. Having Helen dead could be awesome, but I'd feel cheated if it was introduced flat rather than being the result of something I'd done or decided. Helen's too big a character to kill off to form a bang at the start of the game, I'm thinking. <br/><br/>I like the disco club idea. I could totally see it starting like it was a funny scene about punks at a disco, and then the mobster walks in while they're talking all kinds of shitÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. That's good stuff there. <br/><br/>The third bang is pretty good as well. I'm not sure how Tommy feels about homosexuality, and that would give me a chance to explore it. Of course, considering we're dealing with themes of violence and rage, I don't see it going well. Which is good, of course. <br/><br/>So, what did you think about the bangs I did for you?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Hi, all. These threads are fun!</p>
<p>I ran the original Wuxia Charnel Gods game that Jess (peaseblossom) references above. It was the 1st time playing Sorcerer for any of us; it was good but might not have lived up to the terrible awesomeness that was Jess and the other players' original characters and kickers. (Seriously. I need to post the lot of them sometime so you can see what a Gordian knot of blood opera they voluntarily inflicted upon themselves.)</p>
<p>Brand and Will, I like the bangs you suggested for that game a lot. Next time I play Sorcerer I'm definitely enlisting you both in the planning stages.</p>
<p>I've got some responses to some of what you said. I'll try to draw broader lessons or questions out of each of them so this doesn't just become me writing an Actual Play post.</p>
<p><em>Brand said:</em></p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>At some point, fairly soon on I think, I'd just about have to have the Emperor<br/>
  show up, alone and without guards, in FMM's tent and speak to her with great<br/>
  passion about her plans for the future. ...<br/>
  So, being me, I'd go to shove that shit into overdrive ASAP. <br/>
  Have the emperor come in, get the love out in the open between<br/>
  the two of them. Then play up the complexity of the situation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You're right about needing to push that first bang early and hard. We did have this happen, more or less, but I ought to have done it sooner. My concept of the Emperor was that he was a once fierce warrior, but now essentially imprisoned by his scheming wives and mandarins and bodyguards, and my concept of his relationship with Jess' character was that he did love her but it was all very tightly repressed. (Humanity in this game = keeping to your proper place in society, so choices about loyalty and hierarchy etc. were all front and center.) But those choices made it hard logistically to get them alone together, and when they were alone together, made it harder to get their unspoken love out on the table.</p>
<p><em>Lesson / question for discussion:</em> Some kinds of stories are harder to tell in games than others. Repressed emotions are hard because they're, you know, repressed. Should I have run the Emperor like a Dogs NPC with his heart on his sleeve and his wants and desires all right out in the open? Some of the scenes with Frost Morning Moon and the Emperor were <em>really hard</em> to play, in the sense that it taxed my mediocre acting abilities to the limit. (Jess, btw, is a really good in-game actress - she runs circles around me.) On the other hand, I thought some of the scenes got some power out of what was not being said. (Some of these scenes were even kinda hot, actually, but that discussion would take us into a whole other weird area.) How do the rest of you handle stories about powerful but repressed emotions?</p>
<p><em>Will said:</em></p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>The Emperor's handmaid comes after you with a knife.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>and Brand said:</em></p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Then the barbarian cheiftain who also has a fell weapon and is her equal<br/>
  in many ways, a man willing to remake the empire for the good, would<br/>
  propose an alliance.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I lump these two together because the first one did happen in our game and the second one was part of my plans, more or less, but both had similar outcomes.</p>
<p>There was a barbarian chieftain with a fell weapon who I was going to have propose an alliance to Jess' character. But she cleaved him in two in the very first roll of the game. And the Emperor's handmaid, actually an assassin in his court, came after Jess' character in the night, but she defeated her effortlessly too.</p>
<p><em>Lesson:</em> My only point here is to underscore something we probably all already know about bangs: You've got to have a bunch of them ready, because some are just not going to go off. Especially in a game like Charnel Gods, when the PCs are combat monsters - you can't count on anybody staying alive for long.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>I'd also have to have one of her captains, the most brave and dashing and loyal, confess love to her.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That's a good one, except that her most brave and loyal captain was her son. This game was the first time I'd ever GMed a game where one of the PCs was a mother, and it was so novel and cool to me that a bunch of my bangs for Frost Morning Moon involved her kids.</p>
<p><em>Suggestion for all of you:</em> if you've never played a game where the PCs have kids, try it! We've all run a dozen games where people's parents are the source of story ("Luke, I am your father" etc.) - but kids are a whole different source of story meat.</p>
<p>That said, another bang I had in our game was that the Emperor decided to marry Frost Morning Moon's young daughter (this was engineered by his First Wife as a way of gaining control over Frost Morning Moon without allowing her directly into the Imperial family). I thought this was a very cool idea but it might have put too much agency into NPC hands. You need to keep the story about the PCs.</p>
<p><em>An observation:</em>  This just applies to the Sorcerer games described here - Jess' wuxia general and Brand's punk rock Sorcerer - but I can't help notice that, for a Sorcerer game, demons don't play an awful big role in many of the bangs getting suggested. In a situation as fraught with human drama as Frost Morning Moon's, or Tommy &amp; Co. (it's an excellent kicker, Brand - so tightly twisted that further bangs seem almost redundant for the first session or two), you almost don't need the demons to drive everyone into blood and drama and fun. Still, part of playing Sorcerer, surely, is that you WANT demons to be causing trouble and mixing shit up. Tommy and Frost Morning Moon both have non-speaking object demons - anyone have any thoughts on how you can get non-speaking demons directly involved in the action and not have them totally overshadowed by all the human drama?</p>
<p>Sorry, long post. I'll try and come back with some bangs for the other kickers here before too long.</p>

                            Rob, <br/><br/>That's a very solid definition for humanity in the game! It would also most certainly change the way I ran things, and the kinds of bangs I'd generate. For the Emperor confessing his love in that game I probably would not run it like a Dogs NPC, heart on sleeve and everything. I would, however, fill the scenes with tense silence in which I say things like "The way he is looking at you, it is obvious there is so much more he wants to say but cannot..." Make it a constant temptation for her to lose humanity. Not to mention all those schemeing wives just waiting to pounce on weekness, blowing the least inflection of the voice all into proportion.<br/><br/>I know how you feel with the acting issue, as I'm nowhere near the actor that many of my group are -- especially Mo. (She's an immersionist and has 5 years of stage acting and weekly improv and soap experience, how the hell am I supposed to compete with that?) I normally compensate for it by using my words. I can't act all that well, but I can narrate very well indeed. So when I can't quite make the longing but repressed look come out on my face, I describe it as delicatly and poetically (or as full of blood and thunder, depending) as possible. I have another friend who is an artist, and he often draws out lots of pictures and scenes, and describes things how they'd be framed in a graphic novel. Mostly I think it's a matter of playing to your personal strengths. <br/><br/>Also, I highly second the suggestion to run games in which the PCs have kids. The Heroquest game I ran with my mother in law ended up having 90% of the action occur because of her adopted child and her burried child. It gives a combination of gut-punch and soft and sweet like little else. <br/><br/>Of course, if her bravest captain is her son, that just makes me want to say that its her son that is found raping a village girl. How's she gonna deal with that? Especially when her fell weapon starts whispering betrayal from her own womb? <br/><br/>And again, the need for many bangs. Some just don't take up a lot of time. In the example of the barbarian, all the cleaving can certainly be character revealing, and can lead to more stuff down the line. When Mr. Dead Barbarian's tribe now has a blood feud instead of a peace, it could lead to interesting stuff. However, that also may not happen if the PC then does something to send them howling back to the hills. So having your bandolier fully stocked is neccisary. <br/><br/>As for Demons in Sorcerer, you have found my biggest weakness as a Sorcerer GM! I often have difficulty with demons at the start of the game. They tend to play a bigger roll later on, once I have a sense of the characters sins for me to exploit. Ron would probably tell me off for that, so more demon bangs early on is probably a good thing. <br/><br/>Working them in is, I think, a matter of using their need vs. the needs of the PC. Tommy, for example, needs money and fame like a drug. His guitar can give that to him, but only if he gives it human misery. So if in the middle of the battle of the bands down at the Jersey Shore a bandmate starts hitting on Jeter and Tommy tries to mollycoddel the situtation and keep both his friend and his bandmate -- his guitar will make it obvious he's going to be abandoned at a key moment in the performance. No more magic fingers, Mr. Tommy. Similar deal with the fell weapon -- when its starting to be obvious that something is going to go to easily, to sweetly, without filling the weapon's need, then BOOM. <br/><br/>Hrmm... its occuring to me that I may play my demons as too reactive. Bangs require some active step, usually, and my demons always wait around for the PC to do something. Probably best to shake that up. <br/><br/>Finally, on the issue of bangs being redunant with Tommy's kicker -- maybe. Thing is you never know. I actually used Tommy because I got to play him in a one shot a few months back (after much whining on my part) -- and the whole main thrust of the kicker got resolved pretty quickly. Luckily the GM had some bangs about neighbors calling the cops, the cops calling the mob, the dad showing up to bail Jeter out and Jeter going all Shawshank, and so on. Unfortunatly we never got around to the band, so I find the band-based bangs fascinating because they open up a whole different way the character, and game, could have gone.                        </div>
