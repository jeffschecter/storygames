Most of that mulch is not in play right here and now, and if there are no brewers in the party, who cares what the brewing rules might be? What was that about consistency hobgoblins, again?<br/><br/>Applying this attitude to wargamey "real fiction" D&amp;D specifically, I have actually settled on a two-tiered mechanical systemization: there is the "0th level rules chassis" that deals with everything <i>real</i>, and then there's the "adventurer rules" that deal with what ultimately amounts to a set of dramatic exceptions and privileges. Most of what y'all think of as the D&amp;D rules are part of the "adventurer rules" tier, and should not be thought of in terms of realistic systematics: hit points are dramatic exceptions we grant to named characters, classes are narrative archetypes, thief skills are supernatural in the sense of not being able to withstand realistic scrutiny, even the fighter swinging his sword is often out-of-bounds...<br/><br/>Traditional treatments are, of course, thoroughly confused in this regard; they're just piles of subsystems that you're supposed to stitch together until you're comfortable. That's why there's generally speaking little consistency in D&amp;D if you just take the books at face value. It's best to not try to make any sense of how a "veteran soldier" and "eager farmboy" both have the same exact to-hit with a sword, for instance.<br/><br/>I'm explaining about my home system because I think that I've got a pretty good handle on the exception-based design problem that you have here. The way a "brewer's privilege" like that works in my systematics is always the same whether we're talking of a thief's climbing skills or a cook's cooking skills: there is a separate "how likely is a real person to actually accomplish this thing" rules layer and a separate "oh, I guess this character has dramatic exception" rules layer. The simple and classical case of doing things like this is perhaps the oldest fix to the shitty skill rules in D&amp;D: when a Thief tries to Climb, they should get to try <i>both</i> their thief skill and whatever other system you allow other characters to have. This way the Thief will always be strictly better at it, but the others also get a fair chance when the climb's an easy one.<br/><br/>(The original necessity for this layered approach was because the original D&amp;D skill rules are, indeed, rather shitty: your typical Thief would have completely useless skill ratings for many of their skills because of the way level inflation was perceived at the time. The only way for a Thief to actually be better than other characters at being a Thief was to allow them to use their skills on top of everyman's privilege in some way. This was particularly glaring for I think Move Quietly, I think; most GMs would allow any character a chance to at least try to sneak, while the Thief had it on black and white that their probability for success in that endeavour was in the sub-10% range...)<br/><br/>Putting that together, here's how my game would handle this "brewing feat": every character has a wilderness survival skill (sometimes at non-existent levels due to lack of common sense) that they can use to try to purify water. However, if some weird player wanted their character to be a "master brewer" the same way a traditional Thief is the "master climber" - that is, they want to make it a real mechanical specialization - then they get to have that, with whatever mechanics are appropriate. Automatic success or a bonus die or add your level to the roll or whatever. This does not simulate "being a brewer" or "having brewing skills" or anything like that; it's just the player's choice to have their character be dramatically more reliable than the next guy at brewing. It is precisely as justified in-fiction as a Fighter being better at fighting than the other guy with the identical background but no Fighter class features. A Fighter gets to be a Fighter without having an in-fiction background as a soldier, so I don't see why a Brewer couldn't be a Brewer without having the underlying real skills. Let the player be consistent if they want to.<br/><br/>Looking at what you arrived at, it's sort of similar: you ended up establishing a rule for "normal people" who try to do the thing in question, with the specialist crunch coming on top of that. The penalty/bonus dice paradigm is mechanically flexible enough that you could probably run modern D&amp;D rules chassis entirely on that. How about this for an universal rule:<br/><br/><b>Everybody can always try to do anything that makes sense in the fiction. If the only rules available for doing it involve a feat or class feature or other exclusive mechanical features, you can still do it, you just take a penalty die. One penalty die per piece of missing crunch, so if "attacking from horseback" requires the "Horse riding feat" and "Attack from the saddle" feat, an everyman takes two penalty dice to try it. (If that seems too hard, well, you're the one choosing to use stupid feats like that in your game.) If the activity does not involve rolling, roll your penalty dice anyway: low roll (50%) on any die fails.</b><br/><br/>I have much more experience with 3rd edition D&amp;D than 5th, but I could see myself using something like that if I was trying to run a fiction-based game with it - the game does have some pretty stupid feat- and skill-based thinking here and there. Plus, think of how much cooler a 3rd edition combat would be if your Fighter could potentially access <i>every combat feat in the book</i> when the need comes by accepting penalty dice to their attack rolls [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473645/#Comment_473645" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T17:11:39+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  5:11PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u3086\u304d\u307f\u3061, Eero... great posts\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It's best to not try to make any sense of how a "veteran soldier" and "eager farmboy" both have the same exact to-hit with a sword, for instance.</p></div></blockquote>\nWedge vs Luke\u2665\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If the only rules available for doing it involve a feat or class feature or other exclusive mechanical features, you can still do it, you just take a penalty die.</p></div></blockquote>\nYeah, that's exactly what we did \u2014 the prob is that then we need to learn all of the feats!

Like, these are the two possible situations that pertain to every single feat in the game (and out of it, too - you could use homebrew feats or whatever):<br/><br/><b>a)</b> You're aware of the feat and the rules it has. Therefore, when the situation comes up in the game where the feat pertains, you can choose to either use your generic resolution systems, or the one in the feat. Any character can use either system if you've decided that all feat-specific rules are accessible when necessary with a penalty die.<br/><br/><b>b)</b> There's an obscure feat for this situation in some rulebook, but nobody at the table knows it. You do have a perfectly serviceable generic resolution procedure for these situations, though, so you just do that. You may discover the feat later, in which case the next time the situation comes up you'll be in situation 'a' instead.<br/><br/>As far as I can see, situation 'b' is not a problem for the game and gameplay. It's not worse play than 'a'. There's no need to learn the game's entire feat library to be able to run mounted combat or something like that; it's strictly a bonus feature if some feats happen to exist that you like and want to rely on.<br/><br/>As you might know, my own main rules set is aggressively oral in nature - the game has a feat list, but it lives only in the grey matter of a half dozen people. Perhaps for this reason I don't see it as such a big deal if the feat list happens to have some half-assed idea in it from way back - it is easy to ignore it if we want to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473648/#Comment_473648" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T17:26:42+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  5:26PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2018 5:27PM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a perfect way to think of it!<br/>Actually that's why I was drowning in GURPS, it all the time threw me things that I thought I could resolve with the universal resolution thing but then had some super complicated rule with square roots and stuff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473649/#Comment_473649" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T17:31:06+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  5:31PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More thinking on the "all feat-based privileges are always accessible with a penalty die" thing...<br/><br/><b>Language feats:</b> A feat like "your character knows an extra language" defaults to the everyman rule "you can try to talk to people you share no common language with, but you take a penalty die to your diplomacy checks and such." Seems legit to me.<br/><br/><b>Weapon expertise feats:</b> The piddly +1s and +2s you gain from these feats are never going to be useful for a character who'd take a whopping penalty die to hit to access them. So this works, only the characters who actually pick the feat get the bonus.<br/><br/><b>Arms proficiency:</b> Your character can use armor they're not trained for, but the enemy gets a bonus die against them - again, seems legit. You can also use exotic ninja weapons without having a feat for it, but with a penalty die. The game has special case rules for these types of feats anyway.<br/><br/><b>Spell-casting feats:</b> There's probably a feat out there that enables a non-caster to cast some piddly 1st level spell once a day anyway. We could say that this isn't allowed without the feat because it's not something "anybody could try", but I don't see why not - sure, everybody gets to try that. Doesn't unbalance anything that I can see.<br/><br/>Feat rules in D&amp;D are rather disappointing anyway; the places where a feat actually amounts to anything except a petty little points-chasing game for geeky players aren't that many. It wouldn't surprise me if little changes about the game's overall structure with a feat treatment like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473650/#Comment_473650" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T18:01:53+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  6:01PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The counterpoint to this\u2014raised in the other thread\u2014is \u201cwhy are spells different\u201d and reading it I have thought a little about my approach to this which I think has taken an alternate-direction viewpoint on this.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is quite un-OSR of me. But I increasingly want to describe spells as specifically being secret, exclusive knowledge. And so when players ask about purifying water or making something blow up, I have an easy answer: that sounds like magic doesn't it?<br/><br/>So uh yeah you need a cleric to purify water. Some clerics are brewers? Like actual monks yup checks out.<br/><br/>Part of this is me thinking about roles in this kind of play\u2014that the players are there in part to introduce absurdity and anachronism into the setting that I have a specific tonal goal for, and one of my jobs is to reinscribe their silliness into the aesthetics of the setting. And this is one of the lines I have there.<br/><br/>Following from this: if a player is proposing a new spell that *isn't* secret knowledge or something, but just a shortcut to something that we can roll for, let's leave that to be played out. I've let a few too many of these past already tbh, mostly from various AD&amp;D derivatives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473651/#Comment_473651" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T18:04:55+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  6:04PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting counterpoint but how do you solve it in practice?

Same as climbing or hitting things with a sword.)<br/><br/>I just wrote up a little system for herbalism a week back that I'm pretty happy with, for example: it's a system that allows access to 1st level spells to characters with herbalistic skills and dedication, cross-class. Obviously there are differences (like your "Cure Minor" is a salve instead of a chant), but nothing so major as to make me say that a "spell" couldn't be non-magical. I wouldn't hesitate to use spell-based herbalism in a campaign that wanted to be dramatic (and rather unrealistic) about the miraculous possibilities of natural alchemy.<br/><br/>The fundamental difference between magic and non-magic, though, is setting-based, isn't it? I mean, if my setting didn't have pre-packaged spells, then it wouldn't have a somewhat traditional D&amp;D magic system. The answer to why spells are different is that they just are - the slot spell system is a powerful and flavourful way to handle the literary idea of "magic", so why not have that instead of something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473654/#Comment_473654" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T18:14:49+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  6:14PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            they can have scrolls\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473657/#Comment_473657" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T18:16:51+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  6:16PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, if your setting has them.

With their dinky lil mess kits that hold a mere \u215b of their daily water needs when full, let alone when given some margin for boiling over etc. And then I stumbled over proficiency with Brewer's Kit which did allow people to purify water -- at a very constricted rate.<br/><br/>And I tossed it back to the group, like "whatever we come up with for 'anyone trying it' should be weaker than what it is for that feat". And they did come up with a good houserule that had everyone going "yes!". But.This sorta thing makes me paranoid that I'm missing stuff. Now if they want to build a raft I need to check if there is some shipbuilder's proficiency that they don't outperform etc etc.<br/><br/>5e has a couple of other well-known probs like this: the grappling feat which is useless because tripping the grapplee to impose prone, which everyone can do, has the same ease and the same consequence. And the "Know your enemy" battlemaster ribbon that allows you to ask questions about someone's ac, hp or similar. If you stare at them for a minute. Well, that's pretty narrow since once you actually start the fight, I give out its ac and hp right away. It's just a ribbon though, it's ok if it's weak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473780/#Comment_473780" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T08:26:08+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  8:26AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I consider you the resident OSR guru, <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>.

The GM evaluates it for the following points:<br/><b>1)</b> Is this an automatic success or failure on the basis of the nature of the task and the assumed baseline performance capabilities of the character? Are we tying our shoes here, or trying to fly by flapping our arms?<br/><b>2)</b> Assuming that a resolution process is necessary, determine the skills and abilities that play into the roll.<br/><b>3)</b> Determine the DC of the roll.<br/><b>4)</b> Return the issue to the players for determining whether they want to go ahead and try the roll.<br/><br/>The above is the default procedure, so it would be what we do every time unless an <i>exceptions-based rule</i> interferes somehow. Typical case would be when a player character has some sort of privileged mechanical benefits. "I have the Brewing feat, so I get a bonus die for trying to brew water using my distilling kit" or "I have the Brewing feat, so I am assumed to succeed automatically in brewing water." Whatever.<br/><br/>If we find in actual play that some character has a feat that is too strong or too weak to properly capture the fictional idea that it tries for, then we fix the feat. This could be the case when the universal resolution procedure actually makes something easier than doing the same thing through a feat would be. For instance, if you've got a feat that gives you a 25% chance of walking a rope, but we discover that the ordinary task-resolution math almost always gives you more than that for a character with the same Dexterity score, then we clearly need to either improve that rope-walking feat or remove it. Same for it a feat proves too strong.<br/><br/>As you can see, the procedural issue is crazy simple for me because I always go [fiction]-&gt;[universal resolution]-&gt;[exceptions]-&gt;[result]. Sandra's problem with feats does not exist for me because I don't have a need to balance the universal resolution procedure against the feats, which is what Sandra's trying to do: for her, the feats exist first, and insofar as an universal default resolution procedure even exists, it only does so at the whim of the feats list. For me the feats are just this crazy grab-bag of arbitrary lego pieces that we can add to or take away from in the service of the substantial scenario.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473782/#Comment_473782" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T08:35:34+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  8:35AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2018 8:36AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great summary of my position\u2665<br/>(I.o.w. that I deliberately stay away from a universal resolution procedure and instead have a mish-mash of various specific resolution procedures.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473784/#Comment_473784" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T09:05:35+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  9:05AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This feats issue bears some resemblance to the orthodox traditionalist issue of "having to make the rules work": given that you want to play wargamey D&amp;D, but you're also committed to using the RAW, what do you do when the rules suck? It's a problem that isn't even a blip on the radar for somebody who's willing to engage in revision, but if your creative priority is respecting the ancients (for nostalgia reasons or whatever - I don't dispute the aesthetics) then you're in a pickle.<br/><br/>For example, what do you do if somebody tries to assassinate a high-level character with a carefully placed, stealthy arrow shot, or a dagger cut in their sleep? (Stealthy poisoning is not an issue in this regard, there's saving throws for that.) It is entirely possible for old D&amp;D RAW to come into an irreconcilable conflict with its own procedures when you happen to step into one of these soft spots in the systematics. (Specifically, the conflict here is between the expectation that "it should be possible" and the very clear, precise rules that tell you that it is impossible to assassinate somebody with two-digit hit point count without using magic.)<br/><br/>For a GM willing to engage in what I think is the intended form of the game, with rulings and constant rules-revision, the above paradox is not a difficult one - or really a paradox at all, as it is obvious that the posited scenario requires rules innovation. For a GM committed to textual solutions, however, it can lead to major difficulty in play, as they are likely to insist that "an attack is an attack" and should follow the combat rules. They are then forced to stand on a formalism in their ruling rather than justifying themselves on real grounds, as the combat rules bear no resemblance to the actual situation the group is trying to resolve.<br/><br/>(Not a theoretical exercise, by the way: I have been the player trying to do covert assassinations in D&amp;D multiple times with GMs who've insisted that catching the enemy unaware and having all the time in the world to prepare for my attack does not actually grant me any sort of mechanical combat advantage - you makes your attack roll and you takes what it gives you, no matter the fictional positioning. I disagree with the procedure personally, but more importantly, it is clearly uncomfortable for everybody at a table to be faced with these problematic parts of the game's rules.)<br/><br/>So anyway, just a thought - Sandra's feat problems seem similar to these types of problems in rules conservatism in that both types of issues have their proximate cause in the desire to respect the RAW and adapt the game to it, rather than the opposite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473785/#Comment_473785" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T09:08:58+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  9:08AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For example, what do you do if somebody tries to assassinate a high-level character with a carefully placed, stealthy arrow shot</p></div></blockquote><p><a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/arrow_threat/" rel="nofollow">5e house rule: Arrow threat</a></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>or a dagger cut in their sleep?</p></div></blockquote><p><a href="https://open5e.com/gameplay-mechanics/conditions.html#unconscious" rel="nofollow">Unconscious condition</a></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473786/#Comment_473786" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T09:19:02+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  9:19AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2018 9:19AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed - that particular rules hole is well and thoroughly plugged in many D&amp;D editions.

The gunlugger doesn't have the permission to roll +weird that the Hocus does. There are a whole lot of interesting ways you could approach the situation. Maybe he rolls +hot to Manipulate them. Or maybe he gets them into a frenzy but he has to Do Something Under Fire because they're dangerous to others or to him.

That doesn't necessarily kill all the microbes in it. Roll the d20 and find out what happens. You've extensively praised the gloracular d20,<br/> and here's a perfect opportunity to show it off.

These include:<br/><br/>1. Binary pass/fail. Really not that interesting. "Do I do _____?" is far less interesting than "How do I _____?"<br/><br/>2. Trinary PbtA-style resolution with a single d20 roll. Doesn't work that well in the d20 system, in my opinion. The flat percentage chances don't play well with 5e's math. The probability curve generated by multi-dice resolution systems work better than the flat spread of the d20. Either I am forced to greatly widen the spread of the partial success (e.g., DC 15 for a hit, DC 25 for a strong hit) or the partial success doesn't come up. Dislike.<br/><br/>3. Trinary resolution with 2d20. Works better than the above, still not my favorite. Sometimes the results are cascading dice rolls and excessive calculations in a way I don't much care for. (Roll 1d20+X twice for this, oh, but now there's a new danger present, so you're going to have to roll 1d20+Y twice...) Would work better if 5e prioritized conflict resolution over task resolution.<br/><br/>This leads me to "say yes and roll the dice." Most times, if an outcome is uncertain, I ask clarifying questions or tell the players what they'll need to do to accomplish something. "How do you do that?" works wonders. If an answer is insufficient to appease the Almighty GM, I make further demands of the player. For instance, "I want to talk the zookeeper into freeing the apes" this last session eventually morphed into one of the players going over the zookeeper's accounting books to demonstrate loss of revenue from the ape exhibit (long story behind that one). If an answer is sufficient, I'll usually let it go without a roll, unless there's a very clear partial success scenario or opportunity for danger to rear its head. At this point, the skill check serves as a sort of "saving throw" against the partial success/danger.<br/><br/>The results of this process are binary, but they are oddly satisfying. This has also kept rolling for mundane tasks limited. I am fairly pleased with this because it has multiple benefits: securing player agency, maintaining "bounded accuracy," and demanding creativity from both players and myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474128/#Comment_474128" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-22T20:36:47+00:00" title="May 22, 2018  8:36PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like an excellent technique.

The rule or practice of "say yes or roll" definitely doesn't apply to all games, but the spirit of it that transcends the specific rule or practice is largely that everyone benefits if you <i>allow things to happen</i>. Unless! Unless a failure or success-with-a-complication could be at least as interesting as perfect success. I'm not sure I've played a game in which failure meant a dead end since maybe the mid-90's.<br/><br/>I'll note that sometimes it feels like you need to push success-with-a-complication simply because you can imagine reasonable problems/dangers; BUT, sometimes, even if those complications readily come to mind, it can easily be best simply to allow full success without a roll. Or as the opening to a deal:<br/>"Sure, it works, don't even roll. But if you X, then Y is going to happen and you're going to have to deal with that."<br/>Which opens the door to a player response: "What if I also Z as a precaution?"<br/>"You're proficient. You know it'll work. But you'll have to roll for <i>that</i>."<br/><br/>An open dialogue like that, in my experience, almost always increases player engagement - not just with the game in general, but the specific fiction. They find greater interest in positioning/how they do things, which circles back around to making things easier on the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474137/#Comment_474137" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-23T14:53:54+00:00" title="May 23, 2018  2:53PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That sounds like an excellent technique.

Certain skill checks such as sneaking or hiding use the more traditional system as that provides an element of drama within the task itself. Combat still uses the core engine relatively unaltered (because why play D&amp;D if you're not using the combat rules). The aesthetics of the system are imperfect, but it integrates fairly seamlessly into the D&amp;D rules as-written with binary success/failure and variable DCs.<br/><br/>This resolution system is pleasing to those involved because it allows the players to focus on what their characters are doing in the fiction rather than higher-level concerns about conflict. In some systems, breaking away from the fiction to use conflict resolution systems (like the Duel of Wits) has proved unsatisfying for my group.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">@Paul_D_L</a>: I agree completely with what you've said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474140/#Comment_474140" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-23T16:39:30+00:00" title="May 23, 2018  4:39PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a similar note, I'm toying with the idea of Otherkinding D&amp;D (its because I really want to run D&amp;Dish looking things but I'm always dissatisfied with my options - 5E, OSR &amp; DW included).<br/><br/>So you roll a couple of d20 every turn and distribute it to:<br/>1. actions (attack &amp; defense rolls (player facing), changing initiative or saving throws)<br/>2. narration rights over interpreting the rolls (this is where it gets interesting and connects to VSK's post).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474142/#Comment_474142" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-24T04:37:23+00:00" title="May 24, 2018  4:37AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a> Otherkinding D&amp;D?

That's brilliant. I think often I do that, in practice, but I've never articulated it that clearly.<br/><br/>2) 5E-mechanics-specific advice to Sandra's OP: I think the question you need to ask yourself, whenever people are doing something that you're not sure if there's a specific rule for (but that you'd rather not retroactively invalidate), is, "Is there tool use involved?"<br/><br/>Or, to be more specific, a three-step procedure:<br/><br/>1) Does what the PCs are doing fall under one of the Skills? If so, you know what to do. (Even if no one in the party happens to be trained in that Skill, no worries: the point is that the rules are clear.)<br/><br/>2) If <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> returns a "no," then ask, "Does what they're doing involve tool use?" If so, then they only get proficiency on the roll if someone has the appropriate tool proficiency.<br/><br/>3) If <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> returns a "no," then it's probably a straight stat test.<br/><br/>I thought of the above when you asked about building a raft. I've definitely encountered situations in the game where I've asked, "Does anyone have a tool proficiency relevant to this situation?" That way, I don't have to have the entire list of tools memorized, I just have a simple heuristic to follow to avoid the problem you're describing, of accidentally skipping something there's a rule for.<br/><br/>I also strongly agree that sometimes in 5E, proficiency in something (whether skill or tool) should be enough to simply obviate the need to roll. Much like Backgrounds' special abilities, in fact: Any PC who wants to could roll an appropriate social skill to find somewhere to do a musical performance, whereas Entertainers generally don't need to roll to do the same, except in extreme circumstances. Same thing with "crashing on a peasant's couch" and Folk Heroes.<br/><br/><i>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</i> explains tool use much better than the core book, BTW, so def check that out if you haven't already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474405/#Comment_474405" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-02T21:59:58+00:00" title="June  2, 2018  9:59PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>2. Trinary PbtA-style resolution with a single d20 roll. Doesn't work that well in the d20 system, in my opinion. The flat percentage chances don't play well with 5e's math. The probability curve generated by multi-dice resolution systems work better than the flat spread of the d20. Either I am forced to greatly widen the spread of the partial success (e.g., DC 15 for a hit, DC 25 for a strong hit) or the partial success doesn't come up.</p></div></blockquote>\nOn a +0, +1, or +2 on 2d6 you have a little over 40% chance of hitting a 7-9 result.
