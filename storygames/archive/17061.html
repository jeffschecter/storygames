About once a year, I decide this is the year I'll learn to love 3rd edition D&amp;D, and since I got a lot of pathfinder stuff from various people for free, I usually use that. So, we spent a few days making characters, and we started and we got to the first combat with goblins in the dungeon. Basically, people moved into position, and then just rolled dice at each other and nothing was happening I was really bored. So I took fifteen minutes to print out my Dungeon World stuff, everybody made their character in five minutes, and then we were off.<br/><br/>One of the things I did in that session was when one of the characters failed a roll to cast a spell, I turned them into a toad. When they tried to fix it, they turned into a duck. I treated this more as a minor inconvience than anything else, but I like how moves let spells have crazy misfire effects without a table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387444/#Comment_387444" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T21:56:11+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  9:56PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This: <br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13777/dungeon-world-apoc-dd-dingledales-finest/p1" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13777/dungeon-world-apoc-dd-dingledales-finest/p1</a><br/>Best game ever <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387461/#Comment_387461" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-19T02:31:46+00:00" title="August 19, 2012  2:31AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks both of you !<br/><br/>Noofy: i will come back to you once i've read the entire post carefully<br/><br/>Captain_thark:<br/><br/>So, what about your players ? Do they (and you) still play pathfinder ? (Were they "traditonnal" rpg gamer ? )<br/>And how was the DW game apart from that anecdote ? What made it really different form pathfinder, and great experience ? Any more scene as exemple ? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
