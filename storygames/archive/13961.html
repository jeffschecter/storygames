I've been developing this for a while, and I'm really happy to be able to share it with the world.  Mud Dragon is a game about stupid little dragons having stupid little adventures, in the spirit of Great Ork Gods and Kobolds Ate My Baby! Marvel as the Mud Dragons struggle to overcome their own incompetence to steal candy from a baby, organize a farting contest, or kidnap a princess! The game is easy to set up, takes only about an hour to play, and is perfect for casual gameplay or when you're waiting for that one late player to show up.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/garbagecanraiders.gif"/><br/><br/>The book is 38 pages long, beautifully illustrated by Kevin Moore, and available for $15. Please note that it's presently at the printer's, so if you order the hardcopy it won't arrive until early April.<br/><br/>The ebook is available for a sliding scale price: pay what you can afford. If I were to fix a price for it it would probably be $7, but you can pay any amount you want. If you'd rather pay nothing at all (or if you'd pay less than a dollar), please just write to me at taogames@gmail.com and I'll set you up.<br/><br/>Since paypal doesn't seem to be agreeing with this site right now, order <a href="http://bit.ly/fxjBIo" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to sharing this game with you all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
