PAX, a convention known around these circles as well, is apparently starting tonight. If anybody's going and would like to <a href="https://villages.cc/posts/240/" rel="nofollow">get me some League of Legends skin cards</a> as free swag from the Riot Games booth, I'll acknowledge an hour per card for the trouble. Of course if you just happen to have some unused skin cards lying around, PAX or not, I'm interested.<br/><br/>If others have similar desires related to convention loot, feel free to post about it here. I'm obviously not going to PAX myself, but perhaps we'll catch some helpful PAX-goers here. It'd make sense that people are only leaving for the convention on Friday, maybe. Should have thought about this earlier, but I realized my brother's LoL skin fetish just now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
