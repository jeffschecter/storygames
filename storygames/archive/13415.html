Figure out how these NPCs will approach the PCs and entangle them into their plots. Invent other ways to entangle the various PCs and compromise their neutrality; your job is to entangle the player characters so that they feel obligated and motivated to resolve the irresolvable conflicts your scenario presents. The golden treasure of the deceased miner, the prostitute with the heart of gold, the golden religious truths of the PC preacher, the man with the golden gun (OK, got carried away with the theme there) are all pre-created for the purpose of engaging the characters with your scenario, which always has human interests at stake. Bonus points for customizing your entanglements (Bangs) with the individual characters in mind, although this is not necessary in Dust Devils; your basic drifting gunman will run quite fine as long as you give him a vulnerable woman to protect, a jerk sheriff to flip off and an evil cattle baron to confront. Just make sure all your NPCs are involved in interesting and morally grey ways so the scenario has exciting revelations that cast new light on the matters at suitable moments, and thus keeps the players chewing.<br/><br/>Conflicts usually last 5-15 minutes, although a conflict might get delayed and span a much longer time when the players play a tight game and <i>fold</i> often. It's imperative to understand the idea that all conflicts can have very serious consequences, and a player who plays a hand, especially a strong hand, is taking artistic responsibility for the carnage that follows: there is no such thing as a non-damaging conflict in DD, and thus the folding rules are rather important; the smart player plays tight, bluffs and only lays down his cards when he has the winning hand and he's willing to shoulder the responsibility of fucking up the other guy beyond all recognition. The game is usually relatively short for characters that are not played like this. (Nothing wrong with that, of course.)<br/><br/>Speaking of folding, learn to think of conflicts not in terms of resolution, but in terms of tension: Dust Devils runs much smoother if the Dealer is conversant with the idea that a conflict can be even more exciting if it ends inconclusively and the conflicting parties live to face each other anew another day over the same matter. I say this because most conflict-focused games do not have such a central mechanic for delaying conflict resolution, and consequently many GMs are instinctively too resolution-centric; embrace and enjoy the fact that you can throw a couple of characters face-first into a conflict situation and then have both back down because the moment (cards, rather) was not right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302433/#Comment_302433" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T13:57:25+00:00" title="November 27, 2010  1:57PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey thanks Eero!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302624/#Comment_302624" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T14:00:19+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  2:00PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's advice is great.
