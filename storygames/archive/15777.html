Battles can take a long time, but Agon can certainly be played so that character is what you are on the battlefield.  There is lots of dice rolling, but not rolling to hit/rolling for damage.  Attackers and defenders roll at the same time; if the attacker\u2019s result is higher, and the defender then fails an armor check, the defender is wounded.  Six wounds and the opponent is defeated!<br/><br/>Burning Wheel:  BW\u2019s Fight and Range &amp; Cover rules would likely provide deep tactical combats.  These combats may take too long for your group, at 7-8 players\u2014unless, perhaps, their characters are fighting each other.   Combats can be conducted quickly in BW by avoiding the Fight and Range &amp; Cover rules.  Instead, the Bloody Versus rules, in which characters build dice pools and then divide the dice between offense and defense\u2014a tactical decision if ever there was one\u2014provide a good compromise.  The size of the dice pool is partly based on things like armor, weapon reach, physical characteristics of the combatants, the geography of the battlefield, and other factors that savvy players will look to maximize.  The battle is won or lost before the dice are rolled in the creation of the dice pools and the decision on the offense/defense split.  A single set of dice rolls (offense/defense) by each combatant determines the victor.  <br/><br/>The One Ring:  I have just started playing TOR, but I think it lays in between BW (Bloody Versus) and Agon in terms of tactical complexity.  In combat, the player characters determine a battle stance.  This stance determines the target number both of the PC to hit the opponent, and the opponent to hit the PC [modified by armor].  On a hit, weapon damage is fixed\u2014although good dice rolls will increase that damage.  Monsters have special features powered by Hate, and the PCs have non-attack type options to do during the fight\u2014inspire others, defend others, etc.   Combatants can be defeated through either the gradual loss of endurance, or one or two very effective blows.  The tactical decisions involve combat stances and the use of special actions, as well as balancing the amount of armor worn\u2014more armor means a better defense rating, but a lower endurance threshold.  <br/><br/>Bottom Line\u2014they\u2019re all worth trying!  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358020/#Comment_358020" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T10:12:40+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 10:12AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu Open Reloaded is something I remember being both tactical in its resolution and consistently satisfying fictionally, due to the fact that the 1st rule is essentially, "whatever the person says happens, happens," with 2 caveats: Other players can veto you, which sort of forces you to stay at least within genre, and you can't barrage the death of any important PC or NPC without first defeating them mechanically (in all other cases, you describe the fictional action and its results, THEN roll, which is actually pretty boss).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358021/#Comment_358021" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T10:18:01+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 10:18AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/" rel="nofollow">Anima Prime</a> is an awesome choice. It's tactical, while still feeling breezy and accessible. It's inspired by the Final Fantasy series and other JRPG ideas.<br/><br/><b>Cinematic Combat</b>: You spend turns doing <i>maneuvers</i> to accumulate dice before making a big <i>strike</i>. This leads to combats that involve lots of leaping from ledge to ledge, charging up your powerful soulbound weapons, planning ambushes, etc. Combat always feels dynamic and exciting.<br/><br/><b>Powers</b>: You have 10 powers. Some just boost a specific type of action (like giving you +2 to combined strikes), while others give you magical powers (like turning your missile-based attacks into fire-elemental attacks, or causing your fists to drain psychic energy from opponents). There are a list of "power kits" to pick from at the start of the game if you just want to get playing. You pick two "power kits" and combine them - boom, that's your 10 powers right there. Now you're an interdimensional soulwalker, or a steambound soldier.<br/><br/><b>"Cut Scene" Mentality</b>: Think like a video game. You've got a big, exciting fight. Then there are character cut-scenes. Whether they're flashbacks, tender confessions of inter-party love, or training montages... your cut scenes recharge your skills and abilities. Then, there's a scene where you're scouring the underside of the airship, looking for that one last rogue stowaway. But when you find him, gasp!, it's Luca Kane! How did he find you here? Didn't he die on the Bridge of Souls? Cue the fight scene music.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358033/#Comment_358033" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T10:47:07+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 10:47AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/index.html" rel="nofollow">3:16</a> works well for a large group and has some tactical goodness                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358039/#Comment_358039" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T11:05:51+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 11:05AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So yeah, what I'd go for here would be <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i>. Let me say that I expect that your antipathy towards traditionalism involves greater systemic issues than just the base fight mechanics, but even if we take that by face value, T&amp;T is just great for your purposes: it does not have the initiative -&gt; roll to hit -&gt; damage roll structure of D&amp;D, it doesn't primarily run off miniatures tactics (important if you want to stay away from the modern D&amp;D, Savage Worlds, etc. line of thinking), and I guess it is a "story game", if we understand that to mean a game where fictional positioning has massive, drastic consequence. It also takes up to 20 to 30 players after a bit of practice.<br/><br/>Specifically, I recommend T&amp;T because it is <i>tactical</i> in the sense of purposeful planning and action. It's not a drama game, a narrativist game, however one might phrase that - it's not about your own scene, it's about teamwork and using your imagination to overcome obstacles. Very tactical, with plenty of leeway for the players to hijack both the direction and narration of the events as long as they have a strong sense of the facts on the ground (fictional positioning) and their options (medieval fantasy commando tactics).<br/><br/>And yes, the combat system of the game is still one of the most radical out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358041/#Comment_358041" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T11:07:40+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 11:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seconding Anima Prime.

Only real problem may be the length of battles with 7-8 players.

I find that the cut scene mentality translates into "we'll advance character stories in little increments here and there, rather than trying to create non-stop character drama." So maybe you have two character scenes per session, and each is about 1-3 minutes long.<br/><br/>In the first one, you tell Squeaks (your childhood quasi-romantic best friend) that you can't stay on Dimville, and that he can't come with you. You walk away, a single tear streaming down your face. 2 minutes, something to keep the character interesting, but not something that requires much emotional investment for reals. In the second one, you are taking out your loneliness in a training montage, slashing sandbags at the edge of Fort Lightly. Two minutes of narration, and you're charged up and ready for battle again.<br/><br/>Certainly your character scenes could be much more involved than that, but I've played Anima Prime in the mode where we have cute, simple character cut scenes... and then segue right back into the crazy airship bat-monster fights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358072/#Comment_358072" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T14:02:43+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  2:02PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2012 2:04PM by FigureFour.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I'd recommend<i>Weapons of the Gods</i>, for a very large number of reasons, but the short version is that:</blockquote>\nI would recommend <i>Legends of the Wulin</i> for the same reasons, and because it's basically a cleaned up version of Weapons of the Gods.<br/><br/>Edit: Scratch that . . 7-8 players might get a little unwieldy for something like LotW.

If you don't mind the "fixer-upper" nature of Wick's other games (like, isn't Blood and Honor actually missing any kind of healing rules?), then have at it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358552/#Comment_358552" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T15:50:26+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  3:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've had lots of fun both with Agon and 3:16, if you're staying focused on story-gamey games.
