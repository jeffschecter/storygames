What are cool examples of doing this? Any interesting tricks?<br/><br/>* Prepping a Town<br/><br/>Do you work in some of the PCs' relationships, like take an NPC and make them so-and-so's mother? How do you choose when to do this to best effect? Or do you let the players decide? <br/><br/>What happens after you've been through a few Towns and all the relationships have already been "used". How can you (or should you) justify bringing those relations into the story again?<br/><br/>(Revisiting the same town sometime later sounds like a fun possibility...)<br/><br/>* Relationships to places<br/><br/>What are these good for? Are they useless once you move on to a different town? How do you leverage these for fun play?<br/><br/>Finally, the book kind of suggests that relationships are Flags, telling you things the players want conflicts to be about. But it doesn't then outright say, "go and do X", where X might be "include each relationship in your Town", or "to frame a significant conflict, choose a PC's relationship to a place, and set the action there".<br/><br/>EDIT: The thing that jumps out at me is that the text does NOT tell you to do any of the above. The reason that "sticks out" to my eye is because the rest of the text is SO good at telling you exactly what to do, how to do it, and when to do for best effect. So, I'm not sure if the text is missing something or if I'm missing something.<br/><br/>So, how do you use relationships to their best effect in Dogs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178076/#Comment_178076" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T14:48:29+00:00" title="November 10, 2008  2:48PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For most games I present the players with a list of NPCs to choose relationships with and encourage them to leave plenty of NPC dice unassigned. I found the best time to assign NPC dice is during a conflict, especially with that NPC. If you are having a conflict with an NPC, you are likely invested in them. Worst situation were when players assigned NPC dice upon meeting with an NPC without "getting to know them" and then regretting it later. Although I try to increase the importance of an NPC when players assign dice to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/warren" title="warren"><img alt="warren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wmerrifield.googlepages.com/GoPlayMario.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/warren">warren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178131/#Comment_178131" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T03:22:39+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  3:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a discussion about this recently <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25489.0" rel="nofollow">at the Lumpley Games forum of the Forge</a> that might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd personally, when prepping a town I mark certain of my NPCs as blood relations and let the players choose who before they enter the town. Like this: "OK, You are heading towards the Blackwater Hills Branch. One of you has a cousin in this town, and somebody else has an aunt.

It's much cooler to play out the scene from the Relationship with the Steward that helped you to learn how to break a mustang, than to just write 'Relationship, Steward, Father, 2d4'.<br/><br/>It also allows me to foreshadow stuff that is going to come up later on if need be.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178199/#Comment_178199" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T12:34:26+00:00" title="November 11, 2008 12:34PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great idea Indy Pete!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178374/#Comment_178374" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T13:17:04+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  1:17PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, great idea, indeed!<br/><br/>I've been doing some research, and thought I should post the results here:<br/><br/>The answer to all relationships-related questions can be found be searching for the word "relationships" in the lumpley games forum at the Forge.<br/><br/>It seems that Vincent's text for Dogs does leave a lot of people confused about what to do with relationships.
