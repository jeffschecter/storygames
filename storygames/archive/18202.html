Game play revolves around trying to preserve your Attachments (things you care about or want to accomplish with numbers that you can risk to do better mechanically) from exterior threats while doing as little damage to those threats as possible. Its supposed to drive home themes of balance as seen in films like Nausicaa and Mononke and Return of the Jedi. I want the GM, who spends a lot of time threatening the characters attachments to have a limited currency to work with that he uses to push against the PC's.<br/><br/>With that said, how do you think I can make this currency work? What kind of games do this already? What more would you need to know about the system to be able to offer advice, etc...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410818/#Comment_410818" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T03:53:55+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  3:53AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What happens when the currency runs out? How come players want to minimise damage to the threats? (Aside from their being good and kind hearted Ghibli heroes, I guess. So the question might really be how you make them into Ashitaka or Sofi or Nausica\xe4 or whoever &amp; encourage them to play those sorts of characters.)<br/><br/>The way things might work in Mononoke (themes of balance wise) is that every time the GM deploys a threat, they must also deploy a threat to their threat. Everything that threatens the heroes' pure and noble goals also threatens itself because it Disturbs The Balance. Not that disturbances don't represent threats to attachments in themselves. Taking the iron rouses the forest. Hunting the boar corrupts them into demons.<br/><br/>I'm guessin based on what you said so far though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410820/#Comment_410820" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T04:17:10+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  4:17AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doing harm, in short, basically cuts down on the amount of XP you earn. Players don't want to cause harm, from a mechanical perspective, because if they do they'll get less points, but they must act "against" the threat to protect their Attachments.<br/><br/>What you're saying here about threats acting against each other is interesting... Definitely something to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
