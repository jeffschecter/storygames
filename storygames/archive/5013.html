To do that I have to understand what you are after.<br/><br/>One thing is that in Sweden we obviously use larp in a quite different way than in US (and other places) and our experiences differ quite much. Reading thor's original post I get the impression that he is after a type of game that I wouldn't call larp (but I know that others would, and I don't have a problem with that). <br/><br/>Thor: "I want to do something larp-like on the tabletop" and mentions Jeepform. Other people seem to talk about traditional larp, though. My point is most definitely not to discuss terminology, but I just want to understand what thor is interested in. Is my impression correct in that you want to make some kind of game for 3-8 players (or so) which are played without a lot of props, in a room and probably with a GM (well, I know some people have GM:s in larps; I know for a fact that it might even work excellent with enough care taken.). If this is the case one idea might be to go to www.jeepform.org and read the following three scenarios: <i>Mothers</i>, <i>Baby steps</i> and <i>Doubt</i>. (The site claims that the English version of Mothers might not be up to par. I have only read the Danish original, (I love this part of Nordic cultural heritage) so I wouldn't know about that.)<br/><br/>Certainly there are a lot of other perspectives than those of the Jeepsters, (please help me find them!) but these three scenarios are among the most intriguing stuff I have seen. (Note:one exciting thing would be game designed for a similar type of play but geared towards campaign play.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>For a one shot LARP: Make a big character map. Write up backgrounds and motivations for each person in that map. Make sure that each of them has dynamic goals, short term (as in: right away) and long term (as in: when the initial situation changes, what can they improvise from.) Invent some half-assed conflict resolution and slap it on. Done.</blockquote>\nMany trad larps are made like this. For a conflict resolution I would recommend 'Don't bloc' and something about how to regular physical contact. (No contact rule should not even be considered if there is no specific point with it.). Thing is: It is very easy (too easy!) to create good larp play with engaged people. The perfect proof of this was a game that I believed was called 'The Dinner'. Perhaps we should call it a meme rather than a game. I think it originated in Norway, but it also got played in Sweden. In The Dinner there are names of the characters. Included in the game is also their famliy relations, like 'dad', 'son' and 'aunt' and so on. There is nothing more. There is no GM, there is no info. You just have a dinner without a single word out-of-character talk and you improvise everything else together.<br/><br/>The problem is that you often get great play by these type of games. But, of course, more closely inspected you get a rather shallow play.  You won't usually be able to address a premise in a proper way and you won't lean anything new about yourself. (I guess most people here have already gained this wisdom, although through a slightly different road.)<br/><br/>My own attempts on proper larp writing has basically been according to Lehman's formula, BTW. I would probably do it differently today, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113012/#Comment_113012" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T13:08:03+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  1:08PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>"You are all pigs.

But it is true that to people that have never played them they are often more easily accessible to larpers than to table top players.<br/><br/>And thanks for your comment, Ben. I don't know much about American larp, honestly. But I have tried to learn and I have - to my surprise - found nothing of the kind you are talking about in US. I have found some somewhat 'Nordic' larps in Britain (and Turkey!) and some games on the Australian (and perhaps the Israeli) scene that is a bit similar to Danish freeform. But nothing in US. But I guess people just don't write too much about it! You should! <br/><br/>One reason for the sometimes antagonistic relationship between jeep (and such things) and Nordic larp is the very strong impact of extreme immersionism in our larp tradition. Luckily this is becoming a bit diluted (in the arthaus, at least) these days. (Well, some of the jeepsters were organizing last year's Knutpunkt, so I guess the larp people have to accept them these days. The Norwegians quarreled on beforehand, but were happy in the end.) \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I don't think pigs have a lot to say.

It is more tabletop oriented, and definitely not LARP, but the games I have done before have a fairly strict one at a time scene flow and i want to learn techniques LARPers have found to get around this.<br/><br/>Initially I imagined a game that could be played on a model train set-up. With all of the players moving about simultaneously. There would be two or three stories going on at once. they could be subdivided so that the serious people were playing in one and the frivolus people were playing in another and only interacting when the needed each others resources. <br/><br/>I have come to think that this would be easier as a LARP.

It's a time-consuming process, but teaches a lot. Another way is to go out, play in a larp, and learn - what did you like, what you did not like, and what was an utter failure for you. There are plenty of very different larp-styles around, with very different techniques applied - again, with varying degrees of success.<br/><br/>If we skip all that, I don't think there's a lot of basic advice on how to write and run a larp available; most of the stuff in Knudepunkt-books, for example, are directed to some specific part of the process of creating a larp. That, and most of them have an expectation that the reader has a Nordic larping background (see the witty explanation by Matthjis).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thor</cite>Initially I imagined a game that could be played on a model train set-up.

The stories are kind of the fragile ground when it comes to larps, due to the de-centralized nature of larps. Tabletop gaming tends to be very centralized, as players are working as a group and that group is a nodal point for information. Larps can use the lack of that centralization either as an advantage or it can be a great disadvantage if you're not prepared for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113152/#Comment_113152" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T14:45:56+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  2:45PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2007 2:46PM by thor.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My original thoughts were for a game were you just kept on moving and interacting like a first person shooter but without all the guns.

In a sense, a larp without the physical side of things, except perhaps body language and such. So you kind of want to have the de-centralized structure of the larp, in which the players are able to act on their own, but don't want to (if you are sane, at least) do a full-larp-setup-with-real-village-and-hundred-players, right?<br/><br/>And if so, some questions and musings that come to mind:<br/><br/>What Ben said about the relationship maps; you'd want to front-load a lot of things and concentrate on stuff that players can handle between themselves, without the need for the GM's to step in. You (and possibly your fellow GM's) can't be everywhere at once and due to nature of de-centralized play, you can't keep a tab on everything that's happening. So that'd be the first learning point - creating characters in a way that makes them self-sufficent and able to act on their own and/or come up with stuff that players can handle on their own to keep the game going.<br/><br/>You probably want to simulate the physical setting in some way; different places in the village and what not. Players should not be lumped together, but should be able to enter different places or scenes, which is very challenging to do in one room. I think there was an excellent thread about using Dogville-kind of setup and other stage-stuff somewhere around here, but I can't find it. But setting up a playing space that would definately be another thing to think about.<br/><br/>Third thing would be the matter of content; how would you potray the crisis and tasks with the limited number of players you have at your disposal? In tabletop playing this would be the GM's duty, in whatever way the GM duties are spread in the group. In a larp this is more challenging because, like mentioned, it's de-centralized by nature. Normally you'd introduce crisis and tasks which only involve player characters, but then again, normally you'd probably have a village full of player characters, so this wouldn't be a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113221/#Comment_113221" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T03:29:01+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  3:29AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All that Merten said.<br/><br/>Also I think it might be a good idea to have one or two GM:s. The GM:s might be able to switch from playing characters to just act like GM:s, but it might be a good idea to have them quite much in their pure GM role. This would make it less larpish, but on the other hand probably better and you don't seem to be bound to the idea of trad larp.<br/><br/>It might be a bit hard to figure out how to use GM:s in this fashion if you have never seen that style of play and it might be hard for the players to get used to. The GM can quite effectively sculpt an on-going live game by giving just small input. He can inform the players about their characters' drive, remind them of memories or whatever. This requires of course that you are into transparent roleplay to a certain degree. You might not be and then you would have to go another way. (This is very Jeep) The most classical larp trick ever is otherwise to have 'GM roles', authoritative roles which have the possibility of controlling the game from within. Personally I don't like this too much, but it's still too useful a trick to throw away. <br/><br/>You should also think about what part of the game can be done by pure player versus player play and what requires a GM. Perhaps one of your in game locations can be left rather GM free during the game, (but prepped heavily on beforehand by information given to players) while on another location the players work against a GM and perhaps uses more game mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
