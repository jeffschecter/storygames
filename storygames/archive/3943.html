The board I post in loves GURPS, and while there's not a huge amount of hex-map and combat math going on, it doesn't quite work for me.  I like all the crunchiness of GURPS, but it seems like most of one's character sheet falls by the wayside once play begins.  I love Shadow of Yesterday, but it's tough finding converts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had some ideas to strengthen the bits of GURPS that I like, without really changing much.  I had hoped to show it off before trying to recruit for the idea I had (the players are half-demons on the run from their crazy families, their allies and enemies in the celestial hierarchy determine where the game would go).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we go, assuming a 150-point game:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Destiny, of both the good and bad variety</b> - you can take both, or several small doses.  You could take lots of the bad kind and play a tragic character, if you want.  Either way, the player can suggest something about its nature - this is worth more with more details: Minor, bad destiny is worth 3.  More details about it (it happens to my property, due to my enemies) is worth -4, (it happens to my pirate ship, due to Blackbeard) is worth -5.  The maximum Good and Bad Destiny both imply the 'end' of your character, either death or ascension (however that would makes sense in the story).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Vows</b> - Include detail!  Accomplishing Vows with a specific end-goal will be accomplished in the game.  They do not have to be complicated - they can be as simple as a Promise to check on someone you know in a distant town - but it is still, of course, a disadvantage, and you should argue its necessity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Duty</b> - This is specific duty, to a certain group, for characters who, by and large, autonomous.  This group will typically have standing orders for those with Duty to them, implying that the character ought to be doing stuff for them.  Depending on the level of the Duty, these will be easy or difficult (or both) tasks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Allies and Enemies are required.</b>  Spend at least 15 points on Allies (10% of the total CP limit), and get at least 15 points from taking Enemies (10% again).  Be sure that you can use Allies and can expect Enemies everywhere - they'll move around, just like you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Low-level Allies and Contacts</b> can be left unspecified (including relevant skill), except for their point value and point make-up (skill level, reliability).  If you are in a situation where a contact could really help you out, give the in-game details (who they are and what they do). Allies/Contacts that are 5 points or less don't need in-game specifics.  After such allies are paid for, you can drop them after the session, if you like, freeing up the points.  These kinds of allies probably remain stationary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Wealth Level</b> - This will be your arbitrary 'purse' that you carry around.  Rich characters are assumed to have bank notes, high-value coinage, or tradeable gems always available.  If the player wants to buy something, the player and GM decide whether their 'purse' will allow them to pay for it.  Typically, this is kind of a 'per diem' allowance - even if you're rich enough to buy a house, you couldn't buy two in the same week.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Signature Gear</b> - ALL starting gear is bought with Signature Gear.  Magic items are powered by 50 energy points per 1 CP - that's after you've paid for the item according to the spell's requirement according to $100 per CP, minimum 1 CP.  You automatically have clothes and personal basics and anything small like that - and probably items for each of the skills you're good at, too, as long as it's less than $100 (lockpicks or a shield, but not a sailboat).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Earning CP</b> - Acting according to a vow when it seriously disadvantages you earns you CP - a -10 (or larger) Vow gets you 2 CP, a -5 Vow gets you 1 CP.  This goes for other certain disadvantages, such as Pacifism and Sense of Duty.  Accomplishing the tasks given to you by your Duty earns you CP according to the level of the task.  Thwarting your enemies earns you CP according to the same level - escaping or killing an Enemy (or a named agent thereof) if he or she was immediately about to do you in, or obscuring your presence from an enemy Watcher, or publicly humiliating a Rival in a contest or goal you're both interested in, all earn CP.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than these, I would probably be pretty strict with Disadvantages (one or two outside of the ones listed above, and no overlap among the ones you have), since too many dilute their value to making the events interesting.  I was a little tempted to add a 'mental' fatigue that would allow 'extra mental effort' (as Fatigue allows for feats of Strength), but I hesitate to add too much, rather than just expanding on what's already there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do people think?  Would this make for something closer to a story-game, whatever that means?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88335/#Comment_88335" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T08:14:46+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  8:14AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I run GURPS as a story game pretty regular like, these seem pretty cool house rules for a particular campaign.

Instead of a long chain of skill rolls to succeed in a scene, we generally only use one or two.  So instead of multiple Climbing and Stealth and Acrobatics rolls to get inside an enemy castle, we'll just pick one skill, have the characters describe their approach, and roll, maybe with a bonus if their plan's really cool.<br><br>Whenever a roll occurs, I try to stay mindful of interesting consequences of failure.  Simple "you don't succeed" is boring.  If we need an OOC discussion to set up some interesting consequences, that's fine.  We don't fear the dirty metagaming.  We haven't formalized when this happens; sometimes it happens before the roll and sometimes afterwards.<br><br>I <b>love</b> to award CP for bad moments with disadvantages.  The worse the situation, the bigger the reward, and I'll bid it up if no one's biting.  ("Three character points if your character has an attack of Truthfulness while in negotiations with Tony Soprano!  Not interested?  How about four?  You could buy that Broadsword up to 18 with four CPs...")  My players are fiends for CPs and are happy to score them.  There's an unspoken thing there that says that I'm not going to totally hose the characters for a disadvantage buy, though.  And if people had "achievable" disads we have CP awards for fulfilling those.  One of my guys is a wizard with Obsession: Get Power.  It is so much fun to feed him CPs for that disad; it makes him chase the shiny like a megalomaniac kitten.<br><br>When we move to 4e, I'm not sure what we'll do with the Self-Control rolls.  Probably eliminate them wholesale and just use CP to incentivize advantages.<br><br>We play advanced combat, mainly because our virtual tabletop makes it very easy to keep track of figures, and advanced combat is lots of fun for me.  Generally with hand weapons, people are going to be knocked out before they're dead, so I haven't had trouble with PC fatalities.  Only NPCs take bleeding damage; the PCs have miracle coagulation.  If they walk away from an encounter, they're def. gonna live.<br><br>Is your play-by-post board public?

I was originally going to use Shadow of Yesterday's Keys, since the XP values can just convert to CP, but not everyone gets them at first.  Maybe it would be better to ask players to pick two opposing advantages/disadvantages, then tell them, if you have to choose between them in a game, you'll get CP.  That would work with GURPS elements, rather than introducing something new.  Thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\njohnzo: That was one of my big errors when I first ran GURPS - I never thought of anything other than 'nothing happens' or 'the worst thing ever happens' when a roll failed.  I think I'm getting better at it, to the point that I'm excited at the possibility of failure on the part of the players.  I have learned to keep the rolls straightforward, and I've ended up using Shadow of Yesterday's idea about using the Margin of Victory to help in your subsequent roll.  A good Sneak roll helps your Sleight of Hand roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the sense of self-control rolls, though I don't think I like them in practice.  They might be a case of telling the player "Say yes or roll the dice."  That is, if the GM think it'd be interesting, the player takes a CP and let the disadvantage affect them, or else roll the dice as a self-control roll, no CP either way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like options in combat, cause it usually means someone's trying to do something other than kill dudes.  I just get flustered when it seems like I'm forgetting how the flowchart should work.  It might just be inexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe board is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=103" rel="nofollow">Something Awful's Traditional Games forum</a>, I'm Twobirds there.  You have to pay to register, but you can browse the current threads without paying (and like any PbP board, there's lots of rules about jumping in).  Most of the GURPS games are pretty run-and-shooty, but there's a hard science Mission to Mars game, and a Warehouse 23 game, which are pretty interesting to read about.  The Banestorm swashbuckler/pirates game, in the midst of recruiting, is interesting, in that there are several house rules for maximizing the style of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
