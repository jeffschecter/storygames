It was at the Indie Games night at Modern Myths, one of our FLGSs. We had 9 players so we broke up into two groups and played. Both groups seemed to really enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Our group's Big Picture was "Humanity rises up to kill the Gods." Remarkably, we carried through on the premise, in spades. We stayed close to real world mythological sources while combining them. One of the Palette items was that there were other created species than humanity, so we had both Djinn and Angels; one of our periods was the Tower of Babel. A motif that arose and eventually became a Legacy was the family lines of the three thieves who had stolen the tools of the Gods (pulley, sword, fire) to build the Tower. In an early scene the Gods brought the whupass down on the thief who stole the first sword, which smelted the sword into the eon spanning (and later Legacy) Thunder Sword which eventually was used to kill that very God who had inadvertantly created it. <br/><br/>It was satisfyingly epic. The other table's game was similarly so, though space opera rather than antediluvian. An interesting effect of banning elements in the Palette had a wide reaching effect for them: they banned humans. So the story revolved around the robots (from the Big Picture), and then they had a wild time coming up with numberless non-human alien species. <br/><br/>Technique stuff:<br/>Both our tables played out a lot of scenes, which is pretty different from the experiences of folks in Jason's <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14430" rel="nofollow">recent thread</a>, and Paul T.'s where the main thrust felt like the event and period building. We relished the scenes, and did in fact have one immediate follow-up where we wanted to see what came next in the situation (after the Thunder-Sword was created. Actually, that was the moment when we as a group decided that the sword of the thief would become something important.) Early in the game we clustered our played scenes in one or two early periods so I think we didn't get the full effect of going forward and back in time with the scenes. Though the crafting of the events &amp; periods themselves was all over and did give us that wonderful freedom that I'd hoped for.<br/><br/>Things we did wrong were having a certain amount of table talk. I made sure that we observed the sacrosanct nature of everyone's Period, Event or Scene creation. But at our table, we chit-chatted about the implications of things we'd created and set expectations about what would come later in play based on them in a way that, I believe, stretched the spirit of the rules. But when I run or facilitate, I tend to err on the side of the mood of the group, and we were very happy with that kind of collaboration. I let it go. The other group was being strict about it. I look forward to comparing notes about that with them.<br/><br/>We never pushed. Never even thought about it. We were careful to observe the "your narration ends at the tip of my nose" rule.<br/><br/>There were some very interesting things that happened when there was an outcome in question, like the killing of the last god.I'd like to talk about that more somewhere. Basically, we moved all the way up to almost killing the god, and were all looking for what would push us over the edge--as players and as audience--to buy that we had successfully killed the Goddess Null. When Eppy suggested that his Djinn character who was sacrificing himself guided the sword of the smoke blinded Angel-born sword thief hero, and as a result got him caught up in the blast, turning him into the sun and Null into the moon, we all loved it and were well satisfied that the battle had been fairly won. Though now that I write that, it does mean that it wasn't humans who killed the last god, but the other creations who had come to the side of humanity!<br/><br/>Eppy just had the idea of playing a game of Microscope based around Godzilla appearing. I can't wait to play again...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329060/#Comment_329060" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T18:46:04+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  6:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>e were careful to observe the "your narration ends at the tip of my nose" rule.</blockquote>\nThis required some discussion for us - we're conditioned to endow and accept endowment around here.

Most of our crew was made up of experienced story gamers. Two were new to it. It made my introductory speech about not doing that feel kind of odd, since why would they assume they could say what happened to someone else's character? Sharing characters felt very natural. But not offering suggestions, or asking for them wasn't. Had to bite my lip a few times. <br/><br/>I remembered another way we strayed from the rules. Since we had too many players, I gave the book to the other group, along with the reference sheet and another one I made up with oddball rules. And we talked over the rules as one big group first. Still, apparently the other group initially thought that everyone made two nested Period/Event or Event/Scene pairs in a Focus round. They corrected that after a bit, but it slowed down their game. It's a lot of power, and I wonder how it played out for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329096/#Comment_329096" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T23:26:59+00:00" title="June 10, 2011 11:26PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any idea on what led you to play out more scenes than other groups?

I'll post a link when I get it from her. We had a lot of scenes, both dictated and not. We only introduced a couple Periods after the initial go-round. Partly due to being constrained by space, I think (we lined them up perpendicular to the length of the table). But also because we were interested in delving into the Periods we'd already created. The Tower of Babel period got a lot of attention, rightly so, I think. <br/><br/>We also played for 4 hours, minus about an hour for rules discussion, a break and creating our groups. We realized we had only 45 minutes or so left after doing 2 full lens go-rounds, so during Eppy's focus we just did dictated scenes so we could get to the fourth player's turn. We mostly did events and dictated scenes until the very end where we played out killing the last god. The final legacy made a nice coda: the creation of the heavens from the bodies of the Djinn and the Gods. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Any idea on what led you to play out more scenes than other groups?

Having Gods to play allowed us to be able to have continuity, we played Null and Solace at the birth of humanity, and all the way through the Final Battle with the Gods (the bookends of the game). Well, at least Null made it that far. Ben does caution against having time travel or immortality to guard against having characters appear again and again, but in this context it felt natural and, really, necessary. Another way that we created a strong sense of unity among the characters was having bloodlines of humans: those descended from the first human created, descendants of the three thieves, descendants of the angel that turned against the gods. So in later scenes we could have characters who were relations to those in earlier epochs.<br/><br/>We had one prophetic scene. I introduced a prophecy about the Thunder Sword after it came into play. That worked well, though the scene didn't necessarily have a strong reverberation, though some elements became re-incorporated later in play (the god of imagination who joined the side of the humans when they created the first University in the ruins of Babel). Answering the question in that scene was surprising: it was whether the humans rose up against their Djinn masters when they heard the prophecy. But the child who relayed the message from the god was realistically childlike and so was ignored by the adults. I was non-plussed about that for a moment, since the message had not gotten relayed after all, but then someone pointed out that it meant that it took the next generation to rebel: the friends of the Child who did believe. <br/><br/>Has anyone played two player? It seems like it would be neat, though different. I wonder if you could return to a timeline with less than the full group? I fully agree with not playing in one with someone who'd not built it. Too much too communicate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329225/#Comment_329225" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T07:49:25+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  7:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the write-up of the "SPACE Robots" game.<br/><br/>For our Big Picture, we knew we were feeling "space opera." Some of us wanted to do <i>Star Wars</i> after Episode VI, others wanted to re-write the ending of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.  (Here's where one might comment on how RPGs set in popular story universes usually bring out our preoccupations with narrative conclusions in said universes... but I digress).  Our group of 5 settled on the idea of "space kings" and came up with the Big Picture:<br/><b><br/>The Collapse of the Space Empire, and the Rise of the Space Kings</b><br/><br/>...which, incidentally, were also our Bookends.  We decided the fall of the space empire was "dark" whereas the space kings' rise was "light"  Perfect for the veneration for aristocracy underpinning most space opera!<br/><br/>The Palette came fast and furious:  yes to laser swords, gender equality ("king" is actually a gender neutral term), drug use, <b>spaceships being giant Greco-Roman statues</b>, telepathy, mounts, dragon-like beings, elected kings, and <b>robots</b>; no to <b>humans</b>, high magic, planet destroying devices, dogfights, time travel, space immediately killing you, nukes and desert robe-wearing mystical knights.<br/><br/>We then managed to get through only 2 different Foci \u2013 "The Greater Good" and "The Robots," meaning only 2 of the 5 of us got to be the Lens.

When we all realized we could create different creatures of shapes and sizes to populate the universe, we did so enthusiastically -- maybe at the expense of some more rigorous historical threads.  But then again: character creation is 50% of the entertainment of all RPGs, and this one has you constantly creating characters.<br/><br/>\u2022 It's easier to be cryptic on the Periods ("Scores Are Settled") when you know you're going to play their main Events out in Scenes.  Otherwise, you have to explicitly state occurrences in order to elicit player response from what you add to the Timeline.  In effect, you create a more open-ended, obtuse history if you emphasize the Scenes, and a straightforward history if you emphasize Periods/Events.<br/><br/>\u2022 I love the way in which the game forces us to be transparent about our likes/dislikes with regard to play.  The Palette is an easy Lines/Veils mechanism, and it also frames the "gonzo" level of the play itself.  Shared genre presumptions are always best communicated, and the gameplay itself forces you to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329237/#Comment_329237" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T10:26:31+00:00" title="June 12, 2011 10:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks, Emily.  Sounds like in each scene, in addition to answering the history question of what happened, you guys were answering character questions of "what's the last character's descendant like?" and "how do the Gods react to <i>this</i>?"  In that situation, instead of playing until I answered the history issue, I expect I'd play enough to get a good sense of who the characters were, how they related to or reflected on previous scenes, and <i>then</i> answer the history issue.  Is that what you guys did?<br/><br/>On the subject of relating and reflecting, I'm also curious if you guys needed any thematic glue beyond your Big Picture and simple genealogy to make that resonate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329411/#Comment_329411" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T12:08:54+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 12:08PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, Evan. It's neat the the characters were such a strong element. There is an amazing itch that it scratches. I think we had something similar--the characters we chose ended up creating large thematic elements (the families, epochs, etc.). The consequences of the scenes were often far reaching, like the Sword creation which turned into the next Focus round. <br/><br/>In the creation of Events, the book says to describe write a brief phrase, then describe what happened to the rest of the group. This had us scratching our heads many times to be sure that our events were at the right scale (Period: War; Event: Battle; Scene: Skirmish, was the analogy I made.) We wrote the description down on the back of the note card. Characters as well: on the back of the scene cards. That may have kept us more narrow with the events in play, though it's hard to compare.<br/><br/>David: The Legacies and Focii kept us working together as we went around. We were sometimes more or less on target with a Focus, esp. as we were getting used to following them. But mostly it was rock solid, and the elements created tied them in. If you mean a large scale theme or issue, our premise had many to pick from: hubris, human endeavor, power vs moral authority, rebellion, etc. We all grooved on each of these throughout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
