One of the guys came up as suspicious drinker, sitting sullenly at the bar looking over his shoulder incessantly.  I had no idea who he was or what he was doing there. One of our PCs works for the Agency, so when someone acts suspicious it's a nice, flashing arrow for her. She asked if she had seen this guy before.  "Yeah, he looks familiar, but you can't place him."  She sidled up to him to find out more and ended up freaking him out.  He turned tail and ran, she gave chase and er... interrogated.  Turns out this sad sack used to work for the Agency and was given a special project for them.  In attempting to carry it out, he burned down nearly a sixth of Denver after releasing a malevolent spirit from a crystal.  All this from a random NPC.  For me, connecting the dots is a way more fun way to GM than the play-through-my-unfinished-novel mode.  I must add more to my diet!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392305/#Comment_392305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T21:13:50+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  9:13PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last Kerberos Fate session had the PCs courting, being courted, or watching courtships as Queen Victoria married.<br/><br/>Lady Alice Beauchamps complained about the debauched, scandalous, yet honorable Lord George Mace's habit of calling her Lady Cassandra (as she tends to have visions of dangers to come).<br/><br/>Alice: He still persists in getting my name wrong. It's most irritating!<br/><br/>Sophronia, the Clockwork Faerie: You could tell him,<br/><br/>Alice: I think he knows.<br/><br/>Sophronia: I could spell it out in fiery letters above his head.<br/><br/>Alice declined the offer.<br/><br/>Lord Gregory Sage, Heir of Pennsington (who is actually Lord Sage's servant, taking his master's place so that the master can live happily with his wife in Africa) is courting Sophronia, the 9 inch clockwork faerie.<br/><br/>Player: You realize you're courting a nine year old, right?<br/><br/>Sophronia: Yes, but I was born with my current level of maturity<br/><br/>Gregory: While it is near the bottom, it is on my list of things to worry about.<br/><br/>Player: That she's nine or that she acts her age?<br/><br/>Gregory: That's nearer the top of the list.<br/><br/>Player: Not that you're the Earl of Pennsington?<br/><br/>Gregory: That's the top of my list.<br/><br/>Gregory's player asked Sophronia's player to see her character sheet for a moment.<br/><br/>Sophronia's player: I don't think it's absolutely fair to have access to a lady's character sheet. <br/><br/>Lady Alice disguised herself, taking on the identity of Lord Alec Campion, as she often does. (Why, yes, we are fans of Ellen Kushner's works.) In this identity, she paid Lord Mace a visit, mentioning that Lady Alice's cousin (and head of the family) didn't want Lady Alice going off on adventures before she was safely married, and generally intimating that she might perhaps like Lord Mace to be her husband. Lord Mace said that Lady Alice, if she did have someone in particular in mind, should make sure that her messenger would make her intent clear and unmistakeable. And that is why Lord Campion kissed Lord Mace in Lord Mace's box at the opera. You see, there is a good reason for everything.<br/><br/>But, there were other things than romance on people's minds. Victor, for instance, decided he no longer needed the maid that Abraham Lincoln said he should hire (long story, and Young Lincoln is no longer a PC), so he turned to Gregory to see that she could find another situation and not go back to being a prostitute. Gregory told Sophronia that the maid, Lydia, should clean the house Sophronia is living in with her creator / father, who is working to give sentience to a mechanical giant (Talos -- Sophronia has decided that Talos is her cousin) that a colleague of his with anarchist ties created. The idea was that the maid could get caught up in schemes of the anarchist leader, Croyle, and be pumped regularly for information by Gregory. Sophronia wasn't sure about this plan.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Our rehabilitation skills need much to be desired.<br/><br/>Gregory: Croyle has not yet killed anyone that I know of.<br/><br/>Sophronia (indignant): He took Talos from me!<br/><br/>Gregory: He's not totally disagreeable, mreely mostly disagreeable.<br/><br/>Sophronia: He's a cousinnapper!<br/><br/>Gregory: Fair enough!<br/><br/>Sophronia: I do not think most maids want to blow things up!<br/><br/>Player: It's a much quicker way of getting things clean, however.<br/><br/>Gregory: Ah, I see where I am miscommunicating.<br/><br/>He explained that he was quite sure that she wouldn't be doing anything with bombs; more likely, she'd be distributing pamphlets.<br/><br/>Sophronia: I will be very upset if I find out that you have convinced Victor's maid to get involved in blowing things up! It's very dangerous!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392345/#Comment_392345" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T09:58:59+00:00" title="October  4, 2012  9:58AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played our second session of End of the Empire (Fantasy Flight's new Star Wars RPG) last night, with five in-person players and a virtual player as a laptop/skype combo.  It was fantastic.  We did a sort of linked-test interrogation where each player was taken aside and grilled by Imperial Customs which led to the ship being scanned and some cargo being confiscated.  <br/><br/>The next scene was a blaster-filled, chaotic escape from the Imperial Interdictor in true Star Wars fashion.<br/><br/>The game is giving me all kinds of interesting thoughts about cultural touchstones.  I mean, I can say "you're going to Nar Shadda" and everyone in the group (because we're all Star Wars nerds) knows exactly what that means.  Everyone has this rich background to draw on and so can get excited at a name instead of me, as GM, having to say "which means..." and explain what Nar Shadda is about.  It's the closest I've ever been, I think, to that sense of the characters and players sharing an equal knowledge base about the universe the game is set in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392347/#Comment_392347" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T10:07:02+00:00" title="October  4, 2012 10:07AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2012 10:07AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            World of Dungeons, Caves of Chaos gonzo edition: The wizard got his soul returned to his body after a fair amount of time co-inhabiting a female hobgoblin.

This was apparently the Heart's Desire episode: The Nutjob Cleric's heart's desire was to convert the Demigod Tyrant, Thunder-in-Silence; the Explosive Mage's was to unlock the power of the Mobius Flower; and the Half-Dragon's was to find True Love with the Lord of Shadows. So, the Lord of Shadows sent them to recover the Mobius Flower from Thunder-in-Silence before he could figure out how to unlock its power! (The Conniving Thief, went along for the ride, and because who knows, maybe he could get a title out of this (his heart's desire)).<br/><br/>After an Iron Chef battle on the beach that they arrived at (secret ingredient: sea turtle eggs!) with mecha piloting Iron Chefs, they bamboozled their way across the country and into the 3rd of seven palaces.  They then managed to trick and connive (avoiding traps and subtle snares) their way to the 7th palace and Thunder-in-Silence. After a hard fought battle (and a number of stress explosions), the four of them took the tyrant down (all of his supporters having already fled the Explosive Mage), and summoned the Lord of Shadows and his monochrome gangsters and carried off the flower and the tyrant. This apparent success is, of course, only a setup for next episode's disaster (this being the players' opinion, actually).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392446/#Comment_392446" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T09:33:39+00:00" title="October  5, 2012  9:33AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This game is so good!

The first two are over now. The first was mostly setup and character creation also learning the game and all that. I as the MC did not enjoy it as much as I hoped for that session. I felt rather limited by the Apocalypse World system and the Moves system at my disposal and also had to get into the rules. It almost seemed like a chore to me and one of the few games I'd much rather be a player in than a GM.<br/>Still over the week I thought about it and planned with the little town and the characters we set up and came up with an idea and a big bad for the Chosen we have in the group. Gained some confidence and motivatione back and was ready to try it again.<br/>Todays game really was fun. The bickering and interactions between the characters and npcs really was what we looked for in the system and some perfect comedic timing really made it a joy to play. Also the plot ideas I had worked out well within the stuff the players were doing and all the choices mattered. I am warming up to the Hard Moves too, one of them did bring in a whole new element to the game and now one of the characters has to get rid of drugs. I liked the conditions as well. With stuff like "Drugmule" and "In Love" causing various troubles.<br/>Three player characters seems a little low though. I'd rather play it with four or five I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392793/#Comment_392793" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T21:14:57+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  9:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2012 9:20PM by Caesar_X.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Dirty Half-Dozen at Big Bad Con, using The Regiment Alpha 2.0 rules.<br/><br/><a href="http://twitter.com/evade/status/254707522164887552/photo/1" rel="nofollow">Great fun!</a><br/><br/>Some favorite moments<br/>-The crazy Commando lighting up a quad MG-42 on a group of Nazi dignitaries, with a lit cigarette hanging off his lip.<br/>-Two completely failed rolls leading to a very Hard Move: the entire team tied to 17th century wooden chairs in a castle room, watched over by German guards as Herr Doktor walks in with an ornate silver tray full of syringes and scalpels. <br/>-The quiet "farmboy" attempting to fly a Nazi gyro copter into the back of a moving half track.

Turn into something reasonable!<br/><br/>He turned into a platypus.<br/><br/><br/>Gregory to Victor; No! Nonono! One of these days, I will finish a sentence in front of you! <br/><br/><br/>Victor (about one of Alice's suggestions): I suggested that ten minutes ago.<br/><br/>Gregory: I couldn't hear you -- you were too loud.<br/><br/><br/>Alice (talking about psychic mediums they know after a young nobleman has asked for her to use her psychic talents on his project, rather than on her more urgent one): Do we have to count the one in Africa? (nb: He is British and rather a putz. I suspect Lady Alice would be perfectly happy to count a competent African medium, if she happened to know one.)<br/><br/>Victor: If we want to make it plural. But there is Dominic Creahador. Who hates all nobles.<br/><br/>Player (obviously Out of Character): We should introduce him to Dominic Creahador. They can have a buddy movie.<br/><br/><br/>Gregory (as he's trying to court Sophronia): I'm afraid I'm badly botching this.<br/><br/>Sophronia's player: Sophronia kisses you.<br/><br/><br/>It only remained for Gregory to be browbeaten into telling his mother the news about his ladylove.<br/><br/>Gregory: There is one who outshines the rest.<br/><br/>Gregory's Mother: And does this solar paragon have a name?<br/><br/>Gregory: If it were anyone other than you, I'd say to sit down.<br/><br/>Gregory's Mother (dramatizing for effect): Oh! She has a name. I must sit down at once!<br/><br/><br/>Gregory's Mother (on learning the details): Does the anatomy work?<br/><br/>Gregory: We're still figuring that out. (realizes how that sounds)<br/><br/><br/>Now, Gregory did not think at all kindly of Lord Winston Beauchamp, Alice's cousin. Nevertheless, he found himself in an odd position when Winston filled Gregory's mother in on just what Gregory's important Save the World (from the Martians) mission was.<br/><br/>Gregory (as Winston leads his mother into a dance so that they can talk): Thank you very much, Lord Beauchamp. (beat) That is not a sentence I expected to utter tonight. Or any time this century. (NB: The year is 1840.)<br/><br/><br/>Gregory, aka the Pennsington Heir (sort of) to Sophronia: How would you like to be the new Lady Pennsington?<br/><br/>Sophronia (flustered): Can we work on there still being a British Government first? (on account of the Martian problem, naturally)<br/><br/><br/>I'd originally thought the PCs would sail from Britain this session, but realized that Josh was correct and there was far too much to do in London. I figure they've got a 50-50 shot of getting away next session, though Lady Alice will have to explain to her cousin that she plans to marry the Odious Lord Mace, who kissed Alec Campion at the opera, Alec Campion being, unknown to Winston, Lady Alice in disguise (not that Lord Mace hasn't kissed rather a lot of men, as well as rather a lot of women, not to mention doing rather a lot more than kissing....)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392812/#Comment_392812" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T05:14:39+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  5:14AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2012 5:16AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tremulus at Big Bad Con: In a beautifully Lovecraftian way we accidentally pried open the lid of a can of crazy, and when it came back at us in really horrifying ways, we did not want to fight it, we did not want to learn about it, we fell to our knees and apologized and pleaded to forget the tiny sliver of impossibility we'd seen and be left alone. <br/><br/>That is not what happened.<br/><br/>Money quote, rich uncle to wastrel nephew: "While we tried our best to convince you, as it happens we do not technically <i>need </i>you to succeed.

Alex, the Angel in question, had previously been given a mission by Alimon, messenger of God, to exonerate Benedict, the Ghost, from the murder of Samuel, a monster hunter (and son of IFPD Sergeant Yusef). Alex had been in love with Samuel and blamed the Hollow, Clara, for his death (even though Clara and benedict knew that it had really been the werewolf, Jennifer, who'd mauled the boy to death at Benedict's house on the night of the full moon (whoops!). <br/><br/>Alex tried getting some drugs off of Mike, the skeevy drug dealing kid at Ichor Falls High School, which took some doing, in order to put them in Jennifer's body in order to make sure Benedict didn't take the rap for Sam's death, but Benedict spilled the beans to some kids at school about the real cause of death, with Alex present, making Alex's meeting at school the next morning with Mike now useless.<br/><br/>Not to be deterred, Alex was also jealous of Clara because the Lord loved Clara more than He loved Alex, so Alex Gazed Into the Abyss one too many times (this time trying to figure out how to frame Clara for Samuel's death), and...SATAN answered. "DONE," he said in his wicked and inscrutable way, and the very next day, the cops showed up, ignoring the nonplussed Benedict who was fully expecting they'd come for him. They arrested Clara and brought her to the police station, where they left her to wait in the interrogation room.<br/><br/>Benedict shows up to the station and starts to confess (in the next room over) that it was really his fault for not letting Samuel kill Jennifer's wolf form while it was unconscious (hey, she was Ben's girlfriend, after all), when Alex bursts into the room, "confessing" to giving Jennifer drugs to make the tranquilizer dart wear off so that she could kill Samuel, since Samuel had been seeing Vicky (the singer in Ben's band, The Gravestoners), and if Alex couldn't have him, NO ONE COULD. Hence the getting shot in the leg part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392902/#Comment_392902" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T13:33:26+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  1:33PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "What kind of drug might make you eat somebody's face?"<br/><br/>So many Bath Salts jokes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392943/#Comment_392943" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T19:36:39+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  7:36PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Death asks the Ghost if he's ready to move on yet, fade to black before we get an answer, end credits.</blockquote>\nBeautiful.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392946/#Comment_392946" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T19:53:53+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  7:53PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, And I liked when Alex said to grief-stricken Sergeant Yusef, "And if you don't believe me, go see Mike at school in the morning.

I SAY AGAIN, VIEWSCREAM.<br/>A lot of creepy drama packed into roughly an hour and a half. I (Joseph Le May) was Weapons, the overanalytical, pushy arrogant prick-type. Medical (Clarissa Baut Stetson)was a bit meek and not as competent as Weapons would have liked, and he kind of ran roughshod over her in a few scenes. Bridge (Raphael Chandler, the designer of the game) tried to assert his authority, and Weapons had to shut him down with reminders of their time in the war. Engineering (Kieth Stetson) just went batshit crazy early on, and it turned out to be all Medical's fault in the end, but we didn't find that out for sure until after my favorite scene, more on which in a moment. In the end, the mechanical results had Engineering and Weapons both surviving, except Engineering had been absorbed by the hideous otherwordly biomass that had been gradually spreading itself throughout the ship like a sentient cancer, and Weapons decided he'd rather resign and die with his old soldier buddy, Bridge, than leave a fallen comrade! There were some incredibly cheap, yet amazingly effective special effects, such as Clarissa's use of a ziploc bag's zipper to simulate video interference, and Kieth's creative use of aluminum foil (not to mention his incredible HAL 9000 monotone)!<br/><br/>So my favorite scene was an impromptu one:<br/><br/>Bridge is on with Medical and, mid-conversation, Bridge's connection to the G+ Hangout lags and disconnects. Weapons just jumps in and starts interrogating Medical on why she would use a retroviral pathogen sequencer (which sounds like some sort of exotic anti-pathogen) to knit Engineering's broken leg. He gets increasingly irritated as she stumbles over her answer, and when Bridge comes back online and tells Weapons to chill out a sec and let them figure it out, Bridge's player (Raphael) types into the chat "Totally don't chill out at all. GO BANANAS." Bananas indeed, sir.<br/><br/>[EDIT: Typed too slow.

Compton (Nigel), drug-crazed journalist for Rolling Stone magazine, makes his way to a small town called Innsmouth in search of a scoop -- something about a new religious movement rising from the ashes of the counterculture. Compton manages to remain sober for about seven minutes, then he's off. In a scene that we later realize is reminiscent of real events, he takes a crowbar to the face from an angry ex-biker. It was my first time playing with Nigel, and holy fucking Belial, that guy is guano-loco cool.<br/><br/>His photographer, Judith (Gaz), doesn't particularly care for Compton, but she grits her teeth and tries to get the job done, even when it turns out that the locals are a bunch of free-love wackos who think that the ocean is our mother. Things get weird when some people try to get Judith into the water. "You belong there," they say. She doesn't want any part of this, and tries to escape these fish-loving weirdos.<br/><br/>Moses Silver (not the name on his birth certificate, natch) is my character, a former member of the Weather Underground who's haunted by memories of the violent acts he committed in the name of the people. Moses is now the leader of a cult called The Waters of Life, but he's a total fraud. When he's not sleeping with female members of the group, he's getting his marching orders from his muse/mistress/priestess, Annabelle.<br/><br/>Annabelle Waite (Elina) is the true source of power in the cult, and is Moses' spiritual advisor and commander. She turns out to have a profound connection to the ocean, and she's hell-bent on getting Judith into the water, where she belongs. Over time, we realize that Annabelle is most definitely not human, and she is utterly without compassion. The worse things get, the more serene she becomes. The things in the water are hers, and she is theirs.<br/><br/>Compton managed to escape, bent cigarette holder clenched in his teeth, eyes wide with horror (or amphetamines). He had the story of a lifetime, but no one would ever believe him.<br/><br/>Judith was dragged into the water, where she saw them: phosphorecent tentacles rising from the sea, and above those, innumerable translucent egg sacs floating in the air, like glowing skate egg cases, tentacled fetuses writhing within. Freaked out, and lucky to be alive, she escaped the carnage, even as another woman was torn to pieces by the things in the water. She managed to get out of town without ever discovering her true nature.<br/><br/>Moses got pregnant. Half-mad with terror, and consumed with guilt for the terrorist attacks he committed during his time with the Weather Underground, Moses pretty much lost his grip. He tried to prove to Judith (who, at the time, was being held hostage by the cult) that it was safe to go into the sea. "Nothing will happen," he said. Annabelle tried to stop him, because Moses is just a human, unlike Judith -- for him, it was actually not very safe at all. But he entered the sea, and bad things happened. He came out of the water with something inside him. Short version: Moses gave birth in a scene like something out of a PETA video. Bad stuff! Good times!<br/><br/>Annabelle, the cult's true leader, put Moses' mangled body back into the water and told him that he would heal. "They will care for you," she said. "And you will bear me many more children."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394421/#Comment_394421" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T06:29:27+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  6:29AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...

Accusations, breakdowns, violence, arguments, and betrayal, along with forbidden rituals, ghosts, strange visions, and the undead.<br/><br/>Absolutely amazing. For me, the highlights were too many to number, but Elina's character had a savage freakout where she ranted about how hard it was to do the horrible things she'd done, then withdrew into herself and whispered about the day she'd lost the person she loved most. Just a really powerful scene, particularly considering that we'd just learned she was a cold-blooded murderer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Even the pregen characters are pretty great.  Tonight's highlights:<br/><br/>The PCs are enmeshed in the plot of the province's regent Shingen, ravaged by illness and plotting to have his soul captured after death and placed inside the undying iron body of a kongohki to continue ruling from beyond the grave.  His heretical karma draws in:<br/><br/>Mi-Hal the Oni weapons master, last free Oni in the province, searching for his son and fellow villagers, abducted to be slain and their hearts harvested to power the lord's new body.<br/><br/>The oni were kidnapped by the ninja clan of Seikichi the shinobi, but after an attack of conscience renounced his clan and became a fugitive, searching to free the victims his clan wronged.<br/><br/>Seikichi's clan was hired by Haruko, armour rider pilot of the mecha Star Chalice and eldest child of the regent.  A somewhat peripheral NPC in our first session, this time she was upgraded to PC status by a player who missed last week, and during the Zero Act established her as less malicious than loyal to her father's will above all other concerns.<br/><br/>Haruko's uncle Okinosuke is torn between his family loyalty and his natural compassion and doctor's oaths to help the helpless.  He has also been hiding the fact that he has become an annelidist, symbiotically bound to various weaponized insects.<br/><br/>Before his illness, Lord Shingen was arranged to be wed to Kurako, a noble's daughter from a neighboring province. Unknown to all, including herself, Kurako is an artificial being, a kugutsu carved from wood and magicked to appear living.  She is devoted to her desperately ill fiance, and dangerously naive.<br/><br/>After a quick round of introductory scenes during the Zero Act, things go into high gear almost immediately, as Mi-Hal escapes "protective custody" (brought on by his wild accusations that the lord's own daughter was responsible for his people's disappearance) and is met at the gates by Haruko in Star Chalice, here to eliminate her accuser.  The Oni stands fast as the mecha-scale sword whistles toward him, declaring an aiuchi; he declines defense in exchange for a devastating stroke of his own and spends 28 Kiai to roll 36 dice in his counterattack (which leaves him at 107 Karma, almost totally consumed by rage and sorrow).  Both fighters are grievously harmed but still standing.<br/><br/>Mi-Hal decides the province's rot begins at the head and reenters the palace, telekinetically flinging away guards and sliding open doors as Star Chalice follows outside, reaching in through windows and smashing holes in the wall.  The commotion attracts the rest of the group and they converge in the lord's chamber where he lies in his sickbed, too weak to move.  Panicking, Haruko readies her Dragon Howler Cannon, but Mi-Hal's player spends Kiai to interrupt, reaching out with his mind to use her own father as a human shield.  Haruko fires anyway, but her uncle the annelidist leaps forward to take the blow himself.  A pitched battle ensues over the lord's helpless body, full of interrupted actions, ninja shadow duplicates, and mighty blows desperately blocked at great cost to the defenders.  At the end, Shingen lies dead in his gardens, floating in a koi pond staining red with his blood, Haruko paralyzed by annelid venom and watching impotently from her shattered armour with one good eye as her traitorous uncle and stepmother lead the oni villagers from the dungeons.  Vengeance blooms in the new regent's heart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394895/#Comment_394895" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T03:51:59+00:00" title="October 26, 2012  3:51AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Be Ashamed, Young Prince</blockquote>\nThat sounds epically cool... and clever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394913/#Comment_394913" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T09:25:50+00:00" title="October 26, 2012  9:25AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2012 5:03AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Microscope, a Cold War history.

One spent most of the scene talking about how wonderful the other character (i. e., the actor himself) was, while the other portrayed the character (i. e., the other actor) as a constipated idiot with his foot literally up his ass.
