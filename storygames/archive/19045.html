It\u2019s not meant to be a hidden roll. Make sure they know what they roll against (what level of passive or active opposition) before the dice hit the table.<br/><br/>If they succeed, what they believed becomes the truth retroactively.

If we need stats to dole out types of player effectiveness, cool, but we can do that directly without pretending it stems from skilled character actions.

You have an \u2018unresolved truth\u2019 about her innocence, but the PCs like her and grow to trust her. Then \u201cwhen the hammer falls\u201d and someone looks through her stuff, or another suspect appears, or she is in a position to betray the PCs, lets say it shows that the truth-finder-outery (say Empathy) roll failed and she is revealed to have been guilty all along. Then of course a claim like \u201cher sisters life was on the line\u201d is up for grabs, if there is time to establish an \u201cunresolved truth\u201d about that before her betrayal is narrated in an evil way or some other contradiction arises in the fiction.<br/><br/>I usually don\u2019t mind an IC/OOC divide so I don\u2019t mind most of the rolls being made immediately or pretty soon, letting only some stay \u201cunresolved\u201d.

Having a game economy around questions and answers sounds more fun to me than playing the "freely refine questions until the result fits what I already thought about Sonya" game, for example, but maybe that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425516/#Comment_425516" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T03:09:46+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  3:09AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things that are interesting to use this with Fate in particular might be how the players can invoke relevant aspects to influence the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425530/#Comment_425530" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T06:38:07+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  6:38AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 6:54AM by Dreamer.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I wrote first was sort of irrelevant to what you were talking about, sorry. <br/><br/>For secrets, one thing that I've experimented with is using inductive reasoning; specifically the Bayesian formula. I try to find evidence that supports an event being true and if I can use elements that have already been established, all the better, as it feels less like ret-conning. <br/><br/>I would try to roll for the likelihood of evidence that Sonya is innocent (maybe find a witness that can place her somewhere else, etc). Or,I might just switch the statement, and try to find evidence that Sonya is guilty. If I fail to find it, then I must conclude that she is innocent.<br/><br/><br/><del>I\u2019ve been using something similar to keep some tension in my solo gaming. I sort of thought of it as a \u201cSelf Fulfilling Prophecy\u201d on the part of the character I\u2019m playing. I like to represent it to myself using relationship maps, where each connection has an arbitrary percentage of the chance of some belief about that NPC being true. Those percentages either go up or down depending on the result of the roll. <br/><br/>Say, Caesar believes that Brutus is trustworthy, and I choose to represent that aspect of the relationship with a note \u201cI can trust Brutus\u201d, and a value of 90%. I roll 2d10 whenever I want to test that aspect of the relationship. Whatever the result of the roll, I adjust according to my own judgment. A minor failure, like say, Brutus stealing my towel at the public bath, would drop that value to 85% (entirely arbitrary number that I think is objective and proportional to the importance of the event). Now, if Brutus happens to stab me violently, that value would go down to absolute minimum, maybe 1%. Never zero to allow for luck to have an effect if I want to see if he repents in a future roll (if I survive the stabbing).<br/><br/>I also may decide at some point to freeze the percentage if the relationship feels "defined" after a few of these rolls.<br/><br/>The only downside to this method is that it might cause zombie Shakespeare to roll in his grave.<br/></del> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425585/#Comment_425585" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T12:41:35+00:00" title="December  9, 2013 12:41PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 12:42PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If I fail to find it, then I must conclude that she is innocent.</blockquote>\nIf you do find it, does that establish in the fiction that she is guilty?<br/><br/>If so, the end result seems identical to the original suggestion, but with an added fictional event of discovery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425593/#Comment_425593" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T13:18:13+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  1:18PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 1:26PM by Dreamer.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>:<br/><br/>Yeah, the fictional result is the same, but I feel there is a difference in how one experiences making a roll for "Sonya is innocent of the theft!" vs  making a roll for "I find the stolen object on Sonya" (edit to say that I would much rather frame it as "Do I find the stolen object on Sonya?" The former perhaps requires you  to retrofit the fiction with the details, whereas in the latter you're sort of "living" through the process if you make your character look for the evidence.  <br/><br/>The other difference is that the first way of framing the roll means that upon success, it is pretty much cased closed as far as that particular secret goes. The second way of framing the roll, that is by looking for evidence, is that unless the evidence is pretty damning (and convincing to you as player/character), you could still leave it as a somewhat open question: what if someone planted the stolen object on Sonya? Or, if I didn't find it, does that mean she didn't stash it somewhere else?  <br/><br/>I can see cases where one might not want this kind of open ended result, and it would be much better to know for sure with a roll so as to move on, but sometimes this kind of inconclusive answer adds to the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425595/#Comment_425595" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T13:39:14+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  1:39PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, gotcha.
