It is construed to lead two players through a set scenario. I would like people to play it, and to post an actual play report here. The report should contain the age and gender of the players, a resume of what happened, and some general thoughts on how the game worked.<br/><br/>I'll try to play it this weekend myself, and post an actual play report here by monday or tuesday. I hope some of you will do the same. When we have 3 or more reports, we may have some basis for an interesting discussion.<br/><br/>My goal is twofold, and are given in the next post. Try to play the game as is, before you read that post. <br/>_______________________________<br/><br/><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style="color: #000033;"><b>TALK &amp; TELL</b><br/>- a role-playing game for two<br/><br/>This game is meant to focus on what the characters feel, and how they fill some traditional scenes in a relationship. It is a game of ordinary people. Try to play it with a good balance of reason and emotion. Try to imagine being in the shoes of the character you play.<br/><br/><b>The rules</b><br/><br/>One of you is A, the other is B. You will get names starting with that letter, as part of the play. When your name is given (by you or your co-player), it is set.<br/><br/>- <i>Talk</i> - is in-character speak only.<br/>- <i>Tell</i> - is narrative only. Make it as detailed as you want. Do not include any conversation in these scenes.<br/><br/>Copy the scene-summary, so both of you got it. Both need a pen too, to note names and other details. Sit opposite each other, by a small table. Be sure you are undisturbed.<br/><br/>Follow the scenes numbered below, from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> to the end. Observe that the letters indicate who is in each scene. If the scene is "A+B" your are together in playing out the scene. Do this at your own discretion.<br/><br/>Any one of you may end any scene, by "cutting" it with your hands. End the scene immediately when this happens. When a scene ends, you go directly to the next scene. <br/><br/>Go with the flow. Have fun!<br/><br/><b>The scenes</b><br/><br/>1 A: Tell how you first saw him/her.<br/><br/>2 B: Tell how you first saw him/her.<br/><br/>3 A+B: Talk your very first talk.<br/><br/>4 A+B: Tell how you had a serious accident<br/><br/>5 A+B: Talk a low-voiced conversation by a hospital-bed<br/><br/>6 A: Talk your proposal.<br/>6 B: Tell how you react to the proposal.<br/>6 A: Tell how you feel while waiting for the answer.<br/>6 B: Tell how he/she reacts when you answer YES to his/her proposal.<br/><br/>7 A: Tell how you observe him/her in a shoe-shop<br/><br/>8 A: Tell how you find a place for you two to live.<br/><br/>9 A+B: Talk on the phone with each other.<br/><br/>10 A+B: Talk: B is talking with his/her worried mother on the phone, and A is commenting/butting in on the conversation.<br/><br/>11 A: Tell how you organize the wedding dinner for the two of you.<br/>11 B: Talk your speach to him/her at your wedding dinner.<br/>11 B: Tell how the two of you dance your wedding waltz.<br/><br/>12 A+B: Tell the birth/adoption of your first child.<br/><br/>13 A+B: Tell how the child is christened, and what name it gets.<br/><br/>14 B: Tell how your little family celebrate the first birthday of the child.<br/><br/>15 A+B: Tell how A punish the child for something it has done, and how B react to the punishment.<br/><br/>16 A+B: Talk some everyday bickering between you.<br/><br/>17 A+B: Talk a very serious quarrel. Raise your voices. One of you will end it with a really hurtful comment.<br/><br/>18 B: Tell how you observe him/her in the park.<br/><br/>19 A+B: Talk why one of you want to divorce the other, and how the other react.<br/><br/>20 A+B: Tell how you see each other for the last time.<br/><br/>21 A: Tell the place you live after the divorce; describe it meticulously.<br/><br/>22 A+B: Talk your last telephone-talk ever. The connection is bad, so use "cracked" voices.<br/><br/><b>THE END</b></span></span><br/><br/>__________________________<br/> <br/>Please try it out, and tell us how you fared.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_340416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340416/#Comment_340416" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T03:20:40+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  3:20AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2011 3:21AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please play the game above before you read the white text.<br/><br/>(white text; mark it to read)<br/><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">My goal is twofold:<br/>1 - To see how such a set scenario plays out differently in the hands of different players.<br/>2 - To see if the railroading gives room for aspects of the characters that are not normally part of a role-playing game.</span><br/>(end of white text)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340542/#Comment_340542" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T21:13:35+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  9:13PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds interesting.

I did leave a note that the players should feel free to go with the original A and B if they wished.<br/><br/>I also added a couple of translator's notes to parts that aren't common in Korean culture--the wedding waltz, for instance, and christening. (While Christianity is quite widespread, not all denominations baptize infants. Also more than half the populations are Buddhist, non-religious, or practice other religions, and so don't have baptizing ceremonies at all.) I added the options to replace those scenes with a traditional ceremony where the married couple pay respects to the groom's parents, and the baby's hundredth-day party.<br/><br/>My fiance didn't want to play this with me because he thought it was sad how the story ended with divorce. I'll try to find another player, and maybe others will submit APs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
