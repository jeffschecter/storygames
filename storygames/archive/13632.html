It is still the game that catches the most intimate meaning of what true science fiction is).<br/> <br/>I think that shock: enjoys a great general appreciation, which has been in my case going as far as ignoring the (constructive!) criticism which I see the game needs, now that I have grown aware of designing issues I previously ignored. Of course this is my point of view, but I am going to try and be as impartial as I can. <br/>I should point that these observations come from the problems I am facing while designing my own game. During the initial conception phase, shock: has been a reference point to me, but in the end ended up seeing in it problems I previously not been able to perceive.<br/>I see two reasons that make me consider shock: as not as good a game design product as it could and should have been.<br/><br/> <br/><b>First</b>, I think that the distribution of roles amongst players is a crystallization of the paradigm established in Polaris, which consists in:<br/><br/>1) focus on one character at a time, with the system passively discouraging other player characters' direct interaction within a scene; the result is players often having parallel narrations, often not even meeting;<br/><br/>2) rotation of three basic roles: focus character (protagonist, heart), opposition (antagonist, mistaken) and audience (audience, the moons);<br/><br/>3) limited role of the audience. Protagonist and antagonist can accept or refuse audience's narrative suggestions, despite the audience being encouraged to provide suggestions for the narration. Audience in Polaris (the Moons) did, however control bystanding characters, thus having access to the narration in a direct, however limited way. In shock: that is absent and the audience only controls abstract or inanimate elements of the fiction (the minutia).<br/> <br/><b>Second</b>, shock: features a problem with downtimes during conflict which is huge enough that in a couple games I've seen protagonist and antagonist losing sight of the stakes ("wait, which were the stakes again?").<br/> <br/>I will now analyze the two issues I sketched here above exactly work<br/> <br/><b>Structure of play:</b><br/>In the case of shock, I see an adherence to a previous model that makes the word "dogmatic" come to my mind. I apologize to Joshua is that is perceived as derogatory. I do imagine that there may be a coincidence of interest, i.e. an active choice on Joshua's part in having shock: follow exacly the same pattern as Polaris amongst other possible choices. <br/>In other words, in a science fiction with multiple protagonists, especially in certain novels, it does often happen that protagonists lead parallel stories and never meet or only occasionally meet. The system of shock: encourages this trend, and it's very reasonable. I would like to know if this is the thought behind Joshua's choice.<br/>On the other hand, I am highly critical of the role of the audience which is limited to interfering through minutia, which most often are inanimate or abstract portions of the setting. This also sometimes poses a problem of forceful introduction of minutia. In my experience it often happened that audience would like to intervene because they prefer one outcome rather than the other, but never being able to actively use minutias in play and continuously creating single-use minutias that added little to the shock's depth. This may be a wrong way of playing the game. Again, Joshua should confute my observation if appropriate.<br/>Other games have faced the same Polaris paradigm (which was an immense innovation when it was published, and adhered to no paradigm I could recognize) in different ways. Dirty Secrets has one protagonist (so the focus on one character) and the rest of the players cover an active role as antagonist. That could be done through a rotation pattern with the benefit of having all players actively participating to a scene (the word itself "audience" imply passivity). Gun Thief separates roles and defines them, but all are very active roles. Hell For Leather has all characters work together. <br/>Rotating roles would turn both Dirty Secrets and Gun Thief in full fledged masterless games, but both are meant to be permanently focused on one character unlike shock:.<br/>On a side note, I have seen players bored of being confined to the role of audience and unsatisfied of being limited to provide counsel and comments on a scene, and the reason given was the reluctance of disrupting a scene's flow.<br/>So I consider the crystallization of the Polaris paradigm as a weak point in shock:.<br/><br/><b>Downtimes:</b><br/>In very simple words, downtimes is whenever a game (both rpg and boardgame) has its flow arrested in order to do the math. Roleplaying games have been very permissive with downtimes through their history. Boardgames, on the other hand, have never been through the very damaging phase of "system does not matter" and never suffered from brain damage and its aftermath. There has always been a very strict criticism in system flow and functionality, and a downtime is seen as an unforgivable design mistake. You never see boardgamers disagree on that.<br/>We are talking about two different type of games, of course. But I do believe that we have to learn from board games in this aspect, to a certain degree. In roleplaying games  downtimes are often inevitable, but can be masked by having them interact with the narration. By doing so, the narration goes forward and the downtime is not perceived as a nuisance. I would like to call in the structure of conflicts in Dogs in the Vineyard, where each raise of the stake must be followed by a narration that gives substance within the fiction to that move. I do not see that in the many calculations that follow the designation of stakes in shock:.<br/>The structure is:<br/> <br/>calling a conflict and determining stakes<br/>choosing the praxis scale<br/>choosing and rolling dice, then decide what dice to keep<br/>comparing results and determining who wins their stake and who does not<br/>having the audience roll their dice, determine who has the right to speak and having him calculate his impact on the current status of the conflict (it may happen that the audience may not change a result even when they interfere)<br/>having the audience choose which minutia to call in and in case have them create a new minutia<br/>re-calculate winners and losers, and in case, have the conflict escalate<br/>having characters risking their links in order to reroll (and basically have to recalculate the conflict's outcome)<br/>finally determine the conflict's final outcome and only then describe what has just happened.<br/> <br/>In this process I see many, many downtimes that drag the conflict in a way that makes it unnecessarily long (while in dogs in the vineyard they can be even longer, there is however an in-fiction correspondence with the meta level of the conflict: the conflict is long because the scene is long, while in shock: there is no proportion between the time taken to do the math in a conflict and the actual narration of that conflict's outcome).<br/><br/>I don't think such an issue should have been taken so lightly, so this is also a criticism to those playtesters who do not consider it.<br/><br/>Hope this criticism somehow helps (and that my English was correct enough to make sense, lol).<br/>Cheers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308126/#Comment_308126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T04:36:26+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  4:36AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tazio; that is one very thorough and well thought critizism.

In that part, I am merely analizing the pattern that both Polaris and shock: bear. I also add that, depending on the game's premise, this could perfectly make sense.<br/><br/>Regarding the audience role... you're not the only one pointing that, Rafu also agrees on that. My point is. If it is so enjoyable, why giving it power to interfere with conflict? Because to me it kinda feels like they're given a very marginal role, and in order to compensate that, they are given the interfering power (for lack of a more elegant word). Of course this is merely how I perceive the issue. I may be completely mistaken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308130/#Comment_308130" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T04:51:30+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  4:51AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2011 4:57AM by GB_Steve.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think without the power to interfere, the impact on the fiction would just be waffle (or colour), instead it gains more currency than that because the fiction is used to justify and direct the interference. <br/><br/>So, for example, in our game whilst the Nuclear Scientist PC was debating with a local official about the shipping of waste products, the audience became the embodiment of 4Chan, commenting in real time on the debate, as if they were watching it on TV. At one point the Scientist got cross and became the 4Chan meme Angry Science Guy ("Dammit, man!" ::punches palm with fist::). Given that we'd backed him in the fiction, we could hardly go against him with our rolls. This also lead to a brief period as a media star for the Scientist in a future scene.<br/><br/>I also like the idea that the *tagonists don't fully control the outcome of their interaction. By having outside influences, it makes it more real and expands the conflict into other areas and builds the wider fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308131/#Comment_308131" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T05:01:03+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  5:01AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2011 6:31AM by Suna.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I actually like that idea.

Even novels that follow multiple characters tend to have only one viewpoint character at any given time. That's the Protagonist. There is no reason that stories can't cross. The Protagonist in one scene might be the Antagonist to another Protagonist in another. Or he might come on stage as an Audience-played character in another scene.<br/><br/>The Antagonist player should be inviting Audience players to play the roles of additional characters in the scene. The Audience is there to play any role that isn't already taken by the Antagonist. Also, the Audience is responsible for judging which Praxis is in effect and which side of the Praxis a Protagonist or Antagonist is using in a particular conflict. <br/><br/>As for Minutiae, the final say on it does not lie with the Protagonist or Antagonist, but with the owner of the Shock or Issue. <br/><br/>I haven't found the conflict procedure taking very much time at all. Once you've done it a few times, it's actually extremely quick and smooth. The only time it takes extra time is if one player (or both) hit their Fulcrum and the conflict escalates. But then it's worth spending an extra 30 seconds to make sure the escalation is exciting to everyone. Even then, time is spent looking at the consequences. The actual mechanical reading of the dice outcomes takes a couple of seconds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Downtime is often used for in between sessions, or rules-specific in Burning Empires fx. We tend, in rpgs, to talk about handling time, ie. the time you need to interact with the rules, but this is not in itself a negative thing.

Well, games do tend to have a flow, it's what you usually enjoy in a game. See how things change. Breaking that flow in order to make calculations, if those are perceived as unnecessarily long, tends to be regarded as not positive in a boardgame. Hence the immense success of german wave games and their nearly seamless flow. That's the functionality issue. Doing math is often necessary as long as it functional in spurring flow of the game and does not disrupt it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308213/#Comment_308213" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T12:20:51+00:00" title="January 14, 2011 12:20PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Non-interacting parallel stories bother me as well - it's like playing 3 2-player games simultaneously.

His stake is to rob me, my stake is to escape. we narrate how we come to this conflict before rolling dice of course.

Not a pause, no creativity, only stopping to apply the game's math.<br/>it's a hiccup. It can last minutes (hopefully it should be very quick, but \u201chopefully\u201d and \u201cin reality\u201d not always coincide). I\u2019ve never seen the part that starts after the declaration of stakes and ends before conflict outcome is narrate last less than 5 minutes. <br/>What does this conflict tell me? It gives me a yes/no information. I get/I don\u2019t get the stake. There\u2019s no HP adjustment, no resource loss/gain unless I put my links at risk (but for the sake of this example, let us assume a basic conflict that does not escalate and whose outcome is accepted by the entire table).

I think that, ideally--and tell me if you disagree, Joshua--in an ideal world, the resolution mechanic would be engaged silently, quickly, unobtrusively, and be over so fast as to let us keep playing, while still preserving all the interesting choices built into it. Right? So every mechanic is somewhere on the spectrum from too simple to too complex and involved, but every game needs a minimum amount of interesting features to make it interesting, or we'd just all be flipping coins in all our games.<br/><br/>So, first, we need to find the games that hit our "sweet spot" in terms of how complex/elegant the mechanics are. That's a personal taste thing, right?<br/><br/>Second, we always strive to find the most elegant means of resolving mechanical issues while maintaining the interesting choices we want or need in our games.<br/><br/>And on that point, we quickly get to:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>&gt; There has to be a better way (but honestly, I haven't thought of one).</blockquote>\n...right? Because that's the crux. Every designer's game is "the best way they could think of", at least at the time at which it was written, and assuming they put some care into it.<br/><br/>At least, that's how I see it, unless I'm completely misunderstanding this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308311/#Comment_308311" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T17:54:54+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  5:54PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea that handling time is a bad thing is questionable.

The overall payoff is a combination of the goodness of the mechanic and badness of the downtime. Maybe the overall payoff is great, amazing, fantastic - the downtime component of that sum is still negative. Maybe I love fiddling with dice and writing down numbers - if I could get that love without spending the time I would, the downtime component is negative. The counterfactual identical mechanic with no downtime is much better and it's a good idea to look to see if such a mechanic exists while designing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308379/#Comment_308379" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-15T13:16:51+00:00" title="January 15, 2011  1:16PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The issue of "downtime" in Shock: (and it is a real issue) is the same issue as exists in almost all stakes-setting games. Here's what I see the problems being:<br/><br/>a) There's uncertainty about when to engage the resolution mechanic. Has a conflict started yet or not? Sometimes, especially with talking conflicts, you're halfway through the conflict before you realise that you should be rolling dice.<br/><br/>b) Deciding what the stakes are takes time. Often there's negotiation, and that negotiation takes place outside of the fiction of the game. This problem is sometimes worse in Shock: because you have to decide on two non-contradictory sets of stakes, which isn't always easy.<br/><br/>c) Often if your resolution system is complex, it takes time to resolve who won which stakes. If resolution doesn't add more than yes/no to the fiction, this can feel like wasted time. I actually think Shock: is fairly economical in this regard.<br/><br/>d) Incorporating the results of the resolution into the fiction is often complex. If resolution assigns narration, that can be a help, but often there's a pause as people unpick the ramifications of what has been resolved (Shock:'s double-stakes can add to that).<br/><br/>e) Throughout, there's often an issue where it's not clear who is supposed to be talking, who has responsibility for deciding when there is a conflict, and how you arrive at good stakes. I think Shock: is better than many games in clarifying these issues, but they still exist.<br/><br/>In other words, I think Shock: uses the best technology that was available at the time it was written. These problems are more-or-less present in Dogs in the Vineyard, Legends of Alyria, Cold City, and a lot of other well-regarded games that use stakes-setting as part of resolution.  I expect that Human Contact will contain a lot of advances that will help with the above issues, based on Joshua's evolving understanding of how to play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308833/#Comment_308833" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T04:51:26+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  4:51AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All good points which I failed to address, Simon, thanks for your precious contribution.<br/>Yes, orthogonal stakes (as we call the stakes that do not contradict each other) can be tricky. Another problem I should have pointed in shock: is how anti-intuitive the praxis scale system is. It's not like in Trollbabe, where it's always the same for all players. Each game of shock: has new scales, sometimes it's not too intuitive to choose which one you're using (i've often seen negotiation on that, too), and not always it's easy to keep in mind whether you're rolling higher or lower than the scale, especially for the audience which has to choose how to influence the conflict. <br/>Non-intuitive rules can be a tricky and cause a major downtime, indeed. You're losing time (not resting) trying to figure things out mechanically, if it lasts too long.<br/><br/>And yeah, I agree with your conclusions, at least partly. I think that the playtesting process should have pointed at least a couple of these issues (I only ran one playtest session with my game, and all similar issues were immediately pointed). So it's strange that this didn't happen with shock. This is a (constructive, in my intention) criticism to playtesters, too. We'll see how Human Contact is, for sure. I'm curious to try it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
