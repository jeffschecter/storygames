Nobody NEEDS one.<br/><br/>Then, if someone who didn't get one thinks of one in the first hour or so of play, they can have it then. Or hell, whenever. As long as they don't insist on a do-over because NOW they thought of one they could have used THEN, no harm done.<br/><br/>This applies to you too! You never need to spend one second agonizing over a particular strength. Take them only when they pop out at you.<br/><br/>Oh just to be clear: this is my advice to you, not me pronouncing on the rules. All my advice here is legit by the rules (or close enough, in the case of "or hell, whenever"). But it doesn't encompass the entirety of what's legit by the rules. For instance, it's also legit for everybody to get one and for you to agonize over them, I just don't recommend it to you.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160353/#Comment_160353" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-02T07:53:27+00:00" title="August  2, 2008  7:53AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just try to avid thinking of one-trick abilities.

If they say, "I bake a delicious cake for Jerry," then clearly, something is amiss. Instead of arguing, though, asking for details and asking how is a good way to dig deeper. "You bake a cake? How is that violent?" If they have an answer, it might be awesome. Playing the standards-cop ("All use of Forms must be approved by me!") is much less fun, in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160553/#Comment_160553" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T06:10:56+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  6:10AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2008 6:11AM by fnord3125.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, turns out i totally agree.  and probably misread your previous post slightly.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I think I thought you said "<i>Don't</i> ask for details."<br/>Not that I've perfected this method yet.

I'm baking the cake so he'll let me past the guards."  A brief discussion is pretty natural.<br/><br/>Or they might go "I dunno" and try to think of something, and if a couple of seconds past and they're still thinking too hard, then you suggest "Perhaps different forms are needed if you want to bake the cake." Or maybe you have a sense that they want to be selfish and violent, they were just grasping with the action: "Perhaps there's another way to be selfish and violent". The emphasis is on brief discussions.  If they still can't settle on clear intentions after no more than a minute, it might be that they don't really have a conflict, and were just making assumptions that since they were in the scene, they needed to roll the dice at some point.  So, you can always pose "Okay, lets say you bake the cake. There's no conflict in that, and we go to a new scene.

Thus, you've already committed to your dice. Half the time, as GM, I just tell you which dice to pick up, if you haven't already done it ("okay! Directly and with violence, go!"). Sometimes more than one combination might fit, and then it's your choice, so I'll ask ("so that's with love, for others, and covertly, yeah? Your choice which two").<br/><br/>If you're going to roll a particular strength, you need to have already included it in saying what your character does ("I stab you in the face, screaming the names of the jackal spirits!").<br/><br/>If you haven't already said concretely what your character's doing, picking up dice at all is premature. Here's my current favorite example: "I get your sandwich from you! Directly and for myself!" "Like hell - wait, I mean, how?" "I offer you five bucks for it!" "Oh. I don't try to stop THAT."<br/><br/>So that's the first key moment. Since the dice follow the action, you should never run into cases where the action doesn't match the dice. If you do, stop and go back, establish the action first.<br/><br/>The other key moment when you pick up dice is when I say what MY character does, and YOURS can and will try to interfere. This is the more complicated case, because you haven't already said what your character's going to do. Here's how it can go:<br/><br/>"I stab you in the face! Directly, with violence!"<br/><br/>1. If the dice you pick up are obvious, nobody's going to ask you to justify them. "Like hell. I'm going to roll directly and with violence too." "Makes sense."<br/><br/>2. If you feel like it, you can say a sentence to set up your choice of dice. "Like hell. If you get past me that means EVERYBODY's screwed. I'm going to roll for others and for myself." "Makes sense."<br/><br/>3. If anybody asks you to justify your choice of dice, you have to, or choose different dice. "Like hell. I'm going to roll for others and for myself." "Really? How do you figure?" "If you get past me, that means EVERYBODY's screwed." "Oh, sure, makes sense."<br/><br/>4. Even if nobody asks you to justify your dice, have a plan. The reason they didn't ask is because they're trusting you, don't screw around with them. "Like hell. I'm going to roll covertly and with love." "Yeah? This I gotta see."<br/><br/>5. If you don't have a plan, be prepared to revise your action after you've rolled until it fits your dice. Fair's fair. How come you're screwing around like that?<br/><br/>All 5 go for particular strengths, too, exactly the same. <br/><br/>Now, here's a wicked important thing. This matters most during the first round of the action sequence, and it matters most for the person who wins initiative - for the first action of the first round. The further you get from the opening action of the opening round, the less commitment your choice of dice represents. KEEP ROLLING THE SAME DICE, unless you negotiate otherwise, no matter what you have your character do. When you answer, and when you go on to round 2 and round 3 - a mismatch between what your character does and what dice you roll doesn't matter a bit. <br/><br/>You're stuck - or blessed - with the dice you opened with, no matter where the action sequence takes you (again, unless you negotiate otherwise).<br/><br/>Make sense?

Don't argue, is what I'm saying. I think asking someone to justify their choice is lame, and I will knife fight a man who says otherwise.<br/><br/>GM choosing the dice is good, though. Cuts to the point and I like a strong GM in the Wicked Age.
