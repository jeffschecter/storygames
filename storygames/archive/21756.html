                    So, I've started playing Brickquest <a href="http://www.brickquest.com/brickquest/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.brickquest.com/brickquest/</a> with my students. For those who don't know me, I'm an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teacher and applied linguist. I have used roleplaying games with my intermediate students, usually middle schoolers and older, with good succeed in terms of language improvement and making learning English fun. Roleplaying is really the gold-standard of language teaching methods, and game playing makes the activity engaging, so roleplaying games are a perfect fit.<br/><br/>Recently, I have been trying to lower the bar of entry for my lower-level students.  Brickquest has been rolling around in my mind for a long time.  It's perfect because I can teach with all the parts, the built places and things.  And as a teaching tool, the game itself and block toys (e.g. LEGO) generally, offer a lot flexibility and teaching opportunities (English for math, etc.).  And it's visual and tactile! For lower-level students, this is a key advantage.  That is, the realia (i.e. props) dramatically support the language learning.<br/><br/>So, a few weeks ago, I decided to drop the Brickquest bomb, as it were.  I had a tutoring session with a father and son, both low level.  And I introduced Brickquest as learning activity. It took a hell-of-a-lot of preparation on my part to build a five-room dungeon, but they were thrilled! It was an awesome teaching moment.  I've done the same with another group of low-intermediate, grade-four students.  The same excitement and engagement with learning English happened.  So, I'm pretty commited to making this work on a grander scale.  <br/><br/>That's the background.<br/><br/>Here's the question.  The author of Brickquest, Peter F. Guenther, calls Brickquest "a game of small-scale fantasy combat similar to HeroQuest, Warhammer Quest, or MageKnight Dungeons" just with LEGO instead of cardboard cut-out. That has got me asking myself questions.  What exactly is the difference between OD&amp;D and Chainmail?  I'm using this comparison because in my mind Brickquest most resembles a game somewhere between those two.  What were the features of OD&amp;D that made it a RPG and not just a fantasy skirmish-game?  I hope these don't sound like stupid questions, but I am really mentally-blocked.  When we play Brickquest, the characters have names, and classes, and abilities.  I ask the players what their characters are doing.  There are systems for resolving actions not just combat.  There are in-game motivations for the player-characters to act (treasure and danger). There is even a little story (quest) for the dungeon `module' that provides a history for the dungeon and motivations for the characters (so I've added a little to the RAW, but I think this is just a nature extention of building the dungeon in the first place).  And there are risks and rewards for the characters.<br/><br/>Please, barf forth the theory but make it applicable to this situation.  This is a real design question, that needs a fairly quick answer.  I'd really like to turn Brickquest into a genuine RPG (ultimately for the benefit of my students' further advancement), but I can't for the life of me figure out what I am missing. What transforms a tactical simulation mini-game into a fully featured RPG? Have I already bridge the gap?  Am I too fixated on the author's definition of the game? Or have I missed something crucial?<br/><br/>Of course, I'll be happy to answer any question to clarify this post, and how I am using this game to teach.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for you help! <br/><br/> </div>

                            In short, and perhaps so obviously that I'm missing the point of your question, I'd say it's the fact that you do things other than fight (and can even proactively avoid fighting if you so wish), whereas I cannot think of a skirmish combat game where choosing the option to not-fight would do anything other than result in you not playing the (majority of the) game<br/><br/>In long and meandering and vague and equivocating...<br/><br/>The fact that these actions also ostensibly take place "in-character" is also often touted as a significant defining feature of a roleplaying game--that you don't just pick items off a list and compare them to a predetermined point value when outfitting your character, for example, but actually go to the store and reach into your beltpouch and pull out the coins and hand them to the shopkeep, maybe even haggle. However in many cases this is little more than a veneer, and I've heard countless tales of shopping trips in RPGs that are just the former rather than the latter, while people still contend that they are playing an RPG.<br/><br/>One of the troubles of an overly "structuralist" approach to analyzing games, I think, is that at a logical extreme everything starts to break down into system (to paraphrase a point Ron Edwards always seems to like to harp on, even seemingly arbitrary "do what seems best" freeform decision making is informed by some sort of underlying rules); the process by which my fighter goes to a store and purchases a new long sword isn't really different whether we play it out or whether I just look through the rule book and pick it off a list, presuming any kind of significantly complex restrictions on what choices and/or outcomes are available in either case.<br/><br/>If that's the case, then the only thing that really differentiates "RPG" play from other kinds of structured play is the introduction of fictional content that's not strictly necessary to the structure, and/or whose point is even to blur the structure itself, and/or coexists as the structure. All games involve the creation of wire frames, but "roleplaying" is covering them in papier mache: it fills in gaps, usually meaningfully so for the people doing it, but any significantly advanced wire frame can still make the object you're sculpting discernible without the facade, and indeed, a complex, densely-packed enough wire frame basically results in the same effect at least as far as creating a solid surface area. It's less a difference of function than it is one of form.<br/><br/>But to think of things in another, probably much more charitable way, Vincent Baker in <a href="https://twitter.com/lumpleygames/status/968181169907994624" rel="nofollow">a really excellent spurt of tweets</a> talked about the difference between real things and fictional things in games and the ways in which they interact. The way the label of RPG is traditionally applied, I think, is reflective of a certain degree to which the "fictional things affect real things" becomes significant in a game, once we start to agree that (I'm not doing this on purpose I swear) "fiction matters."<br/><br/>One popular example/thought experiment/gotcha question I see with some regularity is, "If I can imagine that chess pieces are real individual engaging in a fictional battle, why isn't chess an RPG?" But it absolutely can be, it's just that the vast majority of people don't play it that way. If both my opponent and I in a game of chess decide that the White King's Knight is having an affair with the Black Queen and we play a game of chess based on what we think that might mean, to explore the fictional consequences of it, then it absolutely becomes an RPG as far as I'm concerned.                        </div>

                            Loud, nerd-elitist wargamers in the 1970s hating on the New Thing is really the big difference.:D<br/><br/>Wargamers didn't like fantasy skirmish, one character games and thought they were dumb, kiddie, play pretend activities. OTOH their wargames were awesome intellectual exercises and historically accurate simulations. Therefore, a new name was needed, so that D&amp;D cooties wouldn't get on their hobby, and they forced fans of D&amp;D ( and similar sorts of gaming) to get a new name.<br/><br/>That's pretty close to the entire difference.<br/><br/>Things have blossomed a bit since then.                        </div>

                            Your problem is probably that you're trying to compare a term of cultural history (wargame) with an analytical term (roleplaying game). A term like "wargame" or "Heroquest type skirmish combat boardgame" refers to a historical game genre. When you start asking about "what makes a game roleplaying game" you're clearly not thinking in cultural terms anymore: you're asking for a rpg theory answer. The analytical and historical terminologies overlap heavily because the terms are independent of each other: a game being a "Heroquest-like" does not correlate with it being a "roleplaying game" in the analytical sense of the term, which means that a given game might or might not be a roleplaying game in that regard.<br/><br/>That is: when the creator of Brickquest calls it "a game like Heroquest" and you interpret this as "not a roleplaying game", you two might be discussing different conceptual spheres: Mr. Guenther is saying that "this game is in the genre of adventure boardgame", but what you're hearing is that "this game is not analytically speaking a full-fledged rpg". However, a game can be <i>both</i> an adventure boardgame and a rpg at the same time!<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I think that the simplest analytical definition for a "roleplaying game" is simply that it's a game that queries the<br/><b>shared imagined space<br/>narrative overlay<br/>fiction the players create</b><br/>as part of the process of play. <i>Monopoly</i> might have a story about a dog or a top hat that owns the city, but that story never matters for the gameplay. <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> is the opposite, the fictional details are queried constantly to find out stuff that the players feed into the rules mechanics.<br/><br/>So if you want an analytical answer to how to turn Brickquest into a roleplaying game, then that's it: figure out how the game's fiction should impact its mechanics, and make it so. Once there is a consistent and important connection, it's a full-fledged roleplaying game, no question.<br/><br/>On the other hand, cultural history: "roleplaying game" might well be understood as "a game that is like Dungeons &amp; Dragons", particularly in comparison to other types of wargames. So to be a roleplaying game you need to have a gamemaster, and every player runs a single character, and the game preferably involves party-based gameplay in a dungeon. Video games constantly use the term in this sense - your average CRPG has no shared imagined space, yet they are nevertheless called roleplaying games because you run a single character (or a party of named individuals at the most) through a dungeon that is overall rather similar to how D&amp;D works.<br/><br/>If you're concerned about the cultural history, I'd say that Brickquest, just like Heroquest, is already a "roleplaying game" in that sense. The fact that it has somewhat more mechanical rules than D&amp;D seems entirely incidental in the big picture - it's certainly not any other subgenre of wargame.<br/><br/>Incidentally: when discussing the subgenre of tabletop gaming that Heroquest and D&amp;D both belong in, we often call it "adventure game". As one might imagine, this is less confusing than calling it "roleplaying game in the sense of cultural similarity to D&amp;D" [grin]. This way we can retain "roleplaying game" exclusively as an analytical term of art. We can say things like "Heroquest is an adventure game like D&amp;D, but it is not a roleplaying game".

Yeah, that's already a roleplaying game if you want it to be. It can only manage to be a non-roleplaying game if you answer fictionally reasonable player suggestions with "no can do, that's not in the rules". If you facilitate fiction-based problem-solving where appropriate, it's clearly a roleplaying game.                        </div>

In terms of cultural history, yes. But if we're just looking for a technical definition, then anything that works in the rpg medium is a rpg, regardless of its heritage of influence. This means that some wargames are definitely also roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Roleplaying is so young as an artistic medium that the name of the medium itself is usually the same as the name of the most dominant historical tradition. Both "games that derive from D&amp;D" and "games that query the shared imagined space" are called "roleplaying games". This can cause some confusion when it comes to something like say BDSM roleplaying, which is not derived from D&amp;D, or Heroquest, which is derived from D&amp;D but does not utilize a SIS.<br/><br/>In my younger years I used to have quite a chip on my shoulder about this terminology stuff. A futile example is that I rather dislike calling computer rpgs "rpgs", as this feels like ignorant cultural appropriation by stupid computer gamers who don't know what a real roleplaying game is like. Ultimately, though, it is what it is, and understanding the word "roleplaying game" primarily in cultural heritage terms rather than as an analytical description isn't any worse a way to choose your words.                        </div>

                            Skirmish wargames inevitably develop an element of fiction around them because you're telling a story about some individuals fighting each other and some survive and some die horribly.  It's almost impossible not to anthropomorphize the little guys, whether they're represented by minis or cardboard chits or whatever. You see the same effect with X-Com, Frostgrave, any other game where you have individual guys.<br/><br/>Roleplaying starts when the fiction starts to have effects on game play beyond just whatever's on the hex map.  This warrior is going to attack the wizard because the wizard just killed his friend, that sort of thing.  It's a spectrum and it goes from just being a fun thing you do with your skirmish wargame to being the most important part of the game, with the skirmish part just coming out to resolve tactical parts of the story.  <br/><br/>The Fantasy Trip is getting Kickstarted right now and provides some interesting ways to test this hypothesis, since if you back it, you get the original boxed skirmish games MELEE and WIZARD as well as the full TFT system.  Apparently a common way to introduce people to the system is to run them through a brief skirmish, and then add the extra rules on top of the fighty ones they've just learned.                         </div>

                            A lot of the major wargames in the 1960's (Bath, Featherstone, Barker, the Blackmoor group, pretty much every Diplomacy zine) were actually roleplaying games.

In terms of cultural history, yes. But if we're just looking for a technical definition, then anything that works in the rpg medium is a rpg, regardless of its heritage of influence. This means that some wargames are definitely also roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Roleplaying is so young as an artistic medium that the name of the medium itself is usually the same as the name of the most dominant historical tradition. Both "games that derive from D&amp;D" and "games that query the shared imagined space" are called "roleplaying games". This can cause some confusion when it comes to something like say BDSM roleplaying, which is not derived from D&amp;D, or Heroquest, which is derived from D&amp;D but does not utilize a SIS.<br/><br/>In my younger years I used to have quite a chip on my shoulder about this terminology stuff. A futile example is that I rather dislike calling computer rpgs "rpgs", as this feels like ignorant cultural appropriation by stupid computer gamers who don't know what a real roleplaying game is like. Ultimately, though, it is what it is, and understanding the word "roleplaying game" primarily in cultural heritage terms rather than as an analytical description isn't any worse a way to choose your words.</div></blockquote>
This seems like a very unusual argument to me. Anything can be examined historical terms, and anything can be examined through an analytical description. RPGs are something that emerged historically from war-games. Saying the term only belongs in the analytical category, yet war-games somehow can be dealt with in both...either I am misunderstanding what you are saying or there is a deeply flawed assumption going on. But further, I think you are missing a bigger point and equivocating quite a bit here. The term RPG, as applied to video games, is a different category than RPG applied to things like D&amp;D (or BDSM). When people use this word in these different contexts, they mean very different things. A lot of words carry different meanings depending on the context they are used in (and sometimes they will have a shared or overlapping history but that doesn't make them the same thing). But we shouldn't use that shifting meaning to distort what people are trying to say when they use the term "RPG". <br/> </div>

                            I, on the other hand, would say that there is technically a sliver of the fundamental quality of the roleplaying game in that skirmish game. If players doing deduction from the imagined space (that the playing pieces happen to represent and track) doesn't make a roleplaying game, then what is it that makes D&amp;D one? I only see a difference in the amount of fiction-based play, not its quality.<br/><br/>I remember doing a little rpg theory lecture over a decade ago at a Finnish convention where I argued that the various theory traditions seem to essentially use three different definitions for what "roleplaying game" even means. This was interesting because of how the three definitions all overlap with each other, but none is a strict subset of the others either - it is as if theorists in these different schools aren't even talking about the same thing when they say "roleplaying game".<br/><br/>The three definitions I examined then are as follows:<br/><br/><b>Immersionist</b> definition of roleplaying game is that every player has their own imaginary character, and the players play-act these characters. According to this definition D&amp;D originally was not really a roleplaying game, but that roleplaying was discovered by playing D&amp;D relatively early on. Wacky story games that don't have individually appointed characters (Universalis, Microscope, etc.) are not roleplaying games in the proper sense as per this definition - they are something else. On the other hand, CRPGs like World of Warcraft can very easily be roleplaying games in the immersionist sense.<br/><br/><b>Traditionalist</b> definition of roleplaying game is that it's a tabletop game in the tradition of D&amp;D. Being a "real" roleplaying game is a matter of hitting enough distinguishing marks, not being too different. A typical list of defining features would include having a GM, individual characters, being played narratively, etc. Something that does not build upon the tradition is no longer a roleplaying game. This definition usually excludes e.g. therapeutic roleplaying and computer games and larping - their having some similarities in certain technical aspects with roleplaying is not as significant as the fundamental differences are, so a proper traditionalist theory does not worry about this sort of fringe phenomena.<br/><br/><b>Formalist</b> definition is the one I offered upthread, because I think it's most to the point for practical and theoretical purposes: a game is a "roleplaying game" if it is played by querying a shared imagined space - particularly, if it <i>cannot</i> be played without doing it, and the fiction is the most <i>important</i> part of the game state, then there need be no doubt. This definition includes all sorts of hypothetical non-game social rituals into roleplaying, as does the immersionist definition, but it does require a social encounter as a fundamental cornerstone - unlike immersion, you cannot do a shared imagined space alone.<br/><br/>Ultimately we don't have anything better than this for having grungy debates about "what is a roleplaying game" - you just pick your favourite definition, or think up your own, and start complaining about people who disagree [grin].                        </div>

I would be rather surprised if the first CRPGs weren't called just that simply because they were aping D&amp;D: a dungeoneering premise, monsters and treasure, adventurers who have statistics, turn-based combat and so on. The similarities are sort of obvious.<br/><br/>The distinction between CRPGs and "adventure games" was a very early one, too: although the literary subject matter could be basically identical (an adventurer exploring a cave), what seems to have made a game "RPG" in the minds of the '70s video gamers was the presence of an individualized character stat line, and possibly the presence of grinding round-based combat. A CRPG was, in a word, more "mathy" than an adventure game. I basically never see anybody call something like say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure" rel="nofollow">Adventure</a> a "roleplaying game".                        </div>

                            Eero, I've always taken the mathyness of CRPGs to be really significant in defining them, even if there doesn't seem to be anything on the surface about making mathematical calculations that would seem to correlate to what we consider the "role playing" part of RPGs.<br/><br/>Something about the way they lay bare the underlying systems, as opposed to keeping them hidden from the player, from converting them into some other representational system. The level of feedback it provides to the player about their choices (regardless of how limited or not those choices are), and how that directness changes the way they relate to the game as a whole is, I think, a key part of the sort of understanding the thinking that lumps them together.<br/><br/>Perhaps paradoxically this level of granular, bare mechanical structure is something that people who would probably be grouped under your Immersionist tradition would declare they find off-putting in analog roleplaying games. Not that I mean that as a discredit to the concept by any means; if history has taught us anything it's that different people are able to relate to the same game in often radically different ways <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <br/><br/>"Interface"--both in the concept of the character and how it's represented to the player--seems to be something that's at play there, I think.                        </div>

                            As a Generation X'er, I can confidently say that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry" rel="nofollow">Wizardry</a> was huge in the development from TTRPG to CRPG -- it was basically a D&amp;D dungeon crawl on your home computer in 1981.  The addictive, obsessive nature of all dungeon crawls of clearing one more room/one more level/leveling up one more time was all there. <br/><br/>All the fun story-game stuff was missing, of course.  I think that's why the first Wizardry game was called "Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord" -- it was supposed to be sort of a practice dungeon that adventurers could delve into to get experience before they went out into the world (which didn't actually exist in the game). <br/><br/>EDIT: Reading the Wikipedia page I linked to, it notes that the Wizardry games remained big in Japan long after they'd faded in the USA and were very influential on the development of Japanese CRPG's, even including silly jokes like the "Blade of Cusinart" that weren't recognized as jokes.                         </div>

I agree the history is there. That doesn't mean the word means the same thing though when it crosses mediums. My point was, when someone who is thinking WOW says they want to play an RPG, they have something very different in their mind from someone who is thinking D&amp;D or GURPS and says the same thing.                         </div>
