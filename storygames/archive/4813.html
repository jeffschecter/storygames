Everybody has the same number of cards and the same number of opportunities to apply their cards.  High cards win.  In practice the spread evens out for the most part, and you win about as often as you lose, but there is some uncertainty in every outcome.  It's also jazzed up with some interesting choices, but at the simplest level, it's not a very engaging system - just an uncertain one on the individual conflict level.  I <i>suspect </i>that players will freight conflicts with meaning and use valuable or worthless cards accordingly, but that won't have any impact on the system itself.<br/><br/>Part of me likes this, because it de-emphasizes the conflict in favor of the outcome, but I have nagging doubts.  It's not as satisfying as chucking a big pile of dice, you know?  And if the outcome is all I care about, why randomize at all?  <br/><br/>What do you think, Internet people?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108069/#Comment_108069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T07:36:41+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  7:36AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually was thinking about this in recent weeks, but probably not in the same terms as you. As a game master I want player characters to fail in dramatic but not game breaking ways, but I ultimately want them to succeed more than they fail, and for their successes to outweigh their failures (so in the end they have gained).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a player I want control over my failure the same way I want control over my success. That is one of the reasons in recent years why I've had problems with a pass/fail style game. I want degrees of success and failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I bring this up in the context of randomness is, I find games with the most random elements also tend to be pass/fail. How many times have you come up with a master plan only to blow the die roll? I think a lot of people think this simulates reality (there is always a chance of pulling the wrong wire, no matter how trained you are, and if you had no idea what you were doing you still have a chance of pulling the correct wire), but i don't play for the reality, I play for the drama and excitement and escape. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm always torn between having the thrill of randomness in a game versus having control over the story and my character. Why play a game where I never can do the cool things I want to do. A truly random game kinda plays itself, and again doesn't seem that fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108070/#Comment_108070" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T07:38:05+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  7:38AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and to add to that, with the element of uncertainty, I don't want to enter every conflict and know I am going to win.

If you pay attention, you can see what the other players have spent and plan accordingly.  That game-within-a-game can be fun.<br/><br/>The thing to make sure of is to have it so that players don't just save their highest/most powerful cards for the Big Money Shot at the end. In El Grande, frex (only using that as an example because it's the same mechanism, and IIRC you've played before) there's a lot to gain with using higher cards first: Taking initiative early on gets you the chance to lay down some foundational work that can prove pivotal later on.<br/><br/>Also, there's the fact that the power of the card (in El Grande, that is) was counterbalanced by the fact that the more powerful/higher cards gained you less "bankable resources".

You keep the randomness, but give players a (costly) resource to bump the odds in their favor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108078/#Comment_108078" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T08:28:51+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  8:28AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In retrospect, I suppose I have a pretty cynical relationship with uncertainty- I favor randomness in a game, but I'm willing to cheat to tell a good story...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108080/#Comment_108080" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T08:34:41+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  8:34AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>It's also worth noting that "randomness" might really just be the thrill of the unknown in general- not knowing what cards my opponent has in his hand or what cards I might get from the deck can create excitement, even if it's fixed.</blockquote>To expand on this slightly, in the abstract games community at Yahoo!, they define abstract games as games of perfect information (Chess and Go being famous examples) and consider information generated by randomizers to be just a special category of hidden information -- it's just hidden from <em>all</em> the players until it is generated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108090/#Comment_108090" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T09:26:21+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  9:26AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite>To expand on this slightly, in the abstract games community at Yahoo!, they define abstract games as games of perfect information (Chess and Go being famous examples) and consider information generated by randomizers to be just a special category of hidden information -- it's just hidden from<em>all</em>the players until it is generated.</blockquote>\nOK, that's interesting.

A failure that could happen at any time seemingly out of your control can build up over time.  Another way, which needn't be random, is a "clock ticking down" mechanic, but that has to be balanced right in order to work.  Another way is to present overwhelming choice in the face of doom -- I've played many chess games that have been rather tense, because in the endgame I have around a dozen choices that might have been decent moves, but so does my opponent, so I have the mentally maneuver around him before I even lay hand to a piece.<br/><br/>I think randomness is probably the easiest way to create tension in an average situation, though.  Maybe not the most rewarding, but the easiest to work with.  Of course, so can the illusion of randomness, if you don't let on that it's all a facade.<br/><br/>That's not to say that there aren't methods of randomness that aren't about tension, but when it comes to dice and other instantly-generated random artifacts, you have a neat thing happen:  you have hope from the player of rolling "high" or "well" (whatever that means for a given system).  You have cheering at Rolls of Awesomeness.  You have dashed hopes at critical failures.  If anything, the dice are less important to the game and more important as an object of emotional impact (though, without the game as a vehicle for that, it doesn't work).<br/><br/>Maybe that's why your system doesn't have the jazz you want?  The emotional impact of your randomness isn't there, because it's done during this preliminary period.  What you're left with in a game of unequal resource management in your RPG, rather than a game of chance.<br/><br/>Naturally, I'm probably talking out of my ass, but even typing this up has helped me sort out some thoughts about my own card-based game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108103/#Comment_108103" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T10:51:03+00:00" title="November 13, 2007 10:51AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>If you want to de-emphasize conflict, why have any sort of conflict resolution?</blockquote>  Hmm, that's a good question, at least for one part of the game.

Events and situations that would never have occurred to us, that surprised us, because of outlying resolution results we had to fit our brains around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system I'm wrestling with above is binary - two players put down cards, one wins, one loses, there are consequences related to the result. I guess I'm worried that it'll entirely lack that sense of tension that comes from surprising potential results.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the other way to view that is like fencing. Instead of each play of the cards being a win/lose, it could be considered an advantage/disadvantage. One gains ground, one loses ground. It's what you choose to do with that lost/gained ground that matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108186/#Comment_108186" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T21:28:45+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  9:28PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfortunately, Jason, the system you're suggesting is wrong.<br/><br/>(Um, anyway.)<br/><br/>Ron Edwards posted something on "The Ball", a long while ago, on the Forge.

Everybody has the same number of cards and the same number of opportunities to apply their cards.  High cards win.  In practice the spread evens out for the most part, and you win about as often as you lose, but there is some uncertainty in every outcome.  It's also jazzed up with some interesting choices, but at the simplest level, it's not a very engaging system - just an uncertain one on the individual conflict level.  I<i>suspect</i>that players will freight conflicts with meaning and use valuable or worthless cards accordingly, but that won't have any impact on the system itself.<br/><br/>Part of me likes this, because it de-emphasizes the conflict in favor of the outcome, but I have nagging doubts.  It's not as satisfying as chucking a big pile of dice, you know?  And if the outcome is all I care about, why randomize at all?<br/><br/>What do you think, Internet people?</blockquote>\nI'm a little fuzzy on how this works, and I don't see any clarification in the thread.  Here's what I'm assuming:<br/><br/>a) The deck is split between the players at the beginning of the game.<br/>b) Players play cards from their personal deck strategically (meaning they look at what they have in their hands and play according to their wishes in the conflict).<br/><br/>In that case, you're front-loading the randomization in the beginning when the deck is cut, but after that a player who so desires can figure out what cards everyone else has, and keep track during play.  Which means that there's not really a random element to the card playing, only the original deal.<br/><br/>The main consequence of this is someone might wind up with a really bad hand and know it.  Their only real choice, then, is to try and win conflicts that other players find insignificant.  Ability to frame conflicts is therefore VERY important, which you seem to want to avoid.<br/><br/>If you want it to be truly random, divide the deck, have each player shuffle before each draw, and play off the top without looking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108193/#Comment_108193" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T22:12:31+00:00" title="November 13, 2007 10:12PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite>If you want it to be truly random, divide the deck, have each player shuffle before each draw, and play off the top without looking.</blockquote>\nYou don't even need to divide the deck for that.

But enough about that.<br/><br/>There are (at least) three uses for randomizers between the fiction and the players: The first is the one you're talking about, where the randomizer determines a course of action <i>in lieu</i> of player choice - ie. players will never choose to fail unless the dice tell them they fail.  The next is determining whether the character is capable or competent enough to fulfill the action that the player has chosen.  And the third is determining outcome when a player choice is made without full knowledge.  In a lot of the games that get talked about here, the players have complete information (PTA) because the only information in the fiction is the information that the players create.  However, in order to simulate character action in a world where the players necessarily have incomplete information, there must be an opportunity that the player's choice (and character action) is going to bump up against hidden information.<br/><br/>In that case, randomizers are a good way to simulate that, and still have players making interesting character decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108221/#Comment_108221" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T05:30:02+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  5:30AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>How important is randomness and uncertainty?</blockquote>here's a little something that might be useful<br/><br/>I've read that people tend to over-estimate the danger associated with things they don't control (like an airline plane) and under-estimate that of things they do control (like their car)<br/><br/>so I'd say that people feel a stronger sense of "danger" when something is resolved randomly, even when there is not really that much danger involved<br/><br/>also, it's a fact that people tend to be fascinated by games of luck (roulette anyone?)<br/><br/>so I'm under the impression that just giving something a random element makes it "interesting" in itself<br/><br/>now, perhaps all depends on how much of the fun of your game you want to come from that side                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108230/#Comment_108230" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T06:59:09+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  6:59AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>it's a fact that people tend to be fascinated by games of luck (roulette anyone?)<br/><br/>so I'm under the impression that just giving something a random element makes it "interesting" in itself</blockquote>\nYeah, how did we get this far without talking about gambling?<br/><br/>Rolling dice is fun.

Like, say I'm playing d20, have a +7 modifier, and need to hit a target number 10.  Making someone roll for that seems silly.  But many systems are set up that way.  They start out with randomness, but that ends up being too random, so they narrow down the randomness until the outcomes fall within a very small acceptable range.  Seems like there are better tools for achieving those same results.<br/><br/>EDIT: In these cases, I would argue that randomness is being used more for the "thrill of possible danger" that folks above talked about, even though there is very little danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108250/#Comment_108250" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T10:31:27+00:00" title="November 14, 2007 10:31AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>but I am often frustrated when randomizers are used in a way that diminishes their randomness down to basically nothing.</blockquote>\nWould you see Fudge dice as an example of diminished randomness?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108255/#Comment_108255" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T10:46:02+00:00" title="November 14, 2007 10:46AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's kinda complicated, Ryan.

That's my principal concern - there's some room to fiddle about with the cards you are dealt, but on average everybody is going to be dealt more or less the same range of cards, and win more or less as many conflicts as they lose.  Skill definitely does not enter into it.  Personally I don't care overmuch about that, being more eager to get to the meat of the matter, which is what everybody does about success or failure.  But there's a point mechanic overlaid that determines a winner and a loser, and that's essential, and I've learned that when you have a competitive component, people will want to compete.  Who knew?  So that's an issue, since "competing" has little meaning in the system as it sits.  It may be really dumb, but I have a feeling that buffering the conflict so that you don't have a lot of control might actually be a strong choice.  Counter-intuitive, but it seems to work in Denmark.

Characters improve in consistency as much as in effectiveness.  What does this indicate?  That players have been socialized to the game enough so that play can now happen more deterministically, without being reinforced by random risks that channel behavior down the strategically "best" path?  Or is that part of what makes high-level play in D&amp;D less and less satisfying (or so my D&amp;D-playing friends tell me) because there is less and less chance of unexpected mechanical consequences, forcing people to rely completely on the GM and other players, who may not be used to providing that kind of unexpected challenge (because the game does it for them at low levels)?

This is particularly true if you consider all the 3.5 books as a whole, where there's a definite trend across the game's publishing life to put out more and more ways to remove randomness entirely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108269/#Comment_108269" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T12:09:34+00:00" title="November 14, 2007 12:09PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric, is that part of where the incentive to own more books and become more familiar with all the rules comes in?

I'd actually single out the remaining randomness as one of the most frustrating parts of high-level DnD, since single rolls of a d20 completely determine your fate with great frequency.<br/><br/>At lower-ish levels, combat rolls tend to have more time to average: sword swings are only rarely instant-kills against players, and failed saves against spells are more likely to apply debuffs or take away turns than cause a player to go play Portal for the next hour. At the lowest and highest levels, the reverse is true, and players have the constant potential to go from being in perfect condition to not playing for the next hour or more (at the lowest levels, coming back from the dead is not practical, while at high levels combat just takes that long to finish). <br/><br/>Anyway, that's one of the top complaints I hear on DnD forums, and it resonates with my own experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108273/#Comment_108273" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T12:23:47+00:00" title="November 14, 2007 12:23PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2007 12:26PM by Eric.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Eric, is that part of where the incentive to own more books and become more familiar with all the rules comes in?

Yeah?</blockquote>\nIt's definitely true that rules mastery leads to player empowerment in DnD. In my current Eberron game, coming up on session 30, I'm playing an Artificer, whose defining class feature is basically "access to every rule in the game." So, in any given situation, I actually have a huge amount of control over my fate, and how much of the spotlight I want to grab. Sometime I choose to destroy opposition by myself, and other times I hang back and play a supporting role, but it's almost always my choice. <br/><br/>It's honestly a huge moment for me whenever we're in a tight spot, I think for a minute, then pull out a MacGyver-esque combination of weird spells, items, and rules text that gets us clear. It's my step-on-up moment in that game, and it's completely dependent on my rules mastery. I should note that a "home run" for me here is a plan that has no real dependence on dice whatsoever, either because the dice are never used or because all the rolls are trivial (that's your plan? Okay roll d20+22 vs. DC 20... um, right, moving on...).<br/><br/>The person playing the druid has much less rules mastery, so, despite playing a very strong class, doesn't have as much of a mechanical voice at the table.<br/><br/>Leveling has a kind of perverse effect on player empowerment, in my experience, since the rewards are neither linear nor always a net gain. At any one level jump, some players might be seeing massive boosts in power and narrative authority, while others might actually be worse off against expected opposition than they were the previous level. Again, rules mastery is the order of the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108283/#Comment_108283" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T13:42:26+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  1:42PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgive me if this has been mentioned.
