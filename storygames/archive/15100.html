Our first session was great! Here are some things that I loved:<br/><br/>The group came up with an amazing setting \u2013 the action centers around a hardhold that is actually a giant predatory bus. Or, rather a bus and an RV and three shortbuses, all chained and bolted together. They go back and forth along a long route in what used to be Canada, pillaging and exacting tribute, but the pissant little holds along the way put up with it, because the bus (named \u201cThe 20\u201d for its former route number) bring goods and skills and news. Also, one of the PCs is a polygamist lady-chopper, whose biker gang consists of her 15 husbands, called \u201cThe Family\u201d.<br/><br/>This is 100% not what I was hoping/planning for, so I love it extra.<br/><br/>The second really great thing was how fucked-up the PCs turned out to be. We have a hardholder, chopper and brainer, and they are some black-nailed bastards. The hardholder keeps his citizens (the \u201cticket holders\u201d) in line with an iron fist, the brainer is a amoral gender-bender with a violent streak and the chopper killed one of the hardholder's gang just to prove a point.<br/><br/>It\u2019s tricky to keep them from spinning out of control into cartoonish villainy, but I think the players kept it tight. The characters weren\u2019t nice people at all, but they also seemed like the sort of people who could survive and thrive in a messed-up place. <br/><br/>In play, I was constantly shocked by their actions.<br/><br/># # #<br/><br/>The session went pretty smoothly, and I felt good about our interactions with the rules, but I\u2019d love to hear what the AW experts here think.<br/><br/>1. Mrs. Jenkins, the chopper PC, was in a village, attempting to get the dirt on whether or not they were threats, or had useful skills, so I had her \u201cRead A Person\u201d (she was talking to the leader). She failed, so my move was to have Kettle, an NPC, shoot a village child. Kettle was a member of the hardholder\u2019s gang, which is disciplined, but also savage, and he was tasked with searching the villagers tents. The kid was trying to hang onto some valuable goods. <br/><br/>Was my move too hard? Should I have set it up first? Or did that follow pretty logically from what we knew about Kettle?<br/><br/>2. Following that, Mrs. Jenkins  surprised me by bringing her machete down onto Kettle\u2019s NPC head. I had her roll Seizing By Force. From reading the AW forums, it seems like \u201cfighting\u201d is a tricky subject, and that felt sort-of-but-not-quite right. Would it have made more sense to just have her do it, no move?<br/><br/>3. The PCs decided that the bus runs on fusion power, so it\u2019s only fuel is water. At the time, I didn\u2019t even pick up on that being a problem, but in retrospect, it sucks, because that eliminates a good reason to fuck with them (ie \u2013 a pirate bus city needs a lot of fuel). The players would be fine if I just apologized, and retconned the fusion reactor. But I feel like maybe that is contrary to the spirit of AW. Should I just wait and mess it up with some MC moves (announce that it\u2019s acting weird as Future Badness, and then have it blow up as Taking Their Stuff)?<br/><br/>I\u2019m happy with whatever works in the game, and everything did, but I like to make sure I\u2019m not missing important stuff with a  new game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343393/#Comment_343393" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T12:02:52+00:00" title="September 20, 2011 12:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2011 12:05PM by mease19.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

In my AW-in-space game, I've found that hand-wavy tech is typically not very fun because it's hard to engage with both as players and MC.  If something breaks, it's often hard to describe how it's broken and how it could be fixed.  That said, impossible tech is cool as long as you draw a diagram of it and list a bunch of the major parts and show which pieces are liable to get busted or need regular replacements.  So, basically, the answer to impossible tech is <b>"make maps (i.e. schematics, in this case) like crazy."</b>  They give you the fictional context for moves and decisions to make sense.  EDIT: Yeah, sketchy schematics let you do what Jason is suggesting, but add a layer of honesty and prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343401/#Comment_343401" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T13:17:12+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  1:17PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2011 1:18PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

You could physically disappear into the maelstrom and pop out somewhere else. A wicked motherfucker named Rothschild had a temple in the wasteland that he used to "sacrifice" people by pitching them over to the other side of the maelstrom.

I somehow missed the part where we decided on a fusion reactor versus a "regular" old fission reactor for this.  Certainly either could cause problems, but I guess I like the highly-improbable story of an old Soviet-era sub (according to Wikipedia, the Soviet ones are extra accident-prone... bonus!) being dismantled and cannibalized to power this city-on-wheels rather than an impossible story of a technology that doesn't exist.  (Disclaimer: I know almost nothing about the technical aspects of any of this.)  Also, I'm now picturing some parts of the submarine still being part of the bus-thing, which just seems cool.<br/><br/>All of that said, the best reason to allow a retcon is that the whole nuclear-bus idea was me saying "dude, the bus should be nuclear-powered, that would be sweet!" I'm not 100% sure that the Hardholder, whose bus it is, was so into the idea.  It was an off-hand comment while other things where going on in the game.
