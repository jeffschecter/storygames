Two groups divided up, drew playsets out of a hat, and wrote fiasco stories in the Manna, Kansas and 30s New England settings. None of us had ever played before, but two of us had read the rules thoroughly.<br/><br/>In addition to normal set up, we also chose actors to portray our characters and made movie trailers at the end, to show off "highlights" of our sessions to one another. Both were strong stories, albeit the rules were a little hard to navigate for everyone the first time through (something we did not anticipate).<br/><br/>In my opinion, the New England story had a much better trailer (Manna, KS was a cross between Barton Fink, Big Lebowski, and Bottle Rocket) with John Leguizamo running down a road on fire within the first 10 seconds of the trailer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
