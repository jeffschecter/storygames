Not only do war games provide the requisite action many of us demand of our gaming, but they also open the door to interesting historical and moral/ethical questions.<br/><br/>When I was a young lad, the war to roleplay was Vietnam.  I grew up in a city filled with military bases and most of the kids I gamed with were the sons of veterans of that war, just as I'm sure many of our dads were the sons of WWII vets.  Vietnam was "our" war and, thanks to movies like <i>Rambo: First Blood, Part II</i>, we didn't have to stop fighting it in our imaginations just because it didn't go well for our side.<br/><br/>I suspect that the teens of the near future will fight and re-fight Afghanistan and Iraq in their games.  It's only natural, really.  You play what you know.  We already see it happening with the explosive popularity of stuff like <i>Call of Duty</i>.<br/><br/>Anyway, specificity seemed very important to us back in the '80s when I was playing those games of <i>Recon</i> or what have you.  There was [insert war] and we were telling stories about it.  That mindset seems to have kept with us \u2014 witness all those GURPS supplements involving WWII, for example \u2014 but I've noticed a few cases where the war under discussion doesn't have to be any particular war at all.  These games center around War as a concept, seeming to proceed from the assumption that all soldiers everywhere have a commonality of experience.<br/><br/>Right now I'm thinking about two games: <i>Shell Shock</i> and <i>Black Cadillacs</i>.  <i>Shell Shock</i> just comes right out and says it: "<i>Shell Shock</i> is a set of rules which will allow you to tell the stories of these soldiers. There are no predetermined setting. You can tell the stories of US soldiers confronted to the horrors of the Korean war or the lives of guerrilla fighters on the Polar front of the Mars independance [sic] war of 2135."  I have not seen a physical copy of <i>Black Cadillacs</i>, but I've read enough about it at this point that I'm sure it says something similar.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Until just today, I had not thought <i>carry. a game about war.</i> was of a piece with the previous two games.  I know <i>carry</i> only through the (fairly rudimentary) version posted to 1KM1KT and it's very much about the Vietnam War.  But Adam Dray said something in another thread about it: "<i>carry</i> doesn't really present a portrait of the Vietnam War at all. It's just a game about war in general. Any color or theme comes largely from us. I chose to set this particular game in the Battle of Hu\u1ebf just to try something a little different. I've never run a game of <i>carry</i> set in any particular place or on any specific date."<br/><br/>I find this very interesting.  There's certainly no shortage of games about specific wars \u2014 we even have <i>The Bloody Forks of the Ohio</i>, which involves the French and Indian War, which is about as "niche" as you can get when talking about American wars \u2014 but is there something more appealing about disconnecting our war stories from history and focusing on fictional conflicts?  I get that it may assuage the social and political flare-ups that might occur with an historical scenario, but are there other benefits?  Are we better off using <i>Shell Shock</i> to tell the story of "guerrilla fighters on the Polar front of the Mars independance [sic] war of 2135" than that of German soldiers in the siege on Stalingrad?  I honestly don't know, which is why I put it to you here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360569/#Comment_360569" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T13:33:42+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  1:33PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know some people have been playing 3:16 for a certain take on war, by re-skinning it to different settings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360575/#Comment_360575" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T14:03:07+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  2:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam!</cite>Are we better off using<i>Shell Shock</i>to tell the story of "guerrilla fighters on the Polar front of the Mars independance [sic] war of 2135" than that of German soldiers in the siege on Stalingrad?</blockquote>\nMaybe it depends on your agenda and your audience. I don't think there is a <i>better</i>, but there is always a use case in support of one or the other. <br/><br/>For example you mentioned <i>Bloody Forks of the Ohio,</i> which is stuffed with quasi-historical minutia but is far enough removed from what most people know about American history that it doesn't stir up history panic. And if it does, hey, lightning guns are optional. But one of my goals was to introduce players to an important corner of the American experience that is often overlooked. So using the same color for an amorphous frontier war somewhere wasn't an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360576/#Comment_360576" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T14:04:47+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  2:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The experience I've had with Carry is that it provides enough to present a "theme" or "backdrop" of Vietnam, but the mechanics aren't explicitly tied to that engagement.<br/>Carry is about the interconnect of the squads (or fire teams or what have you) and about the issues inside the characters.  I agree with Adam, it's essentially portable to any engagement, so long as you want to focus on the tension in the group, and build towards that eventual blowout.<br/><br/>The bonus is that it's been a hard blow to people that want to find glory in war, as they watch the game system focus on a different side of things, a more personal and often tragic side.<br/><br/>That's how my experience has been, but your mileage may certainly vary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360643/#Comment_360643" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T20:27:10+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  8:27PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2012 9:08PM by Noah_D.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edited heavily at the realization that I was repeating what Sam! said.]<br/><br/>Depends on your table. Cop-out answer, I know, but I think the possibilities of reactions to any particular choice of conflict and how it is presented obviate almost everything else.<br/><br/>Coming from a miniatures wargaming background, I've seen an interesting phenomena: 'I Won't Play...' It comes in many flavors: Nazis, Communists, The Confederate South, The Union North, Vietnam at all, any current conflict, Sci-Fi, Real History, The Man, Aliens, Specific Nazis (Wehrmacht OK, SS not so much), any conflict in living memory. Different things set off people's 'squick' factor. <br/><br/>A lot comes from the 'authors intent'. Is the game organizer/GM/table trying to 'make a statement about (war)'? Or are they trying to explore in play the various aspects of people in war? 3:16's futility, carry's Burdens &amp; the consequences of failing to bear them, Grey Rank's children of a doomed revolt, Shell Shock's psychological grind, etc. I don't think we're ever better off with the former. Well, I'm not. If I want to know your position on (war), I'll ask you. But even if we disagree on (war), a fun game can still be had in the second case.<br/><br/>That said, for some people setting the game in a fictional war removes the emotional link. I can understand that, even if I don't share it to the same degree. Does Grey Ranks work better in Warsaw, Poland, Calumet, Colorado, or Nilosyrtis, Martian Free State?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360656/#Comment_360656" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T21:26:47+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  9:26PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Practically speaking, with some gamers, setting a game in a real historical period sets off a lot of disputes about what the infantry weapon really was for the average soldier of that period, the loadout on T-72 tanks, the stopping power of a panzerfaust used against Jeeps... everything grinds to a halt as people argue about historical facts.
