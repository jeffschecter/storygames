Nixon used (came up with?) the term as an umbrella term to describe all of roleplaying, and then later on it began to be used by some (notably, in the Pacific NW, I think) as a term to describe a specific, nebulous subset of roleplaying.<br/><br/>Any more insight from folks who were hangin' around the block before I was here (that would be pre-2009)? Where did it come from, how did it get to where it is today? What role did this website's name have in it?<br/><br/>I'm curious especially to hear from people like: Andy, Clinton, Jason M, Vincent, Clyde Rhoer, and anyone else who feels they were there to see the evolution of the term.<br/><br/>Thanks, friends!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395139/#Comment_395139" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T12:05:45+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 12:05PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a thread or two around here, but the simple story is this:<br/><br/>On RPGNet, some douchebags were arguing that My Life With Master (in particular, but others as well) was *not* a role-playing game (even though it was a game where you Play Roles) because it included:<br/>* An Endgame Mechanic<br/>* Strong Scene Framing<br/>* Scene-style Resolution<br/>* Character Freedom<br/>and so on.<br/>A few folks took the above four main elements of why it was not an RPG. "I don't know what it is, but it's certainly not a <b>role-playing game</b>".<br/><br/>On a gaming blog Clinton was posting to at the time, he basically rolled his eyes with his whole body, and said "Okay, whatever. They're "Story Games", I guess."<br/><br/>It wasn't really a rallying cry or anything, it was a "toss this bone to shut up these bozos" thing, but the term stuck.<br/><br/>I then thought the term was cool, and registered the domain name about a day later*.<br/><br/>The next 6+ years of mess have built off of that. But that's the real, original, true story.<br/><br/>There's kind of a happy epilogue, though: Some of the folks on RPGNet that were arguing that My Life With Master and other games with Endgame mechanics were not role-playing games, later realized that they were role-playing games after all, <b><i>just not ones that they are interested in playing</i></b>. Which was the obvious truth of the matter all along.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395148/#Comment_395148" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T13:10:31+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  1:10PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Andy!

And no one uses GMless correctly (besides, GMless isn't always what I'm looking for at a given moment.)<br/><br/>To make matters worse, many members of this community are part of the movement in RPGs that I am interested in... but I have to wade through D&amp;D shills, references to new games which have pretty much the same rules philosophy I saw in Marvel Superheroes First Edition and apologists for Old School gaming and that makes me a little bitter about the term "Story Games."  Not bitter at the people who coined it, but at the guys who try to cloud the issue or claim that their stuff doesn't need to change (if they want to apply the term.)</blockquote>\nThat's too bad that this community isn't exactly what you were looking for, Arpie, but yeah, what Andy said: "No one owns the term Story Game."<br/><br/>People use it in all <i>kinds</i> of ways, some that really piss me off until I step back and remember that it <i>doesn't matter in the slightest</i>.

I've <i>never</i> actually seen that used among human beings in real life, though, across many different contexts of play (friends, cons, gaming at stores, etc). I only see that on the internet.<br/><br/>Folks across the PNW (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/playoutloudpdx?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" rel="nofollow">including myself</a>) who use it as a pitch term use it pretty much exclusively as a marketing term that might be better for explaining what we do to non-self-identified gamers.<br/><br/>This is beyond the scope of this thread, but someday I'll have to ask John Harper about his feelings about the term <i>used in that way</i>. Stray comments of his (in my weak remembrance) paint a picture of dislike for that, and as John's a smart guy and active in the PNW community I'm sure he has good insights.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395423/#Comment_395423" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T14:28:07+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  2:28PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate this: "It's a game where, you know, like, <i>the story</i> is more important than any given character.

It implies that some ideas might have more weight because they are inherently "better", leading to vetoing or reducing other people's input. It's a censorship cudgel or a cop-out.<br/><br/>I'd phrase it instead as "making the story you want". And we all might want different stories, which is awesome and why we have all sorts of mechanics to resolve conflicts and decide who has authority over what. And don't get me wrong: I think my ideas are the most awesome all the time! Of course. And other people love their ideas too.<br/><br/>But I absolutely think we need categorical distinctions when different games are built for entirely different styles of play. People have to know what they're getting into and what they're expected to do. I think that's something the whole gaming society/technology/industry is really behind on: clearly communicating what a person is going to be asked to do in a game, sans marketing glitter.<br/><br/>When I pitch story games to folks every week, I emphasize that if they've only played games like D&amp;D (and most new folks have) where they just control their character, these games are going to be different. In these games their contribution is greater than their character. Much greater. And we <i>need</i> everyone to contribute for the game to work.

As such, it's useful to have a group label.  <br/><br/>The closest to a good term to distinguish them is "story games".  Previously, we had used "indie role-playing games" - but that was coincidental, since from the beginning it was accepted that otherwise-traditional RPGs were also indie if they were creator-owned.

I don't like "adventure game" as a generalization for non-story-games, because there can be purely in-character games that don't feature the players trying to beat the adventure that the GM provides.  This is true of many Nordic larps, as well as non-larps that work along similar lines.  If I'm playing out how my character deals with the grief of losing a loved one through various scenes, I'm dependent on my character's fictional ability to do things - but I don't think the activity is properly described as an adventure game.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395836/#Comment_395836" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T02:11:26+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  2:11AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a hopeless exercise to attempt to make 'story games' mean something more narrow than 'roleplaying games'.

She asked, "like D&amp;D?" I said, "sort of, but sci-fi." (we were playing 3:16). She asked if we talked in accents, I said "sometimes" she asked if we wore funny hats, I said, "no". It was a good exchange, and in retrospect the term "story game" would have been hella confusing (not to mention that under Ben's definition 3:16 isn't a "story game"--it's just that my tack in the past has been to use "story game" for everything, and when talking about it with another coworker and using that term, it was confusing).<br/><br/>However, I'm one of the folks who have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/playoutloudpdx?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" rel="nofollow">formed a gaming community</a> in Portland, and one of the terms we use on Facebook for what we do is "story games". I think in the gaming community using this different, nebulous terminology can be helpful if you are doing something different than playing the latest version of D&amp;D or Shadowrun at your meetups (we specifically don't offer those games, as there are already places to scratch your itch for that in Portland). We don't really know what we mean by "story games", but we do know (and those checking us out know) that it's different from what they're used to, or can be. Perhaps it's only a good marketing term to long-time gamers who have not branched out from their "preferred system", as it tells them we're doing something different. I dunno, though. I feel like the jury's still out.<br/><br/>Part of me thinks it's the kind of term that's good when you don't squint too hard at it.

In Sorcerer players create their own Kickers and starting demon. Contenders players frame their own scenes.<br/><br/>The first two might not seem like much but those are huge leaps from just showing up and playing an adventure you have no input into. And after all those are early games experimenting in new territory.\n<blockquote>Hey Ben, your definition is okay, but I have a question: is Monsterhearts a story game according to your criteria?

That can mean a lot of explaining to overcome standard assumptions for those players ("no, there's no GM" or "it' uses Roshambo instead of dice!") which is why short-hand labels are helpful.<br/><br/>If you're at PAX, you're contrasting against video games primarily, with CCGs as a secondary consideration. You have to say "tabletop" in that environment to make it clear what you're talking about, and "RPG" carries a lot of assumptions with that crowd, but otherwise they're pretty open to weird games.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what we're really talking about is "games from this community", because while our games can be wildly different, we play and talk with each other a lot and our games are often pretty well cross-pollinated. There are also plenty of other games out there with weird mechanics, unusual settings, and from independent/self-published creators that we would all automatically recognize as alien to our tradition. <br/><br/>One place I see this come up is in organizing Games on Demand. Depending on the convention, the way we need to describe the event and the games we're running shifts with audience preconceptions. How do we determine who the volunteers are and what games they can run at the event, and how do we describe what this set of games is to potential players? I have answers to these questions, but I'm sure they're not the same as yours.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395873/#Comment_395873" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T07:10:55+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  7:10AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't understand.

I prefer it to "roleplaying games" because it has fewer incorrect assumption-sets tangled up in it.<br/><br/>I think definitions are less helpful than descriptions or comparisons, and so when people ask me what story games are, my responses are usually some remix of these elements:<br/><br/><i>"They're games you play with a group of friends, often around a table over the course of an evening. So, you sit down, together, and the idea is to create characters and improvise in the voice of those characters, and create a story together.

I think you'd be really good at it, because you're naturally [relevant trait], which is a big thing in story games. We play on most Wednesdays, if ever you're free."<br/><br/>"Well, they're like... okay, so most recently I played this one story game called Monsterhearts. It's a game about teenage monsters, like Buffy or Twilight. And everyone creates a character, and then they speak in the voices of those characters, and also describe their actions.

I'm not an Apocalypse World pro so I may be getting AW wrong.\n<blockquote>In a story game, a player\u2019s ability to affect what happens in the game is not dependent on their character\u2019s fictional ability to do those things.</blockquote>\nMeaning it happens because the player wants it to happen, not because the character is fictionally capable of making it happen. To ultra-simplify (and lose a lot of nuance) stance is about different reasons to make choices, but this is about whether the rules give you the ability to make things happen that are not justified by the character's power in the fiction. Do you have to be a good wall-climber to climb the wall or can you succeed because you want it to happen?<br/><br/>It's possible that because moves always start from a character stat [that directly measures their ability to do that thing], they don't fit the definition. On the other hand it's standard procedure in AW to make the setting with the players which would definitely count.<br/><br/>Also: I think there's a danger of trying to squeeze games into a definition because one side is "cooler" than the other or some such rot. That's not what I'm shooting for. I like story games. I like adventure games.

Though on the other hand this is probably also a matter of semantics, such as what do we mean by "rules" exactly, and whether we take "game" to mean an idealized/formalized set of rules or an individual instance of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396023/#Comment_396023" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T05:49:32+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  5:49AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, Ben, I like your explanation and that's pretty much my functional reasoning as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396025/#Comment_396025" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T05:57:41+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  5:57AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu, I think I know what you're talking about but can you give you an example?

formed at 4am.<br/>Although I generally refer to these types of games as "story games" it's mostly just out of habit because it's how I was introduced to them. At the time I was only familiar with 4e D&amp;D and this definition that John is so opposed to was actually a great way to let me know what I was in for and shift gears.<br/>But at the same time I feel it's too broadly applied and is a lot of times used to make roleplaying sound more dignified, sort of like calling all comics "graphic novels".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396341/#Comment_396341" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T08:08:23+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  8:08AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, this is a pretty simple technical question. The way I look at it (which I guess is very similar to Ben's) is that a story game - as distinct from a role-playing game - is where the mechanics of the game allow the player to create beyond a single role. <br/><br/>Of the games I've played, Microscope is the most extreme instance as you're creating far above a single role almost all the time, but there are subtler examples. I think of Fiasco as a story game because the players are establishing scenes (i.e. creating facts) above and beyond their character. For Archipelago and Seid, the players also control elements or themes that allow them to create for the environment or for other player's characters. I could make similar statements for pretty much all GM-less games (indeed, I would find it hard to hard to think of a GM-less game which I _wouldn't_ consider a story game). Theatre improv is a story game because the actors are constantly creating for the scene around them and for each other's characters. <br/><br/>By contrast, I wouldn't call Dread Jenga or Monsterhearts story games. I think of them as a narrative-driven role playing games because, while they're very story-centric, the mechanics don't give the player the ability to create beyond their character. For Monsterhearts the MC can - and should -run it in a very 'story game' manner with a lot of blind offers, sharing scene framing responsibilities with the players, but these are options for the MC to delegate their authority (as could be done in every rpg) rather than for the player. <br/><br/>(I realise as I write this that there's an instance in setup for a couple of skins where you create for ancillary characters like your Dark Power or your gang.) <br/><br/>NB I don't imply by any of this that certain games should or shouldn't be discussed on this site... I'm on UK RPG as well and we don't say <br/><br/>"Woah, dude (or Oi, mate) that game's not British enough to be spoken about here." <br/><br/>This site has wide shoulders that can support all kinds of conversations. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>As to the utility as to drawing a definition between rpg and story game to gamers, I don't think there's a great benefit. I find that the GMed/GM-less tag is a far better indicator of the kind of contribution that I'll be expected to make to a game. What I do use the term "story game" for is for pitching to non-gamers (indeed I'm doing exactly that with Forsooth! with some non-gamers tomorrow night). For one, it brings the object of the game - creating a story together - front and centre, and it avoids a lot of the baggage that 'role-playing game' has developed over the years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17449/the-etymology-of-the-term-story-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17449/the-etymology-of-the-term-story-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17449/the-etymology-of-the-term-story-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17449%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17449%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
