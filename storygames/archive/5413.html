I'm not promoting something of my own. I want you to promote yourself to me. And, yeah, it's not gaming related. But I know there are a lot of talented computer-saavy folks on here who design websites as their day job. We are revamping the website for my law firm. The person we used underwhelmed me--basically just a Wordpress build that I could have done myself. Our existing site can be found <a href="http://www.floridacollections.com" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.<br/><br/>Anyone with experience creating business sites feel free to contact me at my work e-mail jdj[at]floridacollections[dt]com or whisper me with questions or your contact info.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
