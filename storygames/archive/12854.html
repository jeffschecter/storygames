Possibly the most intensely curious feeling I ever had was was when I was maybe 4 and my dad pointed to this castle in some strange shop we were in (it was either a hobby shop or a convenience store, I will never remember, hehe) which was one that you buy and construct yourself out of cardboard pieces.  I remember using my young mind trying to comprehend this labyrinthine castle structure in all its complexity and mystery, and ever since then I've been hooked.  Oh yeah and this one had ghosts.  I must have asked my dad to get me that castle for days and then even months later (I think we never got it because I was too young to be able to build it, and it was probably expensive).<br/><br/>Anyway, I've always been dissatisfied with the exploration of castles in games.  As far as video game go, I've tried to have fun with Medieval Total War or Stronghold, but neither game really focuses enough on all of the cool concepts you could take from the idea of the castle.  Story games and castles?  Actually there is an interactive online story game called Castle Marrach out there which is pretty intriguing.  I haven't had time to invest into it, since it's persistent, but it's got interesting ideas.  But not much else really comes to mind.<br/><br/>I dunno where I'm going with this, I just thought it was an interesting subject :-)  If anyone else likes castles, feel free to add comments.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289433/#Comment_289433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T15:48:41+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  3:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone mentioned something a while back--and I'm not sure which part of what I'm about to say is mine or someone else's idea, but I like it in any case--an idea for an rpg where your character sheet, instead of detailing a character, details a castle, and all the people inside, and all the salient details and whatnot. I don't know what this game would look like. Every player has a castle? Are they warring (or neighboring) kingdoms?

Probably not as much as you, but I like them. I also found that most games were pretty unsatisfying on this front. Even games like Stronghold which were all about building and maintaining a castle had silly stuff in them, like swordsmen collapsing a castle wall or whatever.<br/><br/>You might be interested in the upcoming splatbook for Chronica Feudalis which deals with nobles and has a "Mansion mechanic" or something of the like. Seeing how satisfying CF was in evoking a correct medieval feel with simple mechanics, I have high hopes for it.<br/><br/>Montsegur 1244 is all about people living and dying IN a castle, but has practically no castle stuff itself. I felt it's was worth bringing up.<br/><br/>I'm not really familiar with it, but I think ASoIaF RPG could also do a pretty good game about living in a castle, but again, nothing about the castle itself.<br/><br/>What else is there?

The details it gets into are incredibly fun. Sadly, it doesn't get to the details of the castles themselves. The system also seems to handle politics and intrigue fairly well, so it could be very good for telling the stories of characters in the castle and its surroundings. The characters' adventures can lead to fortune (or misfortune) for their house, too, modifying the stats of the house and therefore its standing in the world.<br/><br/>I feel like there could be an interesting castle game buried in the concepts of How to Host a Dungeon. Rather than exploring the history of a dungeon, you explore the history of a castle: when it was built, and by whom? What significant events occurred during its history? Was it ever conquered, and by whom? Who lives there now? What about the city that has sprung up around it? etc. etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289479/#Comment_289479" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T20:29:11+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  8:29PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite><br/>I feel like there could be an interesting castle game buried in the concepts of How to Host a Dungeon.

If that process looks like it's going to take too long, you could just attack someone else's castle and take it for yourself. Your castle is used to house and support your family, your household staff, your personal servants, and your retinue of men-at-arms and dependent knights. It can be used to host festivals and tournaments. And of course it can be used as a defense in case someone attacks you. Plus, you know, it's a huge play-set for all sorts of adventures.<br/><br/>I really like castles too. So much that I'm very tempted to learn some French, travel to France for a summer, <a href="http://www.guedelon.fr/" rel="nofollow">and volunteer to work on this</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289490/#Comment_289490" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T21:18:35+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  9:18PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One lovely thing about living in England is the castles.

Part of the purpose is to rediscover these techniques. It's taking a long fucking time, like building a caste in the Middle Ages took. Isn't that amazing? Frankly I'm absolutely flabbergasted that such a thing even exists. When I first found out about it (through the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fantasy-Freaks-Gaming-Geeks-Imaginary/dp/1599214806" rel="nofollow">Fantasy Freaks &amp; Gaming Geeks</a>, which is good if you like reading memoirs &amp; things about broader gaming culture) I was literally in awe for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
