Tybolt, the Prince of Ryeic, was burdened by his kingdom's war with Uran and was being pressured by his family into marrying Naja, a princess of Uran, as a way of bringing peace to the two troubled kingdoms. However, Ryeic itself was plagued by internal problems as well. The kingdoms coffers were nearly empty while the nobles lounged and dined on exotic food, strutted in expensive clothing, and reeked of rare perfumes. He also dreamed of following in the footsteps of the Great King Jarrell who founded the kingdom's universities, and leading the kingdom into a golden age of learning and reason.<br/><br/>Tybolt managed to bring agents of the powerful church to heal and had them bless the peace talks with Uran in spite of their belief that Uran was a nation of  savages and heretics, but he could not reign them in from rooting out heresy from the kingdom's universities. He was able to claim the books in the capital of Ryeic's universities for his own personal collection, saving them from being taken by the church, but he could not save the university from becoming a church institution on the order of his father, the King.<br/><br/>He did stay his father's hand from having his guard ride through the streets, killing peasants who rioted for want of food and because of steep taxes, convincing him instead to find ways to reduce the burden on the peasants. However, his father instead let the infrastructure of the kingdom crumble, roads being given over to weeds and walls crumbling while he celebrated in his palace until his death.<br/><br/>In the end, Tybolt did manage to negotiate a peace with Uran, returning to them the mines of Leerin, which Uranians dug and died but were taken by Ryeic in the second war with Uran. In this he found an ally with Naja. She gave him a gift of a wooden carved doe, a symbol of peace in Uran, and two years later they were wed. Tybolt and Naja had many children, but when Tybolt became King he was a reclusive one, retreating to his study and poring over the tomes claimed from the university, and was said to carry a heavy sadness. The palace's halls no longer filled with the sounds of celebrations and festivities.. He died while still quite young of a wasting disease, but is remembered as the king who finally put an end to the bloodshed with Uran.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>We do plan on playing again, and I am already excited to see what Influences the next character takes, and what their relationship is to King Tybolt.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324031/#Comment_324031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T21:07:33+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  9:07PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question about Hero's Banner.<br/><br/>It's hard to tell from your write-up here, what this looked like in play.

We design characters, we create a relationship map. We go from a character to another, making a scene about them. In the past, I used to frame the scene most of the time, but in the future, I intend to encourage players to frame some or all of their scenes.<br/><br/>Free narration is free narration between player and GM, with participation of audience, hopefully. There is no structure, really. I drive towards conflict. Conflict can be over big or small stakes. I tend to prefer big stakes, of course, and have a lot of time pass in between scenes.<br/><br/>You have three influences, each represented by an ideal, a connection or several, and a goal. Only one goal is achieved in the end.<br/><br/>What I like to do is frame a conflict that forces a character to choose whether to favor a goal over another. This is just story stuff, it has no mechanical effect on the endgame. You can advocate a goal all through the game and choose another one in the end.<br/><br/>So you roll percentage under the appropriate inluence. Win or lose, I, the GM, narrates. Unless you choose to push.<br/><br/>Pushing makes you much more likely to succeed, but is no guarantee. It also carries big consequences.<br/><br/>-It polarizes your influences. One becomes stronger and another weaker. Usually by quite a bit.<br/>-Endgame becomes that much closer.<br/><br/>Also, when you push, win or lose, you narrate.<br/><br/>When the conflict is over, we move to another scene with another player. <br/><br/>Personally, I don't just go around the table, I jump more-or-less randomly from a player to another, with their permission (it should be your turn, but I'd like to do Robin's scene first, is that okay?), depending on what ideas I have, and who is furthest from endgame. I do try to get everyone to endgame at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324151/#Comment_324151" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T13:17:06+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  1:17PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, our moment to moment play was mostly free roleplay until I thought there was some cool outcome that we could make the dice determine. Whether Tybolt's tutor was thrown in jail by his father, or the outcome of initial peace negotiations with an Uranian delegation. Really, it was like any other RPG I'vep layed lately, but instead of rolling states or skills or whatever, you're rolling against whichever possible fate the player is personally interested in.<br/><br/>Carly pretty early on started stacking her points into the peace with the Uranian culture. I asked her afterwards if that was her plan, and she'd said she actually figured she would go for the academic golden age in Ryeic, but then once we got playing the war with Uran just seemed the most important. That's another thing I like about the game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the conflicts we were rolling against were small or large. I think they were medium size. Rolls included:<br/><br/>- Talking the King out of slaughtering peasants in the streets.<br/>- Trying to get Uran to agree to a cease of hostilities without giving away Ryeic's mines.<br/>- Convincing a cardinal of the church to bless the peace negotiations and allow Uran's priest to perform his own ceremony.<br/>- Halting imminent violence between a lord of Ryeic and the Uranian princess's honor guard when the guard refused to disarm inside the Ryeic lord's land.<br/><br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324180/#Comment_324180" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T16:01:22+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  4:01PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, that makes sense to me.

I say, "So, I think this is going to need a die roll." A conflict with another character, some danger to somebody who matters, maybe an inner struggle of some sort. It's like most other games, really.<br/><br/>You talk about what's at stake, but I'm not sure the phrase stakes setting is right. There is something the character is trying to succeed at, success or failure is determined by the roll, and how it plays out is determined by who has narration rights. If your buddy is threatened by some evil cultist (as an example) depending on who's narrating the buddy could get stabbed, could get dragged away, could get possessed by the cultist's demon god, whatever.<br/><br/>Personally, I think what's cool about the game is how the setting is defined and created around the influences. I had no idea Ryeic was going bankrupt until Carly wrote an influence about it, but then it was and we had to figure out why and how it was getting worse. Each successive hero builds on that, exploring issues raised by the previous hero but also developing the world further and more deeply.<br/><br/>Also I like narrating my characters dying.You don't often see the whole life of a character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324221/#Comment_324221" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T17:59:53+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  5:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the generational aspect of the game.
