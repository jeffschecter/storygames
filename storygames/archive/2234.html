                    I want to run a street level Unknown Armies game. I've got a couple of very interested people, but not enough, much less a time or place to play. Since UA is supposed to be very player- and player character-driven, I want the players to define the bulk of the setting, probably using the pre-game rules from Universalis. However, I don't want the players to know the aspects of Unknown Armies that one shouldn't give away in a street level game (how magic works, the various occult underground organizations, etc. My plan is to do the Universalis thing, but limit my players to the mundane, and possibly vague hints at the supernatural (trigger event and "what you hear"-type stuff). During actual play, I'll introduce the supernatural into the setting they created. My players will most likely have only played d20 and/or the oWoD, so this will probably be more input than they're used to having.<br/><br/>Is this a good idea, or do you think the conflict between player-driven aspects and GM-driven aspects will be disruptive? Is there too much of a danger of screwing up the players' creation by "revealing" supernatural elements that may contradict my players' visions?<br/><br/>Thanks.                </div>

                            You can do this without the players being especially aware of how much input they're getting.  Have each player, as part of their character creation, give you: (a) a reliable friend, (b) a longstanding rival or enemy, (c) a family member, (d) a place that their character frequents.  Then knit those together to create the "setting."<br/><br/>For extra fun, have them submit those things but without names for the people.  Then make one character's family member another character's rival, and yet another character's friend.  If the people come to you without names, you can pretty freely match them up to be the same person.<br/><br/>Both of these methods offload most of the setting-creation onto the players, but it doesn't <em>seem</em> to them like they're doing anything onerous.                        </div>

                            I'm aware of that sort of device, but I'm looking for more input. The requirements you listed provide little in the way of location, the broader aspects of the setting, or the PCs' reasons for knowing each other and doing a fool thing like investigating or stumbling upon supernatural phenomena together. In my experience, such methods do little in the way of drawing as many details out of the players as I want. Universalis' pre-game provides more than a supporting cast. It generates a much larger and more nuanced context that the players create together. As a player and GM, I'm extremely reactive. I don't just want a few bricks to build with; I want a ready-made foundation that I know the players like, understand, and are invested in because they created it themselves.                        </div>

                            If they tell you why they're interested in investigating the supernatural with each other, they will probably have to tell you a thing or two about their experience with the supernatural, and hence determine a thing or two about how magic works. My advice? Let them. Tynes probably won't send the death squad after you.                        </div>

                            Alright. What if I introduce everything supernatural in actual play? I would like to keep the element of mystery, and explaining UA metaphysics and other setting particulars to newbies is difficult and often makes the game sound silly.                        </div>

                            Yeah, who said anything about explaining it? Just roll with whatever they throw you. Whatever it is that they think their characters understand about the supernatural, you are free to show them through play how they leapt to false conclusions.                        </div>

                            I'm starting an Unknown Armies campaign with pretty similar outlook. This is what I did:<br/><br/>I created an initial situtation with a central NPC all characters are tied in, who's gone missing, and outlined other NPCs connected to him. Then I wrote out short concepts for four player characters (about one paragraph), selected theme songs for the characters, and handed them to players with instructions to write out short backgrounds for their characters. After I receive them, I flesh out the setting based upon relationships and personal histories of the characters. Upon starting playing, we'll first have a short workshop, in which we flesh out the characters relationships with each other and talk about the setting in general (on street-level).<br/><br/>The starting situtation is there to ensure that characters get drawn in to some supernatural stuff, but wheter they dive into it, is up to the players. I have one player who knows more about the UA-setting that others, so I assigned a concept who'd be likely to know that somethings going on below the surface to him. There's very little of supernatural stuff on the character backgrounds, except for the Mystic Event I instructed them to come up. If the players choose to explore the supernatural stuff, I can show them.<br/><br/>I've so far received two character backgrounds which are full of usefull stuff; both relationships that can be exploited and especially personalities that can drive the play forward and provide loads of stuff without even need to touch the setting stuff-out-of-the-book. I've tried to design a campaign which'll be as character-driven as possible.                        </div>

                            I have several perspectives on this.<br/>
<br/>
First, the UA metaphysics are, in fact, somewhat silly. Oh, not because of the specifics, but because they're laid out as fact. The disconnect with player and character doesn't come even so much from knowing what the metaphysics are, but from knowing as a player with absolute certainty that they're true for the character.<br/>
<br/>
The character can't possibly know this, and will always feel doubt. I think that, in many ways, it's more effective to present a universe in which these truths are not known to the player, but where the metaphysics are as fuzzy as they are in real life. Let the players, along with their characters, speculate on the meaning of the events their characters encounter.<br/>
<br/>
That said, from another perspective, why not share this all with the players, and let them deal with it as the wish? That is, if you keep it a secret, and then slowly reveal it, the problem is that the players still get the feeling that they're being exposed as players to the "truth." Something like, "Well, the GM is throwing this stuff out there, there's nothing else to react to, so I really have no choice but to assume that he's revealing a truth. The same problem occurs, more or less.<br/>
<br/>
If it's out in the open, then the players know that you don't have a pre-set metaphysics, per se, and that they can react to it in any manner they choose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of "location" stuff... like what? You're playing in a world that, other than the presence of this supernatural stuff, is just like ours, no? So what do you need to know? The stuff suggested above will give you all you need to make action in play. The locational stuff... besides dressing scenes, what's it good for?<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that you can come up with such informaton as needed in play. So can the players, by the way. "I go to the nearest McDonalds and wait to meet my contact." Why bother to do that before hand?<br/>
<br/>
In Universalis, you do this on a scene-to scene basis as part of play.<br/>
