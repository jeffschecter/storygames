A 48-hour game design jam, all over the world. Near you probably.<br/><br/>Vidjagorms, you say!!! I don't program!<br/><br/>Well, it doesn't have to be videogames. You can make tabletop games, too.<br/><br/>But!<br/><br/>If you are a tabletop designer or tinkerer, you have plenty of skills to bring to the table. My team consists of me, a programmer, and an art/sound guy. They both have good ideas, but I've found (maybe because I'm firmly grounded in the tabletop space?) that the way I think about and communicate and organize game mechanics and procedures has been a big help to my group (the poor programmer has to do the heavy lifting, though: I'm all "Here's the game, now make it work!").<br/><br/>There's a "prompt", like a Game Chef theme (last year it was a picture, this year it was a sound file), and then a bunch of extra constraints you can put on your design or not. One of the big constraints this year is "Games for Change." <a href="http://janemcgonigal.com/" rel="nofollow">Jane McGonigal</a> is even hanging out at the Portland venue!<br/><br/>So, next year, do it. You can show up solo (like I did) or roll in there with your tabletop team and fuck the place up. Put it on your calendars. In Portland, at least, it's free and free food is provided all weekend.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LoieJ6av704/UQN_dyNPRZI/AAAAAAAABos/f5K3w_3vnyI/s902/1359166700848.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-869aVkUeox0/UQN_3fKZi4I/AAAAAAAABqk/MaIu1BefQsA/s902/IMAG0327.jpg"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405192/#Comment_405192" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T08:48:32+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  8:48AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that there is pizza in the picture.

That's cool--that's what I did this year.

He went to the game jam as it was happening in Australia (because he wants to help facilitate these in Japan in the future), and mentioned that there were indeed people creating analogue games. Mostly board games, but still. Of course, not a LOT of people, but enough to actually notice it and mention. So it sounds like the precedent is already set.<br/><br/>Next year is just a matter of finding a group or facilitating your own...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405413/#Comment_405413" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T17:27:04+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  5:27PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a group in Portland make a card game.
