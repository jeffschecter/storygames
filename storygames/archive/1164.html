                    Hey Story Games!<br/><br/>I'm Vikingizing Agon and I could use a hand.  The Gods are supposed to have symbols, but I'm having a tough time nailing the quintessential features and associations of the Norse pantheon.  Poseidon's got his trident, but what does Baldr have?  Also, are the abilities right on?  Here's what I've got so far:<br/><br/>Ã“Ã°inn <br/>Symbols:  ravens<br/>Abilities:  might, insight, sword<br/><br/>Frigg <br/>Symbols:  spinning wheel<br/>Abilities:  cunning, spirit, aim<br/><br/>Ã†gir <br/>Symbols:  cauldron, beer<br/>Abilities:  hunt, spirit, spear<br/><br/>Freyr<br/>Symbols:  sword, boat<br/>Abilities:  heal, insight, sword<br/><br/>Ullr<br/>Symbols:  bow, shield<br/>Abilities:  shield, hunt, aim<br/><br/>Forseti<br/>Symbols:  silver<br/>Abilities:  insight, lore, orate<br/><br/>Loki<br/>Symbols:  mistletoe<br/>Abilities:  lore, might, cunning<br/><br/>Heimdallr<br/>Symbols:  horn<br/>Abilities:  athletics, grace, sword<br/><br/>ÃžÃ³rr<br/>Symbols:  hammer<br/>Abilities:  athletics, spirit, shield<br/><br/>Freyja<br/>Symbols:  necklace, boar<br/>Abilities:  cunning, grace, aim<br/><br/>TÃ½r<br/>Symbols:  chain<br/>Abilities:  might, wrestle, spear<br/><br/>Baldr<br/>Symbols:  ship, mayweed<br/>Abilities:  music, heal, aim<br/><br/>Any scholars or people who actually worship these dudes want to hook me up?

                            Ã“Ã°inn's horse, Sleipnir, had eight legs -- it was the offpsring of a giant and Loki. It appears on stone carvings from the Viking period, so it was a recognizable symbol of the god. His most notable other symbols apart from his ravens, Huginn and Muninn, are probably his spear, Gungnir, and being one-eyed. I don't know what the Agon abilities are like, so I can't comment there. He is also associated with the practice of seiÃ°r -- sorcery, necromancy, divination, that kind of thing. He constantly appears in different forms, though; at least one of his many names means "mask."<br>
<br>
Ã¾Ã³rr seams like an obvious candidate for Might as a skill; he was notably strong, with a magic belt which further enhanced his strength. <br>
<br>
Forseti is not attested from many sources, but I would have thought he was associated with gold rather than silver. <br/>
<br/>
Tyr's symbol might also be a hand, which relates to the same story as the chain -- that he sacrificed his hand during the binding of the wolf. <br/>
<br/>
Freyr is also associated with boars -- he has a boar named Gullinbursti ("gold-bristles"). <br/>
<br/>
Freyja is also associated with cats -- her chariot was drawn by cats and accounts of catskin in some ritual clothes maaaaaaaaay have something to do with that, assuming they represent reality at all. <br/>
<br/>
Do you need a set number, or could Njord and Skadi both be included?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            The Loki-fire thing is probably just based on the similarity of <i>Loki</i> and <i>logi</i> ("flame.") It's clear in the Prose Edda that they're two different individuals -- Loki loses to Logi in an eating competition hosted by yet another character called Loki* -- but the connection is strong in the modern day. The Loge of Wagner's Ring cycle, for instance, is a fire god.<br/><br/>*It's probably unfair to call Logi an individual -- he's just flame. "Nothing is hungrier than flame," basically. Similarly, Thor's sidekick Thialfi loses in a race with a guy called Huginn ("thought"), because "nothing is faster than thought," and Thor himself loses a wrestling match with someone called Elli ("old age") because, you know, "even the strongest succumbs to old age." It's a very kid's-story kind of story.                        </div>

                            (crumbs, just lost a long post)<br/><br/>Thanks, I've adjusted accordingly.<br/><br/>The list is fixed, so if Njord or SkaÃ°i should be included, tell me who to cut.  I thought about it.  I included Forseti to add some purely non-martial balance.  He sits out Ragnarok; he's mellow.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to handle symbols - most are very general ("owl" for Athena) but a couple are specific ("winged boots").                        </div>

                            The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valknut" rel="nofollow">Valknut</a> is probably the best symbol for Odin.<br/><br/>Odin is known as Allfather, God of the Hanged and Betrayer of Men. The latter is because those whom he loves best are allowed to die (a broken weapon or armor, or some other mishap) so that he can bring them to him.<br/><br/>Odin's horse, Sleipnir, has eight legs because it represents four pall-bearers carrying the dead.<br/><br/>It's hard to narrow him down to favored abilities. Insight, Lore, Orate, Cunning and Spear are all suitable.<br/><br/>Freyr is a god of sun, rain and bountiful harvests. His symbols would be the boar (for the boar Gullinbursti, made for him by the dwarves out of gold, representative of the sun), and the ship (representing Skidbladnir, which could be folded up and put in his pocket). Freyr could also be represented by a phallus. In Sweden, where his cult was strongest, statues of Freyr have been found showing him with an erect phallus.<br/><br/>The sword is probably not the right symbol for Freyr. The most extensive surviving myth involving Freyr involves him wooing and marrying a giantess. But one of the things he has to do while courting her is to give away his magical sword. Because of this, he will fight weaponless at Ragnarok and be slain by Surtr. Sword fits as one o his favored abilities though!<br/><br/>I'll try to comment on some of the others later if this is helpful to you.                        </div>

                            Forseti does provide a good non-martial guy, so there's that. SkaÃ°i is martial and female, which is cool if that matters, and it does seem a shame to do a Viking list and not have a sea-god. If I had to cut two figures, I'd cut Ã†gir and Ullr, who are both very minor gods -- at least, the Aegir you're describing is. The beer-brewing Aegir of Lokasenna is probably not the same as the sea-god Aegir who's married to Ran. Not sure about that. SkaÃ°i can take over some of Ullr's hunting and outdoorsy stuff. Her symbol would be skis -- she is called "ski-lady." But the list is really fine the way it is; it could work either way. <br/>
<br/>
Let's see, some other symbols. I agree that symbols are harder for the Norse deities. Let me go down the list and look at items associated with them:   <br/>
<br/>
Frigg: really tough one. She is seldom a major character, which is funny, given her nominal position. She sees the future, but no clear symbol there. If she's really a seer, then I would expected her to have a staff; staves and staff pendants are associated with certain burials, often female, in the Viking period, which may belong to sorcerers. On the other hand, Odin is associated with staves as well. Tough one. <br/>
<br/>
Ã†gir: likewise. He brews beer, so the cauldron might be a good symbol. Of course, in his one appearance in the corpus, he is notably because he *doesn't* have a cauldron, or at least not one big enough to produce the needed beer.<br/>
<br/>
Freyr: sword is an odd choice. Freyr did have a magic sword, but he gave it away. I would say that the phallus is Freyr's most notable symbol, although there's some grounds to doubt this. Ithyphallic images are frequently identified as Freyr. Adam of Bremen talks about an ithyphallic idol to "Fricco." Carts might also be good here -- I think Saxo talks about Freyr riding around the countryside in a cart. <br/>
<br/>
Ullr: shield, yup. One of the kennings for "shield" is "ship of Ullr." He's also a great archer, so bow. Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Forseti: I believe Forseti also had a magic axe -- although that might be in Frisia, where he's more important -- so if you're stuck for a symbol you might say "axe." No one else seems to have it as a symbol. <br/>
<br/>
Loki: he also invented the fishing net, so you might have "net" as a symbol. This also kind of fits in with the trickster image, catching people in traps, being complex, that sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>
Heimdallr: the Gjallarhorn, of course. I also seem to recall an association with rams -- one of the kennings for a head is "Heimdall's sword," which someone (but probably Hilda Ellis-Davison, in which case caution) interpreted to mean that he had horns like a ram. There may have been other sources comparing him to a ram. Unfortunately, the primary source for him no longer exists in its complete form. Drat. He's associated with the colour white -- he's called "the white god" -- and he has gold teeth. <br/>
<br/>
Freyja: certainly, necklaces on female figures are often used as a means for associating them with Freyja. She may also be associated with gold -- she wept tears of gold, and her daughter's name was "Treasure." She had a cloak of feathers which allowed her to fly, so maybe feathers? <br/>
<br/>
Tyr: hmmmm. Is overlap to be avoided? If so, he should keep sword and other people should lose it.<br/>
<br/>
Baldr: I take it mayweed is the plant called "Baldr's eyelash?" "Ring" might also work for Baldr -- Odin placed the magical ring Draupnir on baldr's funeral pyre.                        </div>
