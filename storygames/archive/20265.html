I'm looking for inspiration on how to treat traps in my fantasy game without the encumbrances they bring, like over-cautious PCs, too many die rolls/mechanics, and players wanting realistic explanations to disarm using real-world physics/chemistry/knowledge.<br/><br/>4E has its passive perception mechanic.<br/>Dread's mechanic might be usable.<br/>Rock, paper, scissors?<br/><br/>I was thinking about a system where there's only a chance of a trap if you look for one. I know, that sounds stupid. No one would look for traps, right? But I was noodling about tying a chance of reward to searches. This would let players set their own pace.<br/><br/>I was also thinking about using a deck of standard playing cards. When searching for traps you turn over a card. High traps skill lets you turn over one or two extra cards. Red suit means failed search and trap triggers. Black suit means trap discovered and defeated. Something along those lines to make things fast and easy.<br/><br/>Any ideas or alternate mechanics references for making traps fun?<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446470/#Comment_446470" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T16:51:00+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  4:51PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "There's a pit trap here and you'll fall into it taking 3d6 damage.

How do you avoid it?" and Roger the Rogue's player digs through his sheet to produce a useful skill/background or item or spell, then the GM either says it works or asks the player to make a DC 20 skill check.

That means that we have a sense of why it's there, who set it, and who it's intended for. (Sometimes we might not find out until afterwards, but there you have it.)<br/><br/>This means that a trap's existence should be heavily telegraphed: ideally, the players know that they're dealing with an enemy who is a) smart, b) likes to prepare traps, and c) has the resources to do so. (Most people don't build a pit trap in their house, for instance.)<br/><br/>For instance, there is a manor in the wilderness, where the PCs used to go for nice dinners with the Duke's nieces. Now it's been overrun by a tribe of goblins, who are known for being cunning and inventive and good with their hands. The PCs decide to liberate this manor, and kick the goblins off the property. When they go there, I tell them that the manor doesn't look like it used to look: it seems the goblins have torn up boards here or there, piled up rocks here or there, and made other modifications to the place.<br/><br/>Now we can have a bit of an exciting "looking for traps" bit, all while the players are trying not to be ambushed even as they crawl around looking for trip wires.<br/><br/>An ancient trap (like we see in the typical dungeon) should have some legacy of its presence: perhaps a foul stench from the last deer who wandered in by accident and was caught there, maybe a pile of skeletons in the room with the poison gas, arms outstretched as though they were trying to crawl out before the succumbed to the poison.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the interesting part of a trap, to me, is not "will the PCs notice it before it is sprung", but questions like:<br/><br/>* "This area is likely trapped by your enemies. Do you still want to go through, or will you take the long, long way around, instead, which will give them enough time to escape?"<br/><br/>* "Something's wrong here. It looks like the goblins have been through your own camp and you know they often like to leave a few surprises for the unwary. Can you find them?"<br/><br/>* "There's clearly a trap in this room: dead bodies litter the ground. Probably some kind of fire trap, since they're all scorched. What do you do?"<br/><br/>* "You can see that anyone passing through this corridor sets off a rolling boulder, which crushes anyone in its path. What are you going to do to get through?"<br/><br/>In other words, less "do I notice the trap", and more "looks like there's a trap, can you figure out how it works... and can you get past it?"<br/><br/>I hope this isn't a total derail from the thread topic.<br/><br/>If mechanical advice is wanted, I like something like an Apocalypse World approach: roll some dice, with the following results...<br/><br/>* Really bad roll: you're caught in the trap (rare)<br/>* Really good roll: you avoid the trap, and the situation is safe, or you know exactly how the trap works. (Also relatively rare)<br/>* Average roll: You know there's a trap, and a little bit about it - either its location or how it works - but not enough information to travel through the area safely. What do you do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446494/#Comment_446494" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T18:32:38+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  6:32PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my game there are two ways to avoid a trap:<br/>1.

I'd have to look up the section to be sure, but I believe it talks about DCs and whatnot, but leaves the implementation to the GM. It's perfectly within the 13th Age rules to let the PC stumble around a dungeon map, interact with the trap, puzzle-out how to disarm it, and then do so with nary a single die roll.<br/><br/>It's also perfectly within the 13th Age rules to just throw a trap at the players in a "dungeon montage" and ask them how they avoid it. That's the way a lot of Organized Play adventures go, because they see map-crawling and trap-interactions to be uninteresting parts of play. I'm not sure I entirely disagree, but running adventures that way felt flat to me, so I'm not sure I entirely agree either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446669/#Comment_446669" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T19:39:46+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  7:39PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I'll give 13th Age a pass as long as those dungeon montage rules are nixable.

It works wonders to improvise great and interesting traps. The thing is that every trap has a trigger: crossing a ray of light, stepping on a part of the floor, making noise, walking too fast, walking too slow, too much weight on a certain place, no weight on that place, lighting a place, bringing  a heat source into the place, a switch, a lever, etc etc. The GM then asks players for a precise description of how are they approaching the place, to see if they automatically trigger the trap or have a chance to detect it. Marching order matters too, of course. <br/><br/>If the players actions (or inaction) trigger the trap, it's time for the saving throws. If not, I describe how the trigger looks, but not what it does and it's up to them to describe how will they deal with it. Then can try disabling it, find what it activates, avoid it completely, run trough as fast ast they can, etc. Sometimes it won't require a roll at all, just paying attention and applying some logic. But since there are times when players just don't know what else to do or care more about what's beyond the trap, I let them roll for any skill that may solve the obstacle and keep going.<br/><br/>The effect of the trap is also important. Not all traps have to be lethal; they can be a preparation for something letal. Like a cloud of corrosive gas that will dissolve an armor, but do barely no damage to the PC, unless they choose to not undone it quickly. Another can be meant to make the PCs run deeper into the dungeon, or to activate a trap they may have bypassed before. Even if the players can't avoid the trigger, the effect might be mitigated or completely avoided by taking some previsions.<br/><br/>One of the first traps that I made with the deck was a door with a magical trap that sprouted a line of fire if it was illuminated. When the players slowly approached to the door with a lighted torch, I narrated how the door started to spew a few flames, they went back immediately with barely any harm and tried running (they got burned and those who made the save had to retreat) and later tried going closer without light, which worked. The door however, had a secondary trap that triggered when they opened it: a rune of light would fall from the top of the door, flash and reactivate the fire trap on it. Another group of players avoided both traps by casting "dispel magic" on it. So as you can see, the obstacle can be solved in more than one way, and showing it to the players in bits (the effect, the trigger or a clue to any of them) makes it an interesting riddle to solve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446672/#Comment_446672" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T20:17:43+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  8:17PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like that trap deck gave you some very good results, WarriorMonk!

But meanwhile, making it (or a random table for both triggers and effects) is easy. I took inspiration from two tower-defense like games, "All Orcs Must Die" and "Epic Quest for Mighty Loot" which both feature mechanics for letting the player build different kind of traps. I listed both triggers and effects from those games and all the Indiana Jones movies, as well as some traps I found while playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online. Once you have both lists done, just roll some dice and connect the dots; you can even assign damage of the traps later on the fly, when it's needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
