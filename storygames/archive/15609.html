Priced at $39.99 each, these are awesome keepsakes to collect or enjoy at the table. Each collects four issues: <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231-4&amp;Mode=like">#1-4</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235-8&amp;Mode=like">#5-8</a>, and #9-12; if you buy all three and pick up issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2313&amp;Mode=like">#13</a> in print you'll have the whole run!
