                    I didn't want to clutter the RE2 sticky with design musings. If there is a better place to post this it can be merged or moved.<br/><br/>Stephan Koch's sheet has seven parts: knowledge (with a depth/width component), assets, influence (aranged as a pyramid), the 4 elements, 4 compass points, 4 seasons, and a bulls-eye/labyrinth thingy with 3 blank labels. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/stephenkotch.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/stephenkotch.pdf</a><br/><br/>I like it a lot...<br/><br/>â€œAmong the thirty six thousand things in the universe, longevity is the best.â€ from the Thai Phing Ching<br/><br/>â€œThus during the Yuan-Ting and Yuan-Feng reign-periods there were thousands of magician-technicians in the regions of Yen and Chhi who glared around and slapped their thighs, swearing that they were the real experts in the arts of achieving the lives of the holy immortals..â€<br/>- Ku Yu to the Emperor Chheng Ti<br/><br/>Game concept: the aging emperor has dispatched naturalists, scholars, holy men, and alchemists to find the secrets of the ancient immortals and defeat death. Players are a group of these magician-technicians, perhaps charlatans, perhaps learned and wise, perhaps both, seeking the secrets of material immortality. Racing against the progression of the emperor's ailment, characters travel to legendary lands to gather new knowledge and ingredients. <br/><br/>Using the sheet:<br/><br/>1. Knowledge component: characters' proficiency in the techniques of the ancient immortals, such as:<br/>Respiratory- breathing exercises, with the aim of mimicking embryonic respiration<br/>Heliotherapeutic â€“ sunbathing for men, moon bathing for women<br/>Gymnastic â€“ therapeutic movement, stretching, martial arts,<br/>Sexual- stimulate life force and retain semen<br/>Alchemical and pharmaceutical<br/>Dietary<br/>Knowledge of the lives of the hsien (immortals)<br/><br/>2. assets: alchemical ingredients and elixers, tomes etc.<br/><br/>3. influence: either useful personal contacts or access to emperor<br/><br/>4. four elements: something to do with portents and character's favored techniques (so have to assign elements to techniques). (Since the chinese had 5 elements I'll make the game pseudo-chinese or have a generic empire <br/><br/>5. four compass points: destinations for research and voyages<br/><br/>6. four seasons: phases of game, perhaps each compass point is different during each season so players have to time when they arrive in each location<br/><br/>7. labyrinth: progress of emperor's illnesses. maybe the three labels spaces are the emperor's 3 ailments and they move around the first ring, get worse in the 2nd ring, and kill the emperor if they reach the center                </div>

                            Good idea, Mark.<br/><br/>Mine's from Ashok Desai.  It's all <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/AshokDesai.pdf" rel="nofollow">squishy with biology</a>, which I'm going to take as coded metaphor.  Who would have cells and use a biology metaphor?  War-time academics.  Who would use Ashok's old-timey font?  People in the ninteenth century.  Viola!  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Strings" rel="nofollow">Red String</a> peace activists at Richmond College, 1862.  <br/><br/>FREE ENTRY FIELDS<br/>Name:  The name of your character, I think.  Maybe your code name?<br/>Flavor:  Your character's demeanor - sweet, salty, sour, or bitter.<br/><br/>Membrane:  Your character's protective social layer.<br/>Vacuole:  People who can and will aid your character, subsidiary to the membrane.<br/><br/>TRAITS RANKED ONE TO SIX<br/>The four traits are rated between one and six.  These are weird but workable.  Higher is more resistant and generally better.  <br/><br/>Pliability refers to a character's susceptibility to pressure and overt intimidation.  <br/>Viscosity refers to a character's susceptibility to charm and persuasion.<br/>Cunning refers to a character's susceptibility to trickery and deception.<br/>Sense refers to a character's susceptibility to debate and reason.  <br/><br/>FREE TEXT WITH RATINGS<br/>Tendrils:  Potential cell recruits.

                            My sheet is from <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/jeff%20moore.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jeff Moore</a>.<br/><br/>At first, the broken and solid lines are reminiscent of the I Ching, but a little bit of research shows only a loose connection to the accepted meaning of the various I Ching trigrams, so I'm not sure how much I can use them (if at all).<br/><br/>The attributes given are cascading - I imagine only the full trigram ones on the right are generally used.  Strength, Endurance, Grace and Accuracy on the Body side, versus Reason, Willpower, Perception and Charm on the Mind side.  Interestingly enough, with the equations given on the sheet (which I must use), three pairs of equations will be equal:  Endurance and Grace; Willpower and Perception; Accuracy and Charm.  This makes me think those equations are just a starting point, and after the game begins, the values can change separately.<br/><br/>Considering the space on the sheet devoted to the attributes vs. the space devoted to skills and abilities, obviously this is a nature over nurture kind of game.  The attributes become even more obviously the focus when you look at the Key Aspect chart (where I'm now obligated to use the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1151&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">Taint Of The Wolf</a>, the ten-sided die). Musing on that Key Aspect chart some more, I'm not sure what a 'turn' is in the game yet, but obviously it has them.  Nor am I sure exactly what it means to have a Key Aspect on your turn (or not).  Maybe you get a bonus of some sort if you manage to use the Key Aspect?  Maybe it's a mandate?<br/><br/>The use of a ten-sided die, plus the compounding nature of the attributes (where a Body of 1 implies a Strength of 4, 2 gives 8, and so on), suggest to me a percentile-type system.  Interestingly, characters also have a "level" value.  The "easy way" of course is to treat it like levels in D&amp;D or D&amp;F, especially since the Level sits right next to an Experience area.  <br/><br/>I'll have to keep musing.                        </div>

                            So I got Jason Sims' <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/jason%20sims.pdf" rel="nofollow">violent gem.</a>  Already I'm fascinated.<br/><br/>Maybe I've just been playing too many of Mark's tyrant games, but I'm seeing the gun violence as a metaphor for an unfriendly examination of another person.  The FBI pursuing a criminal, the mob hunting a stoolie, a stalker after a pretty co-ed.  As play progresses, they get closer and closer to the bullseye: finding out about the character.<br/><br/>My ideal for this design: you have a character in mind, but you write down nothing about him.  Your character sheet describes the challenges other players face as they try to get to know him.  My vision of endgame includes the phrase "I know everything about you..."<br/><br/>So, I'm toying with some mechanics to tie that idea to this character sheet.  Some thoughts:
<ul>
<li>I really like the idea of little yellow numbered evidence flags, a la CSI, etc.  that would get scattered over character sheets.<br/></li><li>I'm drawn to the idea that at some <cite>Colossal Arena</cite> style moment, the dice would get rolled and someone would get a "hit."<br/></li><li>I'm trying to decide where on the continuum between one sheet per player and one sheet per table this game falls.<br/></li><li>Everything I consider runs up against the problem of who the Angel is.  It's possible that the Bullseye, the Shooter and the Angel are all roles a player takes on.  But in those roles, do you use the stats on your sheet, or someone else's?<br/></li><li>Maybe the Angel is ambiguous in play.  Could be a guardian angel, an angel of mercy, or and angel of death or righteous anger.<br/></li></ul>
And I guess I recognize that I'm being a little perverse.  I think I read the idea of a character who's self and world are taken apart over the course of the game.  It'd be easy to say "all your rings get hit points, and every resolution you take a blow determined by the shooter's aim , and your avoid and ammo."  But!  There's no place on the sheet to talk about your possessions, or your friends, or your self.  And where's  the fun in getting your anonymous "loved ones" destroyed?  <br/><br/>Which is really where the unfriendly examination comes in.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Mendel%20Schmiedekamp.pdf" rel="nofollow"> Mendel Schmiedekamp's Sheet</a> for me to work with.<br/><br/>The sheet suggests to me:<br/>1) A clock. 12 section. 12 scenes? Let's try that.<br/>2) 4 places for character entry, each with "Form" being a major attribute. 2 upside down, 2 right side up. 2 light, 2 dark.<br/>3) You play 4 different entities throughout the game. You start with 2, and then at some point, the sheet is inverted and you play the other 2.<br/><br/>SO:<br/>Dark old gothic house. Ancient grandfather clock. The people here tonight have secrets of evil deeds past. And the clock judges them.<br/>We get 12 scenes as it ticks toward midnight, then midnight strikes and it's time for Judgement.<br/><br/>In early scenes, we will have low-level supernatural strangeness, and will establish what the past deeds of the characters are. Then, the clock will give them a chance for redemption. As the scenes progress, we get more and more surreal, deeper and deeper into the nightmare world of their past deeds. Everything transforms, they will be confronted with the evil they wrought, and will be tested to see what fate they deserve.<br/><br/>THE SHEET<br/>Right-side up light is your main character, the human person who has commited evil in the past, and is striving for redemption.<br/>Right-side up dark is the minor shadow of SOME OTHER PLAYER'S main character. You will torment him with this shadow.<br/>Upside-down light is your nightmare world character. Transformed into a icon of your evil, and stripped of your humanity.<br/>Upside-down dark is the terror monster of SOME OTHER PLAYER'S main character. You will terrorize him with this creature.<br/><br/>The players use their POWER throughout to control the facts of the world and the outcomes, but at the expense of their HUMANITY, which is ultimately their only defense against the horrors of the shadow world.<br/><br/>That's as much as I got right now.                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>Compelling and unique way to go with it. I'll offer a possible ingredient direction: In the board game Kremlin, there are a set array of "NPC" apparatchiks who can do things according to what office they hold, and can get promoted, demoted, and purged. The players have secretly allocated influence over many of these apparatchiks, and will reveal some of their influence in order to make them do things. Whoever has the most revealed influence over some guy when it is his turn to act gets to say what he does. The fact that someone else may be lying in wait with even MORE influence than you have, waiting for the right time to take him over, is an interesting feature of the game. A similar feature might have a place in yours.<br/><br/>If the sheet is folded exactly in half lengthwise, Tendrils, Membrane, Vacuoles, and Plasm are all perfectly hidden on the face-down side.                        </div>

                            I drew <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/tristan%20brightman.PDF" rel="nofollow">Tristan Brightman's sheet</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say I'm dissapointed and I really don't have much to go on. It is apparent that the sheet falls into the "Making it as hard as possible for the designer" category and, although I could have had worse, I really didn't want to get one from that batch.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm coming up blanks till a 2am creative avalanche hits: (of course all of this is likely to change).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Nowhere's Edge</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>There is a small realm where the soon to be dead wait to cross over. A space on the outskirts of reality where the subconcious bleeds out and shapes reality itself. Those at the border of Oblivion are given a chance to reflect on their lives. The lucky ones, those who find a deeper purpose in their existence, are given a chance to find a way back to the living and complete their mission.</i><br/>
<br/>
The characters are all hanging out in the Antechamber of the Great Beyond, they have all been involved in an accident of some sort and are chilling together. Each character periodically gets sucked into warped versions of significant events from of his/her past and pulls the other characters along for the ride. The point is for a character to discover his/her reason to live (purpose, drive, what have you) and to then use that as a handhold to claw back to the land of the living.<br/>
<br/>
The various keywords are used during the flashbacks. I'm not sure how yet as they are totally obtuse.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes to the left side are your "health" use them all and you're on the short bus to oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
The 3d boxes are used to store "fetters" (to steal from Wraith: The Oblivion) or things that tie you to the world of the living. You fill these through the flashbacks.<br/>
<br/>
"S", "M" and "H": No freak'n clue.<br/>
<br/>
The cut off bits at the bottom: the box is to store your purpose. You actually write another person's purpose and hand it to them, then you need to orchestrate their stories so that they can discover it.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes are used for attempts to revive oneself. This is the only mechanic I've put any thought into. The player writes a number from 1-(max size of whatever dice is being used) in the box and keeps it face down. Then when the player has a shot at waking up they can pick a box (still face down) and try and roll under or equal to the number they have written. However if someone else guesses the number they have written then it's all over. There is some sort of trust/bonus to showing people one of your numbers, thereby allowing them greater odds at screwing you, if they want.<br/>
<br/>
Well that's the germ of an idea. I need to go to sleep now.<br/>
<br/>
And Troy, I hope you are having a less frustrating time with my sheet!                        </div>

                            The luck of the draw put <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Dirk%20Remmecke(sheetonly).pdf" rel="nofollow">Dirk Remmecke's sheet</a> in my hands.<br><br>Last night I printed it out and just looked at it. At first glance it was very neutral, and nothing stirred. The only thing that really stood out in my were:<br><br><i>~There are 9 of those box dealies with the four blank spaces under them.<br>~The aforementioned boxes and the small box to the right of "Role" have no label. These seems to call for player or group determined layers for attributes, abilities, skills, powers or whatever.<br>~The font doesn't really suggest a single setting or mood,  but it's doesn't seem to be geared for a contemporary or high tech setting or mood.<br>~It's very gray.</br></br></br></i><br><br>Upon further reflection this morning, these other points caught my attention.<br><br><i>~The only labeled slots are "Name", "Role" and "Wounds."<br>~The "Name" slot is really long...like longer than it probably needs to be to accomodate the average player or character name. Gotta figure out what goes in the rest of that space.<br>~There's that "Wounds" slot that seems made for tracking hit points or the like. That means combat, maybe? Could they be wounds YOU inflict rather than wounds you receive? Couldn't they just be metaphorical wounds?<br>~That unlabeled box to the right of "Role" should probably be labeled with a symbol or a number.<br>~I don't think "Role" should refer to the character name, but how the character fits into the setting.</br></br></br></br></i><br><br>A start, but nothing meaty enough get a good bite out of.<br><br>Then, this afternoon, I was listening to a podcast and looking at a logo. Those two things bumped into a concept that's been crawling around in the back of my skull and something started to happen. The Selsen-Blue side started to tingle.<br><br>I won't say much more until I've messed about with it a bit, but I think I may have found a handhold. The working title is "The Dragon's Sons." A Googling of said phrase turned up some stuff that seemed to jibe with the concept that' was forming.<br><br>Now the concept, sheet and the beginings of conventions and mechanics are starting to do their dance.

That's already constraining the creative process to a large degree, so we'll see if that works out in a good way.  The sheet has already made me read up on the Tangut, so I've learned a few new things, which is cool.<br/><br/>I haven't decided yet whether I want to know what the symbols mean or just make shit up.<br/><br/>Anyway.  We have sky and earth diagrams with dots; those are either philosophical or spiritual resources.  I think you might use them by connecting them, and it means something different when you connect two through the broken areas.  Then there's a glyph involved, which is leaning more into the spiritual realm.  I figure the character is a spiritual person, maybe a priest or a sorcerer of sort.  The "Fearful Symmetries" sound intriguing... are they things the character fears, or can use to strike fear into other characters' hearts?<br/><br/>The other thing I like is that the Tangut basically fell before Ghengis Khan.  That should offer some setting inspiration.<br/><br/>So, yeah.  I got very little at this point <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I got the sheet made by Meguey Baker: http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Megueybaker.pdf<br/>
<br/>
Name of the game: FateClock<br/>
Theme: the history of our world from ancient times towards the future, exploring humanity<br/>
Mechanics: a deck of cards, high card beats opposition, winner tells the tale (but is liable to get an evil fate)<br/>
Method: free interactive storytelling<br/>
<br/>
EXAMPLE from the game text (so far):<br/>
<br/>
THE RIDER EXPLAINED<br/>
Each player in the game will control a rider. That is; in the FateClock game you are an unsubstantial and eternal being, one of the sources of souls in our world. To create the world, and to recreate it, that is your sole purpose. The rider exist through the personalities and peoples it manipulate, in eternal competition and cooperation with the other riders. You spawn souls, and then you possess them. That is what you are; a creator and claimer of souls.<br/>
<br/>
So, what is the purpose of claiming souls? To play with them. To experience their feelings. To sense the world. To understand, explore, dominate. There are as many reasons for claiming a soul as there are different riders, and different souls. The rider itself cannot experience joy or sadness. It cannot taste anything. It has no tingling skin or sexual desires. But all these phenomenon may be part of the rider, when the rider is part of a soul.<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep on writing. Hope my english is acceptable.<br/>

TOMAS HVM<br/>
I'm a Norwegian games designer. I published my first indie RPG (Muu) back in 1989. Since then I've published a handful of other indie RPGs. In 1999 I had the Fantasy roleplaying game Fabula published by Cappelen, a big publisher in Norway (first ever Norwegian RPG with professional distribution). This autumn I'm embarking on my most ambitious RPG-project ever; nine simple RPGgames with the label: "Playacting for the people" (loosely translated). The reverse/engineering challenge is a way of writing myself up for that prosject.                        </div>

Me. And I must say: I have no idea, what to do with that one.<br/><br/>The sheet actually implies that different organs get descriptors. The only reason I can see, is that the state of the organs plays an important role.<br/><br/>In the Grofafo Challenge in March there was an entry, where the PCs got shrunk, entered the body of a pregnant woman in a submarine, and corrected medical problems. But copying that would be lame.<br/><br/><br/>To Mark Vallianatos: Just to make to that clear, your concept is totally awesome.                        </div>

                            OK...last night I was on the upswing with <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Dirk%20Remmecke(sheetonly).pdf" rel="nofollow">Dirk's sheet</a>, but after an attempt at putting stuff into words and running things through various versions of the "3 questions", my vision crumbled into a soul-sucking vortex of despair and hopelessness. Some chatting with some other contestants and designers gave me a little grounding and some ideas for a new direction, but when I went to bed last night, I was still in the gray pit of doom.<br/><br/>So, I've decided to go with that. New working title: "Murphy's Dungeon." (First "dragons" now "dugeon"...and I don't even play DnD.)<br/><br/><b>QUESTION: What would it take to make playing a game where you're a member of a dungeon crawling party who are all doomed to die fun? Why would anybody play such a game?</b><br/><br/>In "Paranoia" you pretty much know that, asside from a couple of mutie bootlickers, everyone is going to die...probably six times. And it's fun. That's the only example of a game I would play with doomed characters. I don't want to go for quite that light a tone, but I think a game like this will need a good does of levity to make it playable.<br/><br/>I have an idea for a mechanic that should model degeneration of equipment, attributes and skills and the desperation that would bring about. I think that's what it's about: system failure and desperation. DOOM! DOOM! DOOM!                        </div>

The anime known in English as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblegum_Crisis" rel="nofollow">Bubblegum Crisis</a> was so titled as a mistranslation of "sticky situation," I think.                        </div>

Yeah, I know vagina isn't a bad word but the sheet had more than just a vagina on it, if I remember it correctly.  Maybe I'm misremembering.  Anyway, I look forward to seeing what happens with this. :-)                        </div>

                            Christian, I posted source files for Jack up here, in case you need them:<br/><a href="http://plays-well.com/reverse/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://plays-well.com/reverse/</a><br/><br/>Also, the sheet has a frickin'  "Tangut-a-Go-Go," so if you want to make it about something other than the Tangut people (like, I don't know, disco linguists), I don't think you should feel restricted.  Though you probably know more about the Tangut than I do, now.  Your thoughts on the Sky and Earth Diagrams sound hot.<br/><br/>As for myself, I got <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/TroyHoladay.pdf" rel="nofollow">Troy Holaday's sheet</a>, and I was worried about totally ignoring his carefully arranged "attribute" and "ability" blocks in favor of something completely orthagonal and ridiculous, but Troy assured me it was okay.  So I think I'm gonna pull a little <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i> and make a crime noir game about a community (a font, basically) of dingbats. The character sheet, then, is a list of all available NPCs who you might take in for questioning.                        </div>

Herr Remmecke:<br/><br/>No worries. I think I found the groove.<br/><br/>I'd be interested in hearing your intent after the contest. Right now, though, it doesn't really factor in. All that matters is what's on the sheet.<br/><br/>Things are looking up, though, so no worries. The idea that this sheet was made by you on a subway in urban Germany and, a short time later, it's over here in my suburban Alabama apartment being used by me is the one of the neat things about contests like this.                        </div>

Maybe it's my puritanical sensibilities showing through, but I have to say that the first thing I imagined when I saw that sheet was one of those Dada (or just sophomoric) mislabeled diagrams.  You know: "Analog/digital rectifier" "Glove compartment" "gravidity" "COMMUNISM!" <br/><br/>Also coming to mind are alchemical and hermetic metaphors: that the womb is a symbol of the Grail, or the alchemist's oven.                        </div>

The Da Vinci picture and reference to 'Philosophy' as an important character descriptor make me want to set the game in Italy during the Renaissance. I guess I could make a 'Da Vinci code - the rpg' here, but I'm reluctant to go that way (although a 'Foucault's Pendulum - the rpg' ... there might be something in <i>that</i>).<br/><br/>I do like the callouts from the picture. I'm pretty certain that this will be the stat block - head, arm, hand, chest, belly, thigh, calf and foot. Each will have a number &amp; descriptor and you'll add a couple of them together to use in conflict resolution. Not sure exactly how that will go.. e.g. "Is this a thigh situation or a foot one?'<br/><br/>I'm also digging the fact that apparently spritual development is as important as the effects of fatigue and health status.                        </div>

                            I think I've got off very lightly indeed. I got <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Joe%20Prince.pdf" rel="nofollow">Joe Prince</a>'s sheet, and a game practically fell off the page at me.<br/><br/>The thing that leaps off the page at me immediately aren't the stats, but the two tracks: Angst down one side, Transformation down the other. It has to be about teens who save the world by transforming into giant robots or werewolves or whatever, all the while dealing with the problems of growing up. It'll be an allegory for puberty and growing up.<br/><br/>Next on the sheet are the 3 stats: Brain, Brawn and Bio N. What the hell is Bio N? Some sort of magical power? Maybe the spiritual stat. Bio EsseNce perhaps? Bio Number? Who knows, but I bet it'll be important.<br/><br/>And then I have plenty of space for plot hooks and connections and a nemesis and a mentor, along with ranks for all. I dig that these background elements are also stats. I think they'll contribute dice to conflicts.<br/><br/>I'm thinking some sort of dice pool, with points gained in angst or transformation depending on the outcome, building towards the climax where the kids push aside their angst and team up into a giant robot/mystic warrior/super amoeba! <br/><br/>Metaphors a go go!                        </div>

<div class="Message">
<p>OK, some semi stream-ofâ€“consciousness design musings (so no comments from Brendan based on this, right?  His choice on whether to read or not though, I guess).</p>
<p>To repeat myself from the other thread, <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/brendan_adkins.pdf" rel="nofollow">my sheet from Brendan</a> rocks (Warning! 3MB .pdf).  The cards and dice speak of various mechanics (9 showing on the d12 and a 9 card showing â€“ coincidence?  Of course not), and while itâ€™ll be maddening to hammer out the specifics, the elements look very, very fruitful.</p>
<p>One thing I had trouble figuring out was the letter/symbol beginning the center-top blank space.  Iâ€™ve decided (first design decision, and a not insignificant one, as it turns out) that it is the MathML <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/script.html" rel="nofollow">MATHEMATICAL SCRIPT CAPITAL G</a>.  <strong>If anyone</strong> (besides Brendan) <strong>knows of a particular mathematical area that symbol is used for</strong> (set theory?  Calculus?  I have no clue), <strong>Iâ€™d love to know about it.</strong></p>
<p>But the real question â€“ what is this game about?  Cards and numbers pointed a bit towards tarot and/or numerology, and I googled that a bit.  Saw some possibilities in supposed vedic/hindu numerology, but nothing that really spoke to me.  Cards could also be poker, and that google turned out to be more profitable.  Modern poker is generally seen as having begun in early 19th century New Orleans.  River boats, the Frontier, Cajuns, voodoo . . . maybe.  Recent historical analysis deems that the likely inspiration for early poker can be traced as much to an old (15th century) Persian card game called â€œAs Nasâ€ (brought to New Orleans by Persian sailors?) as it is to European games like the French â€œpoqueâ€ usually cited.</p>
<p>18th-19th century Persian sailors?  Hmm . . . my google skills find very little.  Seems like there ought to be a bunch of stuff there somewhere.  Something with the Persian sailors as economic cogs in the growing world industrial machine?  An alternate history with a world power Persian empire?  There may be too much real history to sort through in my two weeks . . . huh, letâ€™s take a look at 15th century Persia.  I find a small note about Ghiyath al-Din Jamshid Mas'ud al-Kashi, a mathematician responsible for a number of little known, important (though sometimes overstated) innovations.  His first major work?  â€œThe Stairway of Heaven, on Resolution of Difficulties Met by Predecessors in the Determination of Distances and Sizes (of the heavenly bodies)â€.  â€œThe Stairway of Heavenâ€ is an almost irresistible game title, though Led Zeppelin keeps me from making that a firm decision just yet.</p>
<p>What else?  A HUGE event opens up the century- the death of Timur (Tamerlane) in 1405.  Many historical summaries just chalk up the next 100-ish years as chaos and disorder until Ismail I was declared Safavid Shah in 1501/02.  That seems to have been true in the western portion of the Timurid empire, but his fourth son ShÄh Rukh managed to maintain an empire centered in Heart and Samarkand for a good 40 years.  His son, Ulugh Beg, ruled in Samrkand and established a significant school for the study of astronomy, mathematics, and science generally (he had built a sextant nearly 200 feet in radius!  How cool is that?  Inscribed on this stone observatory are his words â€œThe religions disperse, kingdoms fall apart, but works of science remain for all ages.â€)  This is where al Kashi eventually ends up.</p>
<p>The wife of Shah Rukh, Goharshad, was no mere accessory to her husbandâ€™s rule.  She and her brothers (father was an important soldier and statesman under Timur) were highly influential, making the Persian language and customs an important part of the cosmopolitan Timurid culture.</p>
<p>On the death of Shah Rukh, Ulugh Beg briefly becomes ruler of the empire as a whole, but he has no friends among the imams, and is shortly killed, as is Goharshad.  Various flavors  of chaos now apparently do reign until the coming of the Safavids.<br/>

<p>OK, I think Iâ€™ve got it â€“ players are peers and/or rivals to al-Kashi in Smarkand, under the science-friendly rule of Ulugh Beg.  They seek to create a body of work that will somehow survive the chaotic times to come (at each otherâ€™s expense?  To what degree?  Much to figure out here, surely).  Court politics remain an issue â€“ resources are limited â€“ and the â€œwrongâ€ thoughts put into words can still be dangerous enough to get you killed.  And the image of these men (and women?  Maybe with a husband as at least a screen, a female PC can work here.  hmm â€“ and if everyone must have have a family . . . ) playing the earliest games of As Nas as they discuss their research is rather compelling.</p>
<p>Maybe K=Shah Ruhk, Q=Goharshad, J=Ulugh Beg?  Or K= Ulugh Beg, Q=The PCâ€™s family, J=al Kashi?  Wow, thereâ€™s lot to figure out here.  I donâ€™t want to go pure history, if for no other reason than thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll get it right in the time frame, and the possibilities for cultural mistakes and giving offense seem a bit high, but â€“ Iâ€™m excited by this take.  This is clearly the direction Iâ€™m going to take the game.  Thereâ€™s meat for me to chew on, thematic resonance I groove on â€“ Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m locked on target now.</p>
<p>Non-Brendan comments are enthusiastically welcome, especially on that math-script-G question.</p>

                            I am also using my <a href="http://nekobasu.livejournal.com/616147.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow">livejournal</a> as a design log. In my initial analysis of <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/christian%20griffen.pdf" rel="nofollow">Christian Griffen's sheet</a> I've decided on mythic protaganists from a non-existant, nomadic culture. They're mortal, but fueled by the reactions between two opposing gods' essences within their blood. While giving them cool powers (fearsome reputation, guided ferocity in war, and the ability to overcome everything to reach a predetermined fate), if any of these god-enhancement levels become too high something unpleasant will happen. <br/><br/>I'm proud of the short sells that I wrote, but now comes the difficulty of backing them up: Here's the short sell though: it's about being a normal person with just enough divine power to tear you apart. Also, you get to ride magical horses.<br/><br/>OK, let's try that again: it's about the fundamental existentialist dilemma. We have so much power, so much freedom that it is terrifying. The human condition these days is like if you gave a rocket launcher to a nomadic herdsman. Sure, it's impressive. Then again, it's going to take a lot to use it constructively. Also, you get to ride magical horses.                        </div>

                            It's more about identity. Say you have several computer reliefs of different landscapes. You then overlay the reliefs. <br/><br/>Then fix a point on the ground plane, for example the one 2 cm from the upper border and 5 cm from the left one. Let's call it m.<br/><br/>Germs are then classes of reliefs. Two reliefs are said to belong to the same germ, if close to m they are identical.                        </div>

                            My intitial thoughts on my task.  I've got <a href="http://kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/judson%20lester.pdf" rel="nofollow">Judson's sheet</a>.  Big circles for social maneuvers: Inquire, Deflect, Convince.  Things need to go there.  Markers, dice.  Something.  Something that changes during play, between each circle or between different player sheets.<br><br>Branch, Bent, and Charge are up there with Name.  Branch and the social interaction circles seem to say this is a spy game, but the mere fact that those circles are so freaking huge indicate that they are going to be the major focus of the game.  Spy games have explosions and chase scenes.  They're not all about social interaction.<br/><br/>The statistics bother me.  All six are equally important on the sheet, but only four are used in these freaking circles. I could make a tighter game if I left off those last two. (Nimbleness and Brawn -- an aside: my sheet submission consisted of three statistics.  Brawn was one of them.  End of aside.)  Those two tell me physical characteristics, the other four tell me more about who the person is.  Cultivation says we're dealing with a game where there are class issues.  Worldliness plus Cultivation tells me that we're dealing with characters with higher class lifestyles.  Wit and Charisma point to the social aspect of the setting.<br/><br/>High class, social skills are the primary attributes, a game of questions.  Branch.  Tree.  Elves.  The Seelie Court.  Branches are families.  Charges -- your aristocrat is tasked with a secret mission at a gathering of the Court.  The question based circles: the other players are trying to find out what you're doing?  Deflect and Convince.  I keep putting the word Suspicion after Deflect.  Convince... others of your innocence?  Okay, we're attacking in a social combat using Inquire.  You can defend by shifting blame to another with Deflect or clear yourself by using Convince.  (Or you attack using Convince and defend using Convince as well.)  Perhaps there's a murder and everyone is under suspicion?  Or is that a Charge that one of the players may have?<br/><br/>So it's a game of court intrigue.  You'll accomplish your Charge using your physical skills, but try to remain hidden or undetected using your social skills.  Meanwhile, you're trying to suck up to the Queen (or the patron of your Branch) by finding out what the others are up to.<br/><br/>Does it have to be the Seelie Court?  Could it not be any royal house and everyone is from different branches of the family tree?  Could be.  The players will have to make up the royal household and branches of the tree.  Not only do we have the character sheet that Judson created for each player, but we'd also have a character sheet that shows the heirarchy of the royal family.  The players fill this out during game session creation.<br/><br/>One game session per game that follows a structure of the meeting of the court.  You've got to accomplish your Charge before the end of the game or you fail your family's branch.  Yeah.  This could be cool.  Individual scenes, then bring everyone together in a group to run through the "I'm trying to find out what you're up to" bit.                        </br></br></div>

                            Update on mine. I have settled on a cool central idea:<br/><br/><i>Perfection</i>: A story game of renaissance utopians.<br/><br/>The characters will be a group of relatively like-minded individuals attempting to set up (and possibly maintain) a perfect community. They'll face various difficulties, such as feudal or city authorities, the church, people who think they are degenerates and so on. The callouts from Da Vinci's anatomy will be the stats - each body part will be defined as applying to certain kinds of conflicts - and pairs will be selected for conflict resolution. <br/><br/>Swordfights and riots will feature prominently, as will secret meetings and fear of informers.<br/><br/>There'll be a set number of things you have to acheive to make your (relatively) perfect society work, when that is done the story will end. There will be provision for returning to those characters/that community and dealing with problems later on in subsequent games.                        </div>

                            Gordon: the script G thing is really bothering me. If you wanted to widen the field slightly (and you may know this), a capital G can represent the Gravitational constant (in Physics) or it's used quite a bit in group theory (in Mathematics). On another note, that particular cursive G looks like the logo for Gordon's Gin, a very English brand of gin.<br/><br/>Aaron: if it helps, S, M and H are used as abbreviations for Soft, Medium and Hard (they're used in Britain for pencils, but could be applied to other things). Failing that, they suggest Slow, Medium and High Speed to me.<br/><br/>Ben: your sheet is hard, you're right. Oddly enough, that's one of the sheets I saw a while earlier and thought was very difficult. It gave me an idea for a game with lab rodents (mainly rabbits) trying to escape captivity. They'd be genetically modified and have weapons.<br/><br/>I love my <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Mike%20Sugarbaker.pdf" rel="nofollow">hot dog sheet</a>! So far, it's a horror game called "Finest", where the characters are New York City cops investigating nasty stuff as the world ends. Not quite sure what to do with the golden spiral, but the Tarot card bit at the top is gold.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I'm so sad.  I woke up yesterday and realized that the game I was designing would be a lot better if I threw out the character sheet and re-wrote it myself with different words, which sort of defeats the purpose of the contest.  So I've got one of those sheets that says "write <em>my</em> game for me."  I tried applying metaphor and it resulted in what seems like a really cool premise, but makes the character sheet vaguely ridiculous.  So now I need to start over, honor the fucking character sheet, and make the premise vaguely ridiculous.  Picture me sighing heavily.                        </div>

                            Matthijs, <br/><br/>Your sheet terrified me when I first saw it pre-assignment, but as I thought about it, I found it very evocative.  Unfortunately, I didn't end up with it.  I don't want to influence Fred's design, but if you want, I will share my initial thoughts of where I would have gone if I had gotten it.                        </div>

                            I have the setting finished and it jives with the <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Joshua%20Bishop%20Roby.pdf" rel="nofollow">character sheet </a>:<br/><br/>Somewhere, lurking in the deep reaches of space: A threat to the history. A threat to the birthrights. A threat to the past that was escaped from is coming. A small group of almost immortal warriors â€“ the Pure Knights â€“ guard the gateway to humanities history. <br/><br/>Here's a little more:<br/><br/>The Pure Knights are a tight knit group of women warriors skilled in the arts of Kung Fu and warrior robotics. Theyâ€™ve lived over 8000 earth years and as a result are becoming unseated in their minds. No human was meant to live forever. The women also have built relationships between each other. Some are friends. Some are loners. Some are enemies, but the laws bind them together to fight anyone or anything trying to find humanities past.<br/>	Most of the women identify with their genetic pasts and the 10,000 year old grudges that come with them. Some see only the future.<br/><br/>Here are the laws they must obey:<br/><br/>1.	Never abandon the singularity.<br/>2.	Never reveal the duty.<br/>3.	Never understand the past.<br/>4.	All actions are as one.<br/>5.	All is shared.<br/>6.	Create no life.<br/><br/>And a little more:<br/><br/>Using a system of neural connections, a single Knight controls a robot body almost half a mile tall. The weaponry of these armored suits dwarfs anything else humanity had developed in the past, and it is the ultimate means of striking fear into other life forms, or, at least, thatâ€™s what the Knights believe. Each Durga is powered by three cold fusion reactors and manned by 250 twos, who perform repairs and other functions during the heat of battle. The Durga are untested.<br/><br/>I'm stuck here:<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time gelling the mechanics in my head. The sheet seems to suggest that relationships are important to play, so those should be some type of resource -- I'm thinking extra dice rolls -- that the players can use when calling the relationships into play. I want the relationships to be changeable. And somehow play into the stat of Bubblegum, which as it gets larger gets closer to bursting.<br/><br/>I'm also stuck on what A and R could mean next to Kung Fu, Robotix, Bubblegum. They could be skills: Art and Reason skills, but that seems like an easy way out to me.<br/><br/>Any thoughts to unstick me would be very cool.                        </div>

                            So I wrote a bit about my game thoughts on <a href="http://ashlykos.livejournal.com/1184.html" rel="nofollow">my livejournal</a>. But, basically: cyberpunk Buddhist-conspiracy businessman. Seeking nirvana gets in there somewhere, since that's what Buddhists <em>do</em>.<br/><br/>But that begs the question: What kind of conspiracy would a bunch of <em>Buddhists</em> come up with?! At the moment (possibly due to I-should-be-asleep-right-now) all I can think of is some whacked out Da-Vinci-Code-ripoff thing involving the next Buddha, but that's meh-y. Looking for a savior is so passe.<br/><br/>At some point I'll try to figure out how to use the business cards for actual character creation/representation, rather than as part of a resolution mechanic. But I think maybe character creation will involve filling out a business card blank, and players will have rolodexes of cards with contacts and those special ones that Bryan made.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, Bryan, do you think I could get your source files for the cards?                        </div>

                            Well, I've finally figured out how to fold <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/ClaireBickellsheetonly.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Try it yourself, it is no mean feat. <br/><br/>Now I just need to finish building the context of a RPG named "Title Goes Here" where Aspect, Introspect, and Inspect are a (fairly) triad. <br/><br/>I have two different ideas, which are slowly merging. First, characters are self-aware characters within a novel. The twist being that each player is playing a character from a different novel, interacting to try to understand their world(s). Second, is a kaballah inspired meeting of scholars each with different readings of a holy book. Together they seek to map out the lightning strike and bring down the gnosis of creation. But the truth is found as much in the readers as it is in the reading. <br/><br/>In either case, the sheet will have three configurations, as it is folded into a triangular prism, with the upper quarter sticking up. I'm strongly considering linking the sheet position with some variant on the theory idea of stance, depending on whether you are in the aspecting, inspecting, or introspecting mode.<br/><br/>Mechanically I'm leaning towards a game of codes and combinations, based on the three symbols under each *spect. But to be sure that'll work I need to do some exploratory combinatorics, which is the step I'm on. <br/><br/>I could really use second opinions on the folding problem, as this could be a significant stumbling block for players. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>

                            The way I see it you fold the sheet so that the "Aspect" frame sits on top, then you can swing that down during play which exposes the "Introspect" and "Inspect" frames.                        </div>

That would make more sense if the instructions where in reverse order. That has been my biggest frustration with this sheet. It's not that I can fold it the right way, I have to pick one of the wrong ways to fold it.<br/>

I think that one's actually got a lot of potential - you just have to assume that all the whitespace is there for a reason, and use it.<br/><br/>I suggested elsewhere that it be the start of a <i>verge</i>-esque concept map.                        </div>

I've had some friends look at the sheet and they each think it should be folded as I described. In fact it doesn't seem to matter what order I fold it, I still end up with the "Aspect" frame sitting just below the top section.<br/><br/>Regardless of how it's folded, I'll be interested to see what you end up doing with it.                        </div>

Yeah, I'm feeling similarly about Graham's sheet - I'm really liking the mechanics that have developed from it, but am having trouble finding a particular setting or settings that they evoke.  I think I need to *play* them a few times to see what sort of settings they speak to.  That, or embrace collaborative-setting-building in the beginnings of play.<br/><br/>- D.J.                        </div>

                            Well, I'm just going to keep the triangular prism shape. Losing that will require another ground up re-design. And at least one person did that as soon as I handed him the sheet. I will be interested sometime in finding out the intended shape of the sheet, although best after the competition. I admit it is difficult to unambiguously mark foldings using only one side of the paper, I could see using a diagram of the folding steps.<br/>

                            I've thrown about a few mechanics for Bio-N this past week and have sorted out the game play and how angst and transformation work with one another, but am struggling to decide how to go about rolling the dice without making myself huge problems with balance issues. Some feedback would be appreciated.<br/><br/>Dice pool seems inevitable, as I've never really played with dice pools before. But they involve more complicated maths ... Boo to complicated maths. Here's what I'm thinking so far though. Three possible options. All involve pools of dice based on one stat + powers + bonus dice from stuff.<br/><br/>Option 1: Roll pool of dice. Put 1s and 6s to one side, add up the remainder and compare to a fixed target number to determine success or failure. 1s are angst dice and 6s are transformative. Add any angst or transformative to the trackers. The one that dominates flavours the conflict outcome â€“ so a conflict that rolled more 6s than 1s is transformative, and therefore the conflict, failure or success, is transformative somehow.<br/><br/>Option 2: Roll pool of dice, each dice that rolls a 1-3 is a failure, a 4-6 a success. Compare number of successes to a fixed target number. Success earns a notch of angst, failure earns a notch of transformative.<br/><br/>Option 3: Roll pool of dice, 1s failure, 2-6s success. Compare number of successes to current angst tracker. Success earns a notch of angst, failure = notch of transformative. So number of successes ranges from 1 to 13!<br/>I'm quite fond of option 3 right now, but I think the maths involved to balance it will blow my mind. So it's a toss up between 2 and 3. <br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>

As for what I'm doing with it, I've got a clockface and a d12 and I'm not afraid to use 'em.<br/>
<br/>
I fought off the initial desire to take the question: "Are you Dead or are you Sleeping?" and make an alien gods game, a la Cthulhu meets Teenagers From Outerspace, where you play pandimensional beings converting cultists and taking names.<br/>
<br/>
I just hope the direction I did go works out okay.  I want to flesh it out more, but we have less than a week.  Back to the grind stone.  I'll check back in a few days.                        </div>

                            Martin: beats me! That sheet seems impossible! ;-)<br><br/>A game about moral, in a more direct sense?<br/>A game where the "player dedication" is quantified on the sheet, to make the players conscious of their personal stakes in the game?<br/>A game that makes it difficult for the players to "do the right thing"?<br/>A game about fire?<br/>A game about being "in the wave"?<br/><br/>Or do you need a setting more than an ideology?<br/><br/>I don't know how to help you, really. Can't design it for you. Hope to see some game though. Good luck!                        </br></div>

                            Martin, if it helps, here's the first thing you read in my entry:<br/><br/>"This game was written for the 2006 Story Games Reverse Engineering Challenge.  I was assigned Ashok Desai's character sheet, which directly inspired this game.  I realized at some point that my design would be better served without it, so I left it behind in the service of fun and hopefully playability.  The first draft clung assiduously to Ashok's sheet, framing the game around the insurgent cells within Richmond college's faculty of biology, with protective social membranes and whatnot, but it stretched the metaphor a little thin and I gave up trying."<br/><br/>I feel <em>so much better</em> having made that choice.  I may get kicked in the nuts by my peers, but I made a fun thing.                        </div>

                            Martin, I'll share my first reactions to the sheet.  Maybe one will help you out.<br/><br/>The first thing that jumps to my mind when I see the sheet is 'island' and, for some reason, 'pacific island tribal' follows quickly on its heels.  A game about tribal authority?  Tribal social interactions more broadly?  Struggling to maintain good relations with each other in a closed environment with few resources (getting away from pacific island tribal towards Lost or something)?                        </div>

                            I wrote my introduction:
<blockquote>To play a full game of Angels of Tangut youâ€™ll need a few friends who wish to play and are happy to commit to playing it across a number of sessions. Youâ€™ll typically need four to six people, who will be collectively referred to as a Troupe.  The first time you get together, youâ€™ll spend your time creating a world to play in and creating characters to play in that world. Every time you get together after that, youâ€™ll take turns taking on a special role called the GM, everyone whoâ€™s not GMing will be referred to as a player. As GM, youâ€™ll have a special position of responsibility and authority, creating and balancing a situation into which the other players will take their characters. When being a player, youâ€™ll take sole charge of an Angel of Tangut and your choices will shape both the character you are creating through play and the eventual outcome of your imaginary world. These choices will centre on certain symmetries such as pleasure and pain or love and hate.</blockquote> </div>

Dang it!  I was really looking forward to seeing what you'd do with it.  Oh, well.<br/><br/>I'll give this contest at least this much: you have a decided investment in seeing how certain games shake out, and in the opinion of at least one other player on your game.                        </div>
