It is available now as a Public Beta, to be improved over the course of the next few months into a final release. The PDF is nearly 300 pages long and in full color with stunning art donated by artists from around the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is a completely open-ended universal system with strong emphasis on character depth and personality. The primary elements of a character are seven mental attributes, including the namesake Synapse. In addition to these, your character chooses from 21 talents to customize precisely what their brain is good (and bad) at. This brain is then placed in a physical body. Build a race using a point-buy system from nearly a hundred biological characteristics; ranging from mandibles to turtle shells to wings to echolocation. This is followed by a similar system for culture where you define the society from which your character springs. Build any culture from Ancient Egypt to the Galactic Empire. Your character is the given life experiences using another point-buy system, where you make choices about your education, siblings, parentage, and more. All of these systems feed into a personality model to build a unique personality from 22 different motivation values. You define what exactly drives your character in their daily life. Choose from six morality models that go far beyond good and evil. On top of this, you build a network of NPCs which your character has met over the years. These NPCs integrate you into the social fabric of the game world, providing resources, contacts, allies, and more. Finally, choose from a long list of skills for any setting you need and buy your starting equipment (or property, if you are rich enough). As you can see, this game generates characters of stunning complexity. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game uses a d6 success-based mechanic to determine success/failure at tasks. The combat system involves a bullet-time model that resolves quickly and decisively. The game also includes a conversational mechanic where you can pick and choose motivational appeals to make in your adversaries to influence their decisions. Even if you choose poorly, you get a few chances to attempt to get the conversation back on track. It also has a standard roll-vs-difficulty and a manuever mechanic that works for chase scenes; from horses to starfighters. Your body is represented by three values; strength, endurance, and resilience (resistance to toxin/disease). You can take damage to these values independently as if they were different kinds of hit points. You also track mental stress to determine how well your mind is able to keep it together under adverse circumstances. As you take stress, you start to get shaky and make mistakes. If you reach a critical stage, your brain shuts down and you withdraw into a catatonic state and cower on the floor. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince the game emphasizes the brain and not the physical form, it easily supports any setting. Your mental skills are used to run all the mechanics, not your body. Instead of drawing upon your physical body, simply replace your body with the values of a giant Mech and take to the field as if you were merely a giant armored combatant. Build a new body as a vampire, choosing from dozens of vampiric powers. Or teach yourself magic and choose from dozens of magical abilities. <br/>\n<br/>\nSynapse is a powerful character development engine that can be used to play any setting, any genre, any game that you desire. You owe it to yourself to check it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nDOWNLOAD FROM HERE: www.synapserpg.com/download                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288894/#Comment_288894" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T20:44:14+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  8:44PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am trying to download it, but the 27 mg PDF via direct download is a touch challenging.

This is a great work (both in game concept and in your choices of artwork). The mechanics are similar to "d6 Legends" but much more in depth in its scope. Although I do like quick-start rules, but I'm not sure you could accomplish what is conveyed if you used a "lighter" paradigm. Still, from my first read through I believe that <b>after </b>character creation everything would move along at a nice pace. Your approach reminds me of the "front loaded" method that is used in Harn. I'm not so sure I'd take as many risks in play if the character creation process is as heavy as it looks. Still, that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>It is great to see Social, Life Experience &amp; Cultural aspects woven into the creation process. I also like the examples in all three of the Templates Chapters (especially the Cultural Templates). Great stuff...<br/><br/>A lot of information to soak in, but it certainly has jump started my mind into thinking of different directions and genres one could use <b>Synapse</b>. Also, (if one had the time), creating a random generator for any segment of creation might be a nice inspiration for creating worlds, cultures and individuals one might not have designed without the element of chance.<br/><br/>Anyway, I just wanted to say that I am impressed and believe that you've really got something good going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ryoken" title="ryoken"><img alt="ryoken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ryoken">ryoken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288973/#Comment_288973" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T11:51:44+00:00" title="August 26, 2010 11:51AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Wothbora<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks! You are absolutely right about the pace of play. The game is front-loaded. I have run several playtests and the actual gameplay flowed very very fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used the game in several genres myself so far. I have yet to encounter problems. My favorite has been Serenity/Firefly because my combat resolves like a high-noon gunfight, which really fits the genre, and each character creates a culture which makes a planet for the universe without any GM work, and the Connections each character makes form the NPC network to provide them with tasks. You could kinda run a Serenity/Firefly Sandbox game with it, because it moves the burden of that kind of worldbuilding onto the PCs. You don't have to design every innkeeper because they are going to go to the inn where they KNOW the innkeeper already because he is their connection. I think it solves a lot of problems that GMs face.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the praise and keep your ideas coming.

No worries there at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe past 9 months I have been listening to hundreds of hours of podcasts. Nearly every major podcast has an episode about PDFs. I have paid special attention to these. The most frequent complaint that I have heard in those podcasts is that the books are layed out in columns. As a result, when you are reading on the screen, you have to scroll down, then up again, then down again, on every page. This gets really annoying. Therefore, I decided to design the book with no columns on purpose, to see if people really preferred reading it that way. I could have designed in columns if I wanted to, I just felt like both from my personal experience reading PDFs and from my observations of discussions happening among veteran RPG players on podcasts is that column formats are annoying on the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally have had no eye strain from reading in that style. In fact, right now I am reading a smaller font than I use in my book to read this forum and it causes me no problems. That is not to diminish your concern in any way, I am just relaying my personal experience. I would suggest that you view the PDF full-screen with a slight zoom. The letters are larger and easier to read. That has worked for my wife.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, all that being said, when the game goes to a final version it will be available in five or six styles; portrait columnless, landscape columnless, both types with columns, maybe a version in spreads, and maybe a 5 inch version for an iPhone or other PDA.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for the praise on art direction. I used a special top-secret method to get artist donations. I dont want to get my method in the public for fear that it will be harder on my next book. In the desert, you keep the location of water to yourself, if you know what I mean. However, I will be clear that I did have a coherent strategy that I employed and it worked quite well in terms of bringing in donations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can appreciate your concerns on the red. I have played with several colors and they just didnt feel right to me. I used up all the colors that I really like. The last color I created, for example, was the magic color which is still a little too bright for my tastes but when you are dealing with 10 different colors it is hard to make them all work. The spectrum is only so flexible, you know. I will think on this matter though. I hadnt made the connection between vampire and heading both being reds. Maybe I can make vampire a darker red.... I'll ponder it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the Artic, you are right. However, the degree to which the general public knows that is what concerns me. My main concern is emphasizing that this terrain would apply to areas that are "continental". I didnt want the concept to be totally solid ice (like at the North Pole) but also extreme mountain environments like northern Scandinavia (which I really should mention in that description, now that I think about it) as well as the areas north of the tundra on the plains of Siberia.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Misuba<br/>\n<br/>\nSome descriptions are coming up in a few minutes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ryoken" title="ryoken"><img alt="ryoken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ryoken">ryoken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289055/#Comment_289055" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T19:51:34+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  7:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doh, Jason whispered his comment to me.

Here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have so far run the game in three settings; medieval fantasy, napoleonic, and Firefly/Serenity. This was with my group of friends and they are big on fantasy and sci-fi. I wanted to run a kind of Count of Monte Cristo adventure in the Napoleonic era, so I kinda forced that on them. I would have liked to have done a lot more testing. However, my wife got pregnant about 1 month into starting on this project and gave birth on the August 6th a few days ago. So in the past few months, my personal time has gotten tighter and tighter and I have cut playtesting in favor of writing because it has been easier on my schedule. <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally, my group reacted to the game in the following ways. I noticed significant changes in their behavior from previous play.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the Connections component gave them a lot more avenues to resolve their problems that didnt involve direct confrontation or significant hardships. When I would present a problem, they would frequently go to their Connections and ask them for their opinions, advice, help, etc. They had never really done that before with NPCs. I think the Connection setup places a lot of agency in the hands of the player with respect to creating the social fabric in the game world. So they created these NPCs and by god they were determined to get full value out of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, the level of wealth that the average character gets is pretty high. Some characters are going to have significant wealth. In both the Napoleonic and Medieval Fantasy games, one character was titled nobility. This removed a lot of the impetus for "MUST HAVE TREASURE" that dominates a lot of games. They were much more cautious, investigatory, patient, and cunning than in previous games I had played with them. Like someone who has a full belly, they were more picky about their meals compared to a starving person. The energy that they previously had devoted to acquiring possessions was redirected into their social interactions with the world around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, in every game there was one optimized combat build. In Firefly and Medieval Fantasy, there were two. However, they didnt really need more than that. Because someone who is good at combat is REALLY good at combat. They can hold of several generic enemies like goblins and such. They can win the gunfights. They can dominate. Someone who is a badass may take out 4 stormtroopers before they even realize they are being shot at. So the other characters had a lot of freedom to explore other avenues of non-combat specialization; engineering/mechanics, academics, or piloting; without fear of being outclassed in a fight. You only need a couple Han Solos and you are pretty safe to do whatever you want with the other characters. One reason I think this is really a profound change is that it opens up a lot of territory that has historically been rougher for gaming; the Indiana Jones kinda game, the Jurassic Park kinda game, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly and most importantly, the character creation process has been phenomenally engaging. People really really identify with their characters. We have a guy in our group who has historically been pretty apathetic. He is typically a basic fighter build in whatever game we run. He doesnt really care that much about what is going on, he is really there for socialization, and he doesnt read much of the rules. Well, when this guy built his character it was like a light came on. He was psyched. He was designing this cool lizardman race. Seriously pondering what kind of culture these lizard people would have. He was mapping out this guy's life and personality. What he cared about, what he wanted, etc. This guy was totally engaged with this character. I just don't know how to quantify the magic that happened with this guy, it was really profound.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my best suggestion to anyone thinking about this game is make a character. Go through the experience. You will really have a unique experience and I think you will be sold on the concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289124/#Comment_289124" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T07:24:09+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  7:24AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't downloaded the document yet - waiting for a larger download to finish first - but I thought I'd chip in and say the character sheet... please tell me it's only a temporary measure.

Also, I found a lot of the single-column text a touch awkward to read. In a larger page book, I generally prefer a double column layout.

Things that are clumsy, that seem too complex for what is needed, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I am kinda on the fence about declared actions in combat. This is not so much because I feel like it is a bad idea on paper. I actually think it is a great idea. My problem is that people (myself included) tend to not remember to declare actions and just head right into the Synapse phases because unless they play a lot of Burning Wheel they are just not used to declaring actions. So is declaring actions too burdensome or is it work demanding that people do it?<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things I am looking for are elements to put into choices that I left out. For example, I forgot webbed feet as an option under race. I noted this on my blog. If someone sees some kind of augment, vision type, etc that I am missing, I want to know about it. My goal is for the racial section to let you build any race you want. So if anyone wants to build some race but lacks the components, I want to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as my personal views, I am concerned about adding more magic powers, vampiric powers, and setting-based skills into the game.

From what I understand, you pretty much have to disabuse yourself of notions of "pages" when making an epub book, as user choices (for font size, etc.) and device differences (screen size, etc.) make "pages" more of an abstract concept. Still, it is <a href="http://images.apple.com/ipad/features/images/ibooks_habits_20100225.jpg" rel="nofollow">clearly possible</a> to get images at least roughly where you want them (e.g. anchored to the start or end of a particular paragraph, say, as your PDF does all over the place).
