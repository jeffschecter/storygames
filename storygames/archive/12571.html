You might be surprised sometimes: sometimes it seems like they ALL apply (which is no fun) and sometimes you'll find a character is lacking effectiveness.<br/><br/>For instance, a Robin Hood character:<br/><br/><b>Archer</b><br/>Trick Shot, Blindfolded, That's Impossible!, Close Quarters, King's Men, Contest of Skill<br/><br/>It looks like there's lots of Tags, but then if you have your Robin Hood just firing at an enemy in a routine combat situation, he's only going to be rolling two dice. He'll be doing great in difficult/unusual situations and contests, but it might be frustrating for a player to suddenly be useless when they just need to hunt down a deer or something.<br/><br/>Now, here's what I consider a bad Trait from the original Lady Blackbird (though I don't think it's John Harper's, but a suggestion from someone else):<br/><br/><b>Bold</b><br/>Brave, Daring, Heroic, Rescue, Falling, Fire, Reckless, Explosions, Escapes, Outnumbered, Underdog<br/><br/>The Tags towards the end are great (I think). But the first four are totally redundant. I think it was sort of the point, to make it a powerful Trait, but it's just too widely applicable. In an action adventure-type game and given a character who is stereotypically brave/bold, they can just roll this Trait all the time and get at least four dice (Bold, Brave, Daring, Heroic). I find that a little too broad, although in a different genre (where acting heroically is less common) it might work really well. But we played a game and it was kind of boring to have this one character be able to do pretty much anything, as long as they could conceivably do it boldly, with this one Trait.<br/><br/>I've got more to say about Keys, but I'll have to come back when I have more time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282404/#Comment_282404" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T09:55:36+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  9:55AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Lady Blackbird is kind of all about Vance and Lady B, right? There's lots of other stuff going on, but at its core it's a game about those two, their secret (unrequited?) love, and the directions that all the other characters pull them in. Everything about it (Kale's drive for money but loyalty to Vance, Flint's hold on Lady B, etc) is really about enhancing or reflecting that core relationship.<br/><br/>Not to say that you can't do lots of other things with the playset, but I think that's the core of it.<br/><br/>So I'd suggest that a really good Lady Blackbird hack has that kind of central issue too.

That's kind of cool, but the characters were a little flat: they all had reasons to get Billy, reasons they might hate each other, reasons to work together, but they felt a little empty.<br/><br/>Then I talked to John about Lady Blackbird and a few other things happened that got me thinking about father/son relationships, and I started funneling that into the game. Now there's what I think of as almost a central relationship between Doc and Lawrence Scurlock, a kind of strained father/son thing that plays out in awesomely different ways depending who's at the table. The other characters kind of reflect that, and may change how those two players view each other (kind of like Kale might drag Vance off on a wild heist instead of romancing LB).<br/><br/>So far I've run Old Mesilla three times. Doc has always been a player character, one time Lawrence was an NPC but the rest he was a player. The game's still certainly about the heist, how you free Billy and what you do with him afterwards, but some of the best bits of play come from seeing the dynamic between Doc and Lawrence. I think the same is true of Lady Blackbird: the Vance/LB relationship is kind of a core thing, and I think that can be used in a lot of other LB hacks. Make a central issue that everyone can kind of hang on.<br/><br/>I guess what that makes different for me is that it feels like the game has a theme in the sense that a book or movie might: it's almost about something, and you don't have to play towards the theme artifically, the characters are just kind of poised to explore it. LB is kind of about forming a family, of sorts, and Old Mesilla is kind of the same, but focused on a particular familial bond and what people will do with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282595/#Comment_282595" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T07:35:21+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  7:35AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I've got this rough idea for how to set up a Blackbird-style quickstart for Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple.

After a bit more thought: here's a couple good memes to follow for making Avatar-style problem-of-the-week situations:<br/><br/>1. The world of adults is full of things (often: traditions) that are obviously ridiculous and, additionally, is corrupted by unfair power relationships. No adults question these things.  Kids who are striving to live in the world of adults or who are being pushed prematurely into adulthood (like the Fire Nation kids who can't dance), rarely question them, but will quickly see them for what they are when other kids point them out, unless they are too far gone (Jet, Azula, Zuko for a long time).<br/><br/>2. One of the primary purposes of having children as protagonists is for them to use basic logic and moral clarity to see through and question these unjust, silly things, and to challenge and eventually change them to be more fair or at least silly in a harmless way rather than a dangerous one.<br/><br/>So make things that are ridiculous (cake-baking contest!)... and then corrupt them with unfair power relationships (the loser is executed!).  Then you've made a space for the characters to intervene, though you can't really know HOW they will decide to intervene or what the outcome will be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282834/#Comment_282834" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-25T17:30:35+00:00" title="July 25, 2010  5:30PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2010 5:35PM by sage.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Lady Blackbird-ish advice I have for that is to make sure that whatever you see as the core issue of the scenario (unjust power, or whatever) is reflected in each of the characters, or they're tied to it somehow.

But kids also learn very quickly that adults have arbitrary and often unfair authority over them.  Kids can argue with adults about this, but the kids always lose, just because they are kids.  This seems (and is) horribly unfair.<br/><br/>These unfair relationships quickly develop among children.  Bullies boss people around for no good reason.  Some things only girls are allowed to do, or only boys.  Older kids are allowed to do things younger kids aren't, and vice-versa.<br/><br/>But kids eventually realize that these unfair relationships exist between adults too.  Adults, despite what children may initially think, are not free to do whatever they want while children are slaves to their parents and older siblings.  This seems ASTONISHINGLY unfair, because kids grow up hearing "when you're older you can _________" and often envision adulthood as this paradise of freedom.  They didn't put all this hard work into growing up just to find themselves in another unfair prison of arbitrary rules and silly traditions.<br/><br/>So Avatar is about kid-empowerment because it allows the protagonists to have authority (especially with Aang as the avatar and the group as savers-of-the-world) and the ability (as powerful benders mostly, but Sokka has his own methods) to interfere not just in the world of children (though many episodes start there, with the kids interacting with local kids and addressing their issues) but in the world of adults, freeing both kids and adults from the fundamental unfairness of everything, which kids perceive much more readily than the adults who think "this is just the way it is."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
