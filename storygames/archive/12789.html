Weird eh? The fact is, my mother (a great reader of historical fiction), has always known but not quite understood my passion for games-as-stories. <em>A Taste for Murde</em>r looked, to me, like a great re-opener for that ageing conversation.<br/><br/>We talked for some time about the game's concept: We create characters in a <em>Jeeves &amp; Wooster</em> story, one of us has done murder, but no one knows who the culprit is. During play, uncovering motive through heated dialogue, we end up with two suspects\u2014and it's not until the last few minutes that we learn which of us has done the deed. Wow. Great concept. Think of it like <strong>Cluedo + Drama x Exquisitve Corpse</strong>. It's the type of game that produces witty theatre.<br/><br/>It got me excited: Finally, I had found a story game for <i>real </i>people. That is, I found a game that I could play with the <i>real people in my life</i>: my friends, the partners of my friends, my family, maybe even my mum (\u201cWe can try it at Christmas,\u201d she had suggested enthusiastically).<br/><br/>So, for the rest of the review, now you know how it affected me personally, I\u2019m going to speak to the writer to highlight his strengths and point out where I got confused.

Except replace "my mother" with "my girlfriend". She's a big Agatha Christie fan and I wanted to show her what was awesome about games, so I combined the two.
