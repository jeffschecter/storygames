There were little diagrams with comic-style arrows, and an overall well-worded essay on the topic, and I desperately want to find it again, but my google-fu has repeatedly failed on countless attempts.<br/><br/>I'm fairly confident that it was authored by a story game designer, but I could be wrong.  <br/><br/>Does anyone know what I'm talking about?  Do you recognize the post I'm thinking of?  Maybe this is a needle-in-a-haystack, but I've had a half-dozen attempts to find it when a discussion I was privvy to broached the subject, and it really bothers me that I can't track it down.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387190/#Comment_387190" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T10:54:48+00:00" title="August 15, 2012 10:54AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2012 10:56AM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Was it <a href="http://lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>?<br/><br/>Or poke around at the <a href="http://lumpley.com/opine.html" rel="nofollow">lumpley blog</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387216/#Comment_387216" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T14:03:25+00:00" title="August 15, 2012  2:03PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan Macklin recently did <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2012/08/the-whiff-factor/" rel="nofollow">this post on the subject of the whiff factor</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
