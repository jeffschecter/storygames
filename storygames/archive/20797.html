I still love the game, but I'm playing D&amp;D 5e these days.<br/><br/>13th Age is a love letter to D&amp;D, written by Jonathan Tweet and Rob Heinsoo. Apparently, it was their house rules and they liked it enough to turn it into a product. As one might expect from the lead designers of D&amp;D 3e and D&amp;D 4e, it combines some of the interesting aspects of both games and adds an equal part of story game sensibility to come up with a different kind of play experience.<br/><br/>At its core, it's a D&amp;D game (it's OGL). You have the six standard abilities scored 3-18, you have races and classes, you have feats and stuff like that. Those parts of the game feel like a cross between 3e and 4e and tend to be "squishy" in terms of game design. That is, this is not a tightly designed wargame like 4e was meant to be, or a finely tunable character ladder like 3e was meant to be. There are clearly some character options which are better than others.<br/><br/>But it really doesn't matter, because the rest of the game doesn't care. Encounter building is hand-wavy, but there are lots of trap doors to get players out of TPK situations, and while combat is an important part of the game, there's a lot of focus on other stuff.<br/><br/>Some of the clever bits.<br/><br/><b>Backgrounds.</b> Characters have all the usual D&amp;D stuff, and some surprises. They have "backgrounds" instead of skills. You can write "leader of the Black Stones thieves' guild in Hammertown" as a background, give it 3 points, and then add +3 whenever you can convince the GM that it applies to a skill check, which is probably most of the time. Basically, you're a +3 badass because you were a thieves' guild leader in Hammertown.<br/><br/><b>Icons.</b> There are 13 icons, who are mortal, but very powerful NPCs who iconify some aspect of the world, and have political alliances and agendas. They are powerful, but they have fought to a stalemate and need people like the PCs to help shift the balance. Each PC has relationships (good or bad) with a couple Icons and those relationships are useful in play. Also, the GM uses Icon rolls at the beginning of a session to get plot prompts based on those Icons.<br/><br/><b>One Unique Thing.</b> Every player writes "One Unique Thing" about their characters. This is player authoring / player narrative control over the setting. Sure, the GM or other players could go, "Nah, dude, not cool to have UFOs in this campaign," but they can do that in any game. The "Unique" is often interpreted as "you are the only character that this can be said about..." I had a player say that his Unique was that his elf had infravision, which seemed kind of dull, but then I realized, "Hey, this means that you are the <i>only</i> character in the world that has infravision. You just made infravision cool!" It has no mechanical power, but it has tons of narrative power.<br/><br/><b>Theater of the Mind.</b> Combat handwaves all distances and ranges and facing. It's designed for theater of the mind, but plays well with minis if you want. Combat movement uses rough zones like "engaged," "adjacent," "nearby," "far away" and so on. There are combat moves (class abilities, I think) that let you intercept people when they're moving. Engagement rules are intuitive and <i>fun.</i><br/><br/><b>Run Away.</b> I think the rule is called Flee, actually. If you want to get out of a fight, and can't get away normally, you can Flee. That gets you out of the combat. Everyone who is still alive gets away with their lives. But you must accept the GM's "Story Setback," which will be painful and costly. <br/><br/><b>Escalation Die.</b> The game has an acceleration mechanic that makes combats faster. You use a d6 to track the PCs' attack bonus, and it increments every round. On round 1, every PC gets +0 to hit. On round 2, it increases to +1. On round 3, +2, and so on up to +6 on round 7. There are little mechanical rules that do more with that mechanic, too, like monsters that can't do anything till the escalation die is +4 or something.<br/><br/><b>Clever Combat Mechanics.</b> The class write-ups are chock full of super smart and super fun mechanics. Rogues have abilities they can use only if they have Momentum, and they gain Momentum by hitting an enemy and lose it when they get hit by an enemy. Fighters have special attacks and powers that can be used only when they roll a natural odd or natural even result, so what's available to them might change depending on the roll. Combat is pretty fast to play--probably on par with 5e. <br/><br/><b>Mooks.</b> I love the Mook rule, which designates "minion"-type monsters as being easy to kill. Say you want to drop 20 goblins into an encounter. Use 20 goblin mooks, each with 5 hit points. Each operates as a single monster, but when you do damage to <i>any mook,</i> you're attacking all of them. For every 5 points of damage you do, you kill a mook, even if you have to get creative with how that happened. Rolled 10 points of damage with your bow but only one mook is nearby? "You shoot through the neck of the goblin in front of you, slay him, and the arrow continues through to the goblin behind that rock, killing it, too!" It's super easy to have encounters with large numbers of monsters and have it all be manageable.<br/><br/><b>The Setting.</b> The setting is this little generic fantasy world, which looks like nothing special at all, except it's deeply connected to the Icons and its description (which is really just 10-20 pages, tops) is peppered with amazing little details that set your imagination on fire. "Highport: Where the stars dock. At least those who go in for that kind of thing." (paraphrased) The equipment list gives the price of a cat, and also a cat free of fleas. Sometimes it's humorous but it's always interesting. <br/><br/>I do fear that I can't do the game justice. There's just so much of the game that is so well done. I'm not saying it's perfect, because it does have some game balance issues and it requires a lot of creativity to really make it shine. <br/><br/>The main thing that seems to happen--and I'm not entirely sure why because it's not codified in the rules--but it produces a very different kind of play than standard D&amp;D, yet manages to feel like <i>epic</i> D&amp;D. I think the character creation options that give players some narrative control (backgrounds, Uniques, Icon relationships) help set up the players with a "let's all make up cool stuff" mentality.<br/><br/>Note that there's nothing stopping you from importing those character things into your D&amp;D game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456653/#Comment_456653" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T18:25:51+00:00" title="September 27, 2016  6:25PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2016 2:05AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a><br/>Adam, thanks so much for the  thorough and informative write-up.

I also remember liking the way that progress was tracked -- I can't remember whether it was "you accomplished something during the bit we fast-forwarded through" or "the group gets measurably closer to completion of stated mission" or just regular old XP, but I know there was something fun somewhere in there.<br/><br/>Main vulnerability I recall is that "be a good trad GM" might be required.

You get an advancement every four good fights, which also happens to be when you get to reset your "daily" abilities. Every time you advance, you get to pick one of the cool things from your next level. On the fourth advancement, you get the remainder of them. The rules encourage the group to do a "campfire"-type scene where the PCs talk about what they learned.<br/><br/>The four-fights-per-daily thing means that you can't just go sleep every time you get low on spells. You literally have to keep fighting. I generally give my players a bit of a bye and count any encounter with important stakes as a "fight."<br/><br/>Though I don't think it's codified in the rules, the 13th Age Organized Play games (written mostly by ASH Law) introduce the idea of a "montage" to get to the fun stuff. Instead of exploring a dungeon hallway-by-hallway, the GM turns it into a montage. "Conan, you encounter a trap. What is it and how do you overcome it?" "Hermione, the room you're in locks and starts flooding. How do you save everyone?" There's a version with skill checks that looks a little like 4e's Skill Challenges, except not totally broken, if I recall.<br/><br/><b>Downsides</b><br/><br/>I mentioned <i>some</i> of the downsides above. Here's a recap and some more that I can think of. I realize that some of these are features, not bugs, to some people (even to me, sometimes).<br/><br/>The combat math is a bit squishy, especially at higher levels. Encounters are unpredictable.<br/><br/>Classes can be pretty complex. Fighter isn't a default "Easy mode" class (but barbarian is). <br/><br/>Backgrounds-as-skills often results in a mode of play where any background can do anything.<br/><br/>It's designed for freewheeling play, with not a ton of structure for GMs beyond what D&amp;D gives you. Arguably, that's plenty, if you stick to dungeons and combats. Yeah, you have to be a good trad GM.<br/><br/>There are no social mechanics. It's either a skill check or role-play+GM fiat.<br/><br/>It's tricky to port the game to another setting without retooling some of the class stuff, because the Icons are integrated into spells and stuff like that. It's actually trickier to come up with a good set of custom Icons than one might think. <br/><br/>There aren't a ton of monsters in the core book, though a later supplement (which might have been 3rd party?) helped out a lot. Still, you can reskin pretty easily. Making your own monsters can be challenging because the combat system has lots of little quirks that make monsters interesting.<br/><br/>It's still just basically D&amp;D (though tending towards more epic action where PCs matter). If you're not a fan of D&amp;D, look at the reasons why. Maybe 13th Age is different enough for you, but maybe not.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456692/#Comment_456692" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-28T14:46:34+00:00" title="September 28, 2016  2:46PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I wrote my "Murder Mysteries in D&amp;D" article for D&amp;D Insider, I wanted to playtest my ideas, so I wrote a murder adventure for 13th Age (and ran it at a few conventions).<br/><br/>It generally was entirely skill checks and role-playing, and no combat at all, though sometimes the very end confrontation with the murderer turned into a fight, if there was time. In the "just role-playing and not fighting" mode, you're ignoring 50% of the rules of the game. <br/><br/>It's still fun, and it's a little more than skill checks because every time you engage a "skill," you're explaining how your <i>background</i> applies and it develops your backstory. You also have your One Unique Thing to play off.<br/><br/>Also, in combat-free zones, you still have your Icon relationships pushing the plot around in interesting ways that tie into what <i>you wrote</i> about how you relate to the movers and shakers of the world (though my murder mystery adventure totally ignored Icons).<br/><br/>Oh, another cool thing I forgot. One of my favorites:<br/><br/><b>Rituals.</b> There's a feat that lets you be a <i>Ritual Caster</i>. That means that you can cast very powerful magical effects that aren't spells, and the requirements are generally worked out between you and the GM in a story-fantastic way.<br/><br/>Want to curse an entire town? You'll need to craft a custom ritual for that. The GM might say, "Sure, but you need to sacrifice a goblin over a gold-inlaid marble dais on a full moon, and use up a 1st level <i>curse (bless)</i> spell."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456693/#Comment_456693" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-28T14:54:35+00:00" title="September 28, 2016  2:54PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a>\n<blockquote>There are no social mechanics.

I love that they are learning from "indie" RPGs and introducing more narrativist elements and cutting down on the crunch, but the social mechanics are something they really need to focus on--"roll a d20 for lie detection," just doesn't cut it for everyone anymore. I almost want to retool the social mechanics for 5E, and publish them online, just so people who want to go that direction have a good option. I want to assuage the fear that social mechanics equal restrictions on roleplaying, as a lot of D&amp;D players I've talked to fear.

I'm very much talking about my own opinion and journey here; so this is what "holds them back" for me. I used to exclusively play D&amp;D and I didn't really see a world beyond it. Eventually, I tried other games and saw what they could offer me. I tried to emphases this by saying <i>IMO</i>, "doesn't cut it for <i>everyone</i> any more" and "[for] <i>people who want to go in that direction</i>, (sorry if this sounds like I'm defending my self); as I very much can see that I came off as elitist. What I should have said is that I play D&amp;D 5E and I personally would like to see more social mechanics in the game. Obviously, the success and resurgence of D&amp;D shows that they are not being "held back" and are fulfilling a lot of needs for players who are very happy with the system as is. I very much respect traditional approaches to RPGs and my preferences only speak to my own tastes and certainly not some objective reality. I hate it when I come off as despairing or judge-y of others tastes in games as the reason we have all these options is so that people can go toward the direction they find most enjoyable personally <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I meant no ill-will, sorry for being careless in my post <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> And thank you again for all the effort you put into your responses <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456740/#Comment_456740" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-29T16:00:02+00:00" title="September 29, 2016  4:00PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a> <br/>I wish there was a "I respect that" button for other peoples posts, so we can encourage people when they stay cool and explain themselves nicely. Also a "not cool dude" button would probably be good too.
