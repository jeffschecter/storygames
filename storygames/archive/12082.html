I think you can use it to add collaborative story telling to any traditional-ish RPG.  This is basically doing a REALLY simplified version of Universalis at the start of each session:<br/><br/>1) Each player gets a certain number of story points that they can spend to state vignettes.  A vignette can be a paragraph or two or three.  It could be a continuation of the current scene or a scene in a different time and/or place.  I think we used 3 points, but it could have been 5 -- I don't remember.<br/><br/>2) The GM can veto any vignette<br/><br/>3) A player can veto a vignette that involves their character<br/><br/>4) The GM can issue more points<br/><br/>Vetoing: try never to veto.  Try to work with what the player is saying without changing it at all (just adding to it with a "yes, and..." technique).  If changes are unavoidable, try to get the player to make the change instead of you doing it.  If it totally can't work in any way, veto is a last resort.  If a player's vignette is vetoed, they get their point back.<br/><br/>One group I did this with in March had not played any collaborative story telling games; they had only played RPGs like D&amp;D and Dead Lands.  They really liked being able to mess with the other PCs' and their stories and also with the NPCs and the GM's stories.<br/><br/>When we used Universalis in our earlier campaign, we did it at the start of each session and any time we would have otherwise had a cut scene.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270571/#Comment_270571" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T03:15:04+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  3:15AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give some more examples of these "vignettes", sounds interesting but not 100% sure what you are getting at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270576/#Comment_270576" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T04:32:49+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  4:32AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like something I did with the D&amp;D 4E campaign I just started.

If two people asked the same thing, <em>that's</em> the cool thing that everyone wants to hear more about, so you can spend two scenes on that. Play to focus on other people's fun instead of your own and all that. We're only one session in, but by all reports, it was a hell of a session. (I never trust my own judgment of how well a game went when I GM, it's just too different an experience.)<br/><br/>They've already learned that it's real easy to pace the reveals out too slowly, since they already made it to level 2 and only one of them got in a vignette. Once that sinks in, I think we'll have several big character reveals in every session. Which will be awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
