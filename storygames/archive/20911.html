They've played through Speed, Frozen, Halloween, Jaws, etc. Its amazing! But, I hate GURPS. Like with a passion. In my opinion its very much overcomplicated and it takes hours to create characters etc. <br/><br/>So what I wanted instead was a system that has more of a pick-up-and-play element to it. As an amateur game designer, I thought I'd give it a crack. I've been at it for a few days so I thought I'd bring it to you guys to get some feedback. It's a microsystem and it's missing some information but it seems to be a stable build. <br/><br/>I'd like in particular feedback of the reward cycles, simplicity or complexity, or anything else you can see getting in the way of fun. I've not yet run a playtest of it so it's up in the air. I wanna get as stable a build as possible before trying. This is intended to be released free of charge to the public when it's done. Anywho check it below:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0rQNwd22ivsZFdWUFRxeVl1QlU/edit?usp=docslist_api&amp;filetype=msword" rel="nofollow">Untitled Movie Game</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458843/#Comment_458843" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-28T04:15:42+00:00" title="December 28, 2016  4:15AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2016 4:20AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this game concept, makes sense to me. It could be fun to play something that uses a stable, pre-packaged scenario and treatment that everybody can study at once in a compact two-hour block (also called a "movie") as a starting point. The dramatic irony is palpable in replaying stories, and I've always liked it when I've done it.<br/><br/>Regarding the game you have here, though, I don't see the point - it's just a light-weight adventure game chassis to me, with simple character stat blocks and a task resolution system. There are dozens if not hundreds of games out there just like that - as far as I can see, it's up to minute preference whether one would use Pool or Wushu or Fudge or any other two-syllable game to do something similar.<br/><br/>The above point isn't particularly a dealbreaker for you, I think, as it doesn't make a game bad that there are similar games out there - it's just the external viewpoint that is influenced. For what it's worth, I've done this replay thing with e.g. <i>Dust Devils</i> (I've done Lord of the Rings and Sin City with it; friends have also done Pride and Prejudice - all to great success), which is one of those many games with broadly similar mechanical chassis, and it's worked quite well, so your game may as well, provided the correct GMing technique is used.<br/><br/>A second point, however, might matter more to you as well: I'm not sure if one couldn't be more thoroughly ambitious with the concept of replaying a movie. What you have here is <i>mostly</i> just a scenario-based adventure game, with a a thoroughly freeform plotting technique ("the GM should make sure that the content of the movie is used somehow, but don't be pushy about it", basically) and a mechanical nod to conformity in the form of plot points you get for sticking to the movie. For me this feels like a half-way conceptualization that focuses more on what is ordinary for roleplaying games ("my player character, good or bad", "I've got a stat block", "let's roll some dice", "the GM brings the story"), rather than bringing up a fresh perspective that relies actively on the movie all the way through. I can see how this would be the outcome when one takes a GURPS-based movie replay as a starting point, of course.<br/><br/>Were I personally creating a game from this premise, I'd try to think of how to integrate the premise in a more fundamental way than just statting up characters from the movie in a way that differs from GURPS only in its simplicity. For example, I'm seeing some a vague idea about some sort of an act structure and thematic breakdown that the players analyze out of the movie after seeing it - maybe they have a plot map of some sort from the movie, and they move through that as they play. I don't know if there would be a GM there, it's probable that something more like the ever-excellent <i>Microscope</i> would be the logical structure. Much of the game would be about <i>testing</i> the movie plotline, contesting the issue of whether these characters in these situations truly would come to these outcomes; there would be mechanical force, a certain kind of ironic gravity pulling the story towards the "true" plotline, with the freedom of the players in being true to the characters and action acting to strain this force like a rubber band. One of the big payoffs of playing through the game would be to see whether the movie "makes it" essentially intact, or whether that metaphorical rubber band snaps and the characters break to fulfill their destinies in some other way. The process of play would bring the players new insight about this movie: it's structure, themes and whether it is "true" in the sense of withstanding the merciless gaming of its premise, or if it breaks apart in the process.<br/><br/>(Oh, also, I would totally set up a campaign mode where you assign XP to the cast and crew that made the movie, depending on how the session went. Then next time you play you might pick another movie from the same director or something, and benefit from him "being experienced" from earlier sessions, which will then influence how the game goes. Just because I'm wacky like that.)<br/><br/>I hope that wasn't so negative as to ruin your day; I'm not trying to be mean, just calling it as I see it. Both of my points (it's conventional, and it doesn't go very far with the concept) are fundamentally matters of taste, and for all I know these are aspects of the game that you <i>like</i>, in which case it's all looking good; not very game needs to proge, it's cool to also design games where you just play some characters for a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458844/#Comment_458844" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-28T10:19:09+00:00" title="December 28, 2016 10:19AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be honest, probably most of the RPGs I play are at least movie/TV series inspired.<br/>Basically, any RPG that fits the setting and works as a system can be used.<br/><br/><i>Primetime Adventures</i> was designed specifically for playing TV series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja" title="Ferninja"><img alt="Ferninja" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/663/n5I0JAA0QAU5X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja">Ferninja</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458849/#Comment_458849" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-28T16:32:04+00:00" title="December 28, 2016  4:32PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I hope that wasn't so negative as to ruin your day; </blockquote>\nDude, not at all! Thank you so much for the input. I figured out how to take criticism a while ago. <br/><br/>Part of the main reason I brought it to you guys is because the game felt lame and lacking. I have a few darlings in there. I like the genre points to grant authorship, and the player roles. But the rest of this is open for molding. And I'm plenty willing to kill a darling if during playtesting I find out this isnt the kind of game I want to be making. <br/><br/>My problem with elaborating on different concepts and creating the plot track would be I was planning on this being a micro-system. I was wanting to keep this at four pages max. But I really like some of your ideas. <br/><br/>I liked the idea of assigning xp to the cast and crew. Maybe expand on that to encompass different actors. Like maybe if the players like playing as Chris Pratt and he has more xp, they can get different advantages. The plot track you mentioned is fantastic. Maybe I should expand on it and put a little more energy into it. Because you're right. I just wanted a vague system to manage players and resolution mechanics. But the plot track could be awesome, keeping the plot on course in an elastic way. <br/><br/>Ooh! And director selection could be fun! Like what if Home Alone was directed by Quentin Tarantino? Or Michael Bay directed Lawrence of Arabia? You've actually given me loads of food for thought. Thank you so much!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja" title="Ferninja"><img alt="Ferninja" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/663/n5I0JAA0QAU5X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja">Ferninja</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458851/#Comment_458851" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-28T17:21:09+00:00" title="December 28, 2016  5:21PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To be honest, probably most of the RPGs I play are at least movie/TV series inspired.<br/>Basically, any RPG that fits the setting and works as a system can be used.<br/><br/><i>Primetime Adventures</i> was designed specifically for playing TV series.</blockquote>\nOh I know theres tons out there, I agree!

What if you have to achieve certain budgets in order to recreate important scenes? (Failure would mean that, say, your Death Star is really lame and made of cardboard, which is embarassing.)<br/><br/>There could be a whole game in here, of "How much did our movie gross on opening weekend?" (Instead of XP, you compete for earnings or critics' ratings or Oscars or something.)<br/><br/>Or you could find a middle ground between 'the people behind the movie' and the movie itself. Perhaps you start with a certain plot, but then the "actors" compete to make their character the "hero" of the film. In the end, you might get a familiar movie, or you might get something totally unrecognizable (if, say, someone playing the Villain ends up overshadowing everyone else and being seen as the hero of that film. <br/><br/>Maybe it's Lord of the Rings, and we find out that Saruman was right after all, and Gandalf was a fool who almost destroyed Middle Earth with his wacky plans? Saruman steps in at the last minute to save the day...<br/><br/>If you're staying "within the movie", though, there's still plenty of room for maneuvering. I like the idea of separating "on-script" and "off-script" behaviour mechanically. Perhaps you use different mechanics or resources depending on which you do.<br/><br/>The film proceeds as a regular "adventure" (characters trying to overcome adversity), but you always have the choice of going off-script.<br/><br/>If and when you do, of course, it's VERY risky, but the possible rewards are greater. (And, of course, you might be forced by other failures to go off-script at some point.)<br/><br/>For example, if you choose the "scripted" option, your chances of success are high, and on a failure, the outcome isn't that terrible. But go off-script, and your chances are much lower, but if you succeed you can achieve things that never happened in the original film (bypassing the sacrifices and losses of the characters).<br/><br/>I imagine playing a scene where (we know!) the hero's beloved sidekick is about to get killed, sacrificing himself for the hero. I'm playing the hero. Do I follow the plot of the movie, allowing him to die, but preserving my chances of succeeding in the long run? Or do I break from the plot, so I can have a chance of saving him, but at the risk of losing the larger game?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458870/#Comment_458870" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-29T08:28:01+00:00" title="December 29, 2016  8:28AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2016 8:30AM by BeePeeGee.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;What if you have to achieve certain budgets in order to recreate important scenes? <br/>If you want to go in that direction. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19882/sceneplay-narrative-card-system-playtest-ap" rel="nofollow">AsIf's game ScenePlay</a> has mechanics that handle this pretty well imo.<br/><br/>Deliverator, you seem to have put quite a lot of work into ShowDown. I'll take a look.<br/><br/>Ferninja. Since most of my sessions are movie/TV inspired, this is has always been a quest for me to search for the "holy grail" for playing certain films. <i>What would you play Buffy with? Firefly? American Gods? Vampire Diaries? Highlander? Veronica Mars? Madoka Magica? Lost Room?</i> This is the angle I'm coming from.<br/><br/>So, for your <i>Untitled Movie RPG</i>, I'd propose picking &amp; focusing on a specific genre.<br/><br/>Essential parameters are for me:<br/>- Are the main characters more empowered in a maybe even pulpy setting? Or are the characters overwhelmed in a maybe more gritty setting?<br/>- Are handling relationships a central element?<br/>- Do I need mechanics to handle superpowers or magic?<br/>- Do I need genre specific elements?<br/><br/>These questions are essential for choosing the right RPG system for me. I'm a fan of <i>Urban Fantasy</i> and I've got a lot of mileage out of the <i>Dresden Files (Fate) RPG</i>, also a few PbtA games.<br/>Of course, if you'd play something like a "cabin in the woods" type of horror this would be totally unsuitable. You might be better off with i.e. <i>Final Girl</i>.<br/>In fact, I highly recommend <b>Final Girl</b> as good example of turning a specific movie genre into a tight small game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja" title="Ferninja"><img alt="Ferninja" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/663/n5I0JAA0QAU5X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja">Ferninja</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458879/#Comment_458879" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-29T17:01:43+00:00" title="December 29, 2016  5:01PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>You should actually start reading on page 32 of the doc, where it says Post-Metatopia 2014.

When I started re-writing the other day I added an "awards ceremony" at the end where everyone votes for everyone elses performance. Best Actor, best action sequence, scariest moment, etc. <br/><br/>These award points are fed from two pools that fill throughout play based on how accurate it was to the original film. The pools are Accuracy and Originality. I've yet to figure out a way to link the pools to the ceremony. <br/><br/>Also the XP is awarded to specific actors that the players attach to the characters. Such as if they want to see Michael Fasbender as John McClane instead of Bruce Willis, they can do that for a different set of acting skills. The Director is also a selectable feature. Like if you pick Quentin Tarantino to do your replay of Home Alone, all actors can get +1 to Violence Scenes and Pointless Dialogue Scenes. But Samuel Jackson HAS to be in the movie. lol                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
