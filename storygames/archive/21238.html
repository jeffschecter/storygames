The last thread was closed because it was slightly inflammatory. I'd like to avoid that here.<br/><br/>As a silent observer in the OSR community, I have learned a few general trends about the OSR playstyle and preferences.<br/><br/>1. The emphasis is on usable content. There's a swathe of usable content in the form of adventure modules and premade dungeons. All of those are usable content because the work is done for the GM in advance. Random tables fall into this category also: they're an easy way to generate new content and inspiration for new content. It's all usable in the game.<br/><br/>2. Following from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, rules that are fiddly, overly-complicated, and/or can't be summarized into one or two dice rolls, it probably doesn't belong at the game table. Anything that needlessly bogs down the game is a net negative because it detracts from playing the game. This is exemplified in the saving throw system: saving throws are a binary yes/no. Does the poison kill you? Yes: roll up a new character. No: might want to run. Adding in more granularity has its benefits, but it slows down game.<br/><br/>3. The dungeon just works. It provides a pretext for exploring the unknown. It's dangerous. It's strange. It offers puzzles, decision points, risk/reward management, and roleplaying opportunities. It doesn't have to make sense, so it can be as weird and exotic as you like. It is a game within the game.<br/><br/>4. It's Conan, not Lord of the Rings. Lethality is a feature, not a bug. Avarice and cunning are rewarded. Heroics are not. Gold-to-XP reinforces this. You get the gold, you level up. You charge into combat, and you die.<br/><br/>5. Resource management is important. It's the game.<br/><br/>What are some ways that this can be altered, innovated, or streamlined? For me, the number one issue is tracking time. I find meticulously tracking the ticking clock to be a pain in the ass. I much prefer abstract time. Not quite "encounters" or "scenes," but something in between pure abstraction and down-to-the-second beancounting.<br/><br/>I divide the game into chunks depending on the time scale we're working on. In the dungeon, time is essential because it influences your torchlight, your food/water, wandering monsters, etc. Every time the players do something that will take some time - this is largely determined by DM fiat and negotiating the fiction - I make a tick mark. That represents about ten minutes or so, making it easy to match to spell durations and resources.<br/><br/>Six ticks in an hour. Your torch lasts six ticks. Better get movin'. (Note: Torchbearer's system of "turns" is far too punitive for my tastes.)<br/><br/>I'd be interesting in hearing others' thoughts, especially <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> (our resident D&amp;D experts).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465324/#Comment_465324" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T17:22:29+00:00" title="August  4, 2017  5:22PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I divide the game into chunks depending on the time scale we're working on.

Random encounters every n turns (n depends on the dungeon), torches burn for k turns, other light sources some probably different number of turns. A turn is 10 minutes.<br/><br/>An interesting variant is for the referee to roll random encounter checks whenever nothing is happening or they are bored. Players are discussing something and possibly facing analysis-paralysis? Nothing is happening, so make a random encounter check. The characters are also staying in the same place for a long time and making noise, so the check is justified from the point of view of fiction, also. Players are searching for secret doors a lot? Boring, make a random encounter check. It also takes plenty of time in the fiction, which justifies the check.<br/>Nothing is happening and referee boredness are both reasonable indicators of random encounter checks being called for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465327/#Comment_465327" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T22:58:43+00:00" title="August  4, 2017 10:58PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen distance (measured in hexes traversed) used as a proxy for time to good effect.

The rules have, since the first edition of the game, called the fictional 10-minute increment a "turn" - I like the full name "exploration turn" myself because it's less ambivalent. It's one of the solidly formalist, functional and universal basics of D&amp;D. It's about as foundational to the game's approach to exploration mechanics as the hit point system is for combat.<br/><br/>The original '74 rules have a lot of good stuff in them, and while people seem to disagree a bit about what the good parts are, for me personally the exploration rules are it: those are the structural core. When the text is telling me about the exploration turns and enforced rest periods (every hour, or once in six turns, needs to be spent resting) and all that stuff, that's where I recognize actual game design instead of just random mechanical outpour of an unnamed process (which is, honestly, a big part of the books).<br/><br/>More generally, you probably know what I think is the interesting bit about old school D&amp;D mechanics - the constitutional refereeing method for developing rulings. The actual rules, those are just the cruft; one reason for why I haven't written out and published my own houserules as a game text is that it's the exact sort of thing that's been misleading the eye ever since TSR originally decided to approach this D&amp;D thing by writing down the rules instead of the rulings process.<br/><br/>There is nothing <i>really</i> special about the D&amp;D rules mechanics, not any more than say twenty or so other RPGs that feature unique mechanical innovations pushed to their limits. Sure, the hit point system is gold for its purpose, but so are dice pools and scene framing and learn-by-doing experience simulators; there are many games with that level of innovation and dinstictiveness. The real thing that makes D&amp;D special as a rpg to me is that it's a refereed wargame with rulings instead of rules. There are not many other wargames in roleplaying, if we understand the term to mean a challengeful game with a genuine commitment to how things really work. I know of no other rulings-based game (and arguably rulings-based refereeing has been a minority interpretation of the game since almost the beginning - players have always wanted TSR to be the big daddy and provide official rules). We're talking of some rare, unique stuff here.<br/><br/>I realize that others disagree, but for me the issues like unified vs. organic mechanics, or using dice to resolve traps and social situations, those are noise compared to the core system of rulings-based refereeing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465332/#Comment_465332" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-05T01:37:50+00:00" title="August  5, 2017  1:37AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            VSK, I can't remember if you're familiar with The Black Hack.

The things it asks you to perform matter, and cannot be replaced with arbitrary OOC challenges.<br/><br/>To be specific, the reason why I care about D&amp;D's subject matter is that warcraft in the wide sense of the word is an elevating discipline, and playing D&amp;D in a hardcore way is basically an exercise for the skills of strategy, tactics, historical knowledge and logistics. It's the same reason I care about e.g. the scouting hobby: learning these skills makes you a better person in a general way.<br/><br/>That said, I obviously agree about the fundamental point: D&amp;D is most true when it challenges the player, rather than being a theatrical exercise in pretending to be challenged (which is something that later-ages D&amp;D well knows).

(Having the DM determine the consequences without recourse to tools would be possible, and it is done occasionally, but in general it's an unhygienic method prone to bias.)<br/><br/>Massive amounts of attention are slathered upon the issue of how much arbitrariness is best, of course, and how much circumstantial factors should determine various situations; most of the old-school D&amp;D mechanical innovation is about getting the best possible wargaming sim out of as little mechanical overhead as possible - the game's so expansive (and has a bottleneck in the form of the DM) that the individual parts need to be light-weight and powerful for it to remain playable.<br/><br/>This role that the dice have is precisely why it's usually possible to bypass dice rolls in this type of D&amp;D, and why it favours some rather... strange rolls compared to many other types of rpgs. It all arises organically out of an effort to simulate the events in the fiction. For example, consider these situations from real play:<br/><b>*</b> The adventurers are facing a horde of 20 skeletons in a narrow hallway. They "finesse" the encounter by describing in detail a tactical arrangement that utilizes the established qualities of the skeletons (mindless, light-weight) and their prepared equipment (portable mantlets, boar spears, plenty of men) and environment (narrow hallway, lack of time pressure). The referee determines that there is no credible threat present, and the entire situation is resolved without a single dice roll.<br/><b>*</b> The adventurers surprise a villain in his lair. Lacking any better idea, the referee decides to roll a 50/50 check to see whether the villain is home. Totally arbitrary.<br/><b>*</b> The referee knows that there be trolls in these here woods. He rolls a 1/6 every hour spent in the woods to see if the trolls might stumble on the adventurers there. He ends up rolling about a dozen times during the session, and never rolls a '1'.<br/><b>*</b> An adventurer is falling into a deep crevasse. He happens to have a large net wrapped loosely around him, and the player argues that it just might be possible for the net to catch onto something early in the fall. As all other possibilities (character skill, outside interference, etc.) have already been exhausted, the referee allows a 1/20 miracle check to see if the adventurer is really, really lucky. He isn't.<br/><br/>Those kinds of mechanization choices are not normal for most kinds of roleplaying games: you don't usually waste time establishing and rolling for minutiae with low odds, you don't determine important events with arbitrary rolls, and you don't allow players to skip rolling for important events. These practices only make sense in D&amp;D because its creative agenda is so wargamey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465367/#Comment_465367" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T09:51:45+00:00" title="August  8, 2017  9:51AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2017 10:00AM by Rickard.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The dice rolls are there to simulate real-life uncertainties, of course. /.../  (Having the DM determine the consequences without recourse to tools would be possible, and it is done occasionally, but in general it's an unhygienic method prone to bias.)</p></div></blockquote>\nI would say that deciding the dice roll <i>is</i> biased in the first place.

I don't see much going on in that counter-argument aside from an utopian fallacy, though: you're basically saying that D&amp;D can't be genuinely about player skill because it doesn't have enough skill in the right places to satisfy your personal requirements. One could just as well say that in this imperfect world D&amp;D does what it can to be the best wargame it can be. It's not like the table isn't open for anybody to improve upon the particulars, if you can.<br/><br/>From my perspective the dicing in properly conducted old-school D&amp;D generally does a good job of:<br/>maintaining uncertainty of consequences,<br/>abstracting out irrelevancies and<br/>maintaining GM hygiene when determining imponderables.<br/>The consequence is that it's a game that focuses well in strategic and tactical decision-making, which is where the "player skill" in the game is involved. For example, in D&amp;D players have to choose whether to fight or flee, and the dice work well to provide quick, emergent consequences for either choice.<br/><br/>One might say that the most common core choice in D&amp;D is whether your adventurer should continue fighting for one more round, or whether they should retreat at this point. A lot of the tactical decision-making in the game returns to this single question and its many variations. It is an evergreen question in the game due to the always-mutating circumstances surrounding the to-hit roll: the respective hit points of the combatants, the hit bonuses vs. armor classes, the objectives of the battle, who gets to hit first, how feasible the retreat is, and so on.<br/><br/>I think that anybody advocating for a diceless D&amp;D would need to show how the decision-making would be affected without attack rolls (for both monsters and adventurers), and what would replace the uncertainty of the to-hit roll. Should the GM just decide who hits during the next round, and should the players, instead of gauging the odds, be gauging the GM? How would that work, exactly, and would it be a more elevated form of wargaming skill?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I would say that deciding the dice roll <i>is</i> biased in the first place.

This is usually the case for common issues that are central to the thematic landscape of the game, such as combat. The formal framework simplifies situations that would otherwise be too cumbersome to simulate in detail.<br/><b>*</b> The tested idea is "unlikely" or "far-fetched", in which case the target number is usually 1/6, or 15%. It's proven to be suitable odds for this sort of game with organically emergent possibilities, because it's not too common, and you can thus roll for all sorts of possibilities as they occur to you during the course of play. 1/6 is often substantially more likely than the fictional premise would "really" justify, but that's a known and intentional feature as well: D&amp;D generally wants to bias itself somewhat towards active events, but not so much that the players can count on this as part of their strategic formulations. 1/6 is a sweet spot in this regard, as it's too rare for anybody to count on it in a mission-critical context, but still common enough that it generally occurs a few times in each session of play.<br/><b>*</b> The tested idea is "imponderable" or "arbitrary", meaning that the referee and the group don't really have the means or the patience to work it out in detail right then and there; it is intuitively justifiable for it to go either way. The odds are 3/6 (or 50/50 as we tend to call it).<br/><b>*</b> Either of the above two categories of odds (1/6 and 3/6) is routinely adjusted by a step to either direction as the result of table negotiation in establishing the appropriate odds for the precise situation and circumstances. For example, 2/6 is generally used when 1/6 seems intuitively too harshly unlikely, or when the situation is clearly more biased than 3/6 would suggest. 4/6 and 5/6 are, of course, simply the opposites of these scenarios. When 1/6 seems too likely many GMs simply rule the odds "impossible", but I personally like to jump to a 1/20 in those cases (players are happier when they get that chance, no matter how slim); as with many things in the game, it depends on the GM's technique.<br/><br/>As can be seen, I don't think that the way you choose the timing and odds for the dice rolls is arbitrary at all. It's an earnest attempt at fair refereeing, letting events unfold consistently with the rules and campaign setting. The GM goes to the dice to avoid bias in decision-making, to preserve uncertainty of consequences and to abstract elegantly out of the need to simulate complex, yet secondary systems.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465369/#Comment_465369" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T13:02:00+00:00" title="August  8, 2017  1:02PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If D&amp;D is most true when challenging the player, then why the dice rolls?

There is always a degree of uncertainty in things and the die roll helps model that. You can plan all day for something and it can still go wrong. That doesn't mean the universe will screw you no matter how well you plan. It means some of them time, despite good planning, things go wrong.

Your ability to roll well on a d20 isn't what is being tested. Your ability to gauge the threat and take a chance doing something that triggers a roll like that is what is being tested. The GM is describing the environment around you, based on that you are assessing the levels of risk and deciding how to act. Provided the players have some sense of what their character's capabilities and the kinds of rolls that are likely to come up, even a situation where you are rolling dice involves skill because you are weighing the risks. When people talk about the player rather than the character being challenged, they don't mean that John showed up at the table to have his real world archery skills tested. It is a table top game with character who can do things the players can't. Mainly people are talking about things like problem solving skills, the ability to assess the situation and pick the best course of action, the ability to persuade NPCs to your advantage, etc. <br/><br/>I genuinely don't see why you think rolling would indicate GM railroading an outcome.

Player skill vs. character skill is embedded within the OSR by design. Once you've resorted to the dice, you're falling back on character skill, more or less, and OSR-style games model this with certain mechanics.<br/><br/>Why? Because the founders of the hobby were playing a game rooted in wargames. Those wargames had attack throws. You may as well inquire why saving throws were grouped by category over the more cogent design of Fortitude/Reflex/Will - because that is how it was done.<br/><br/>Specifically addressing some of <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard%27s">@Rickard's</a> inquiries, a good portion of player skill is navigating the fiction and, in some cases, playing co-DM. As always, the actual DM is the final arbiter of a situation, but this co-DMing takes place in the form of asking (leading) questions and making suggestions. <br/><br/>"There has to be a free stool that I can grab and use as an improvised weapon, right?"<br/><br/>"You mentioned that this cavern had glowbugs. I would like to capture some in a jar and use it as a makeshift torch."<br/><br/>"Given that trolls live in close proximity to the town, does it seem fair we would have heard talk of their vulnerabilities or tactics?"<br/><br/>The role of the DM is then to feed information back into this situation, taking the player prompts and weaving it into the fiction. In greater detail, I will attempt to address a few questions:\n<blockquote>I would say that deciding the dice roll is biased in the first place. Why should they roll at any specific moment? </blockquote>\nOne might interpret this as "adversarial GMing," but the majority of OSR has moved away from this style of gameplay. You'll notice some texts talk about the GM in terms of "Judge" and "Referee," which (correctly) carries the connotation of fairness and impartiality. When the GM turns to the dice for an answer, he is saying, "This thing could happen, but it also could not." What fairer way than to leave this to chance? The dice are unbiased. As you note, calling for a dice roll itself is a form of bias, but it is a reduction in overall bias. <br/><br/>The dice are a limit on the GM's authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465375/#Comment_465375" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T19:06:51+00:00" title="August  8, 2017  7:06PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2017 7:11PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Rickard has a fair point here ("outgoing" randomness is much more difficult to handle "hygienically", and does, in many respects reduce the impact of player skill), but I haven't yet seen a good application of this concept in practice.<br/><br/>Non-random designs and systems are often "solvable" (which is usually undesirable in this kind of gaming) and/or too complex. (For instance, we could represent each combat as a Chess game played against a Chess AI of the appropriate difficulty level, with the weaker side starting with fewer pieces, proportionately to its armaments and weight class... but it would detract too much from the game, no matter how interesting or fair that setup might seem to a given group of players.)<br/><br/>D&amp;D's everpresent "random rolls", in my opinion, have three functions:<br/><br/>1. To give the GM a way to make quick judgement calls without bearing the entire burden of decision-making or stalling a game altogether. For example, the "wandering monster" abstraction does a great job of simplifying the GM's ability and/or need to figure out where any given monsters are at any given time. It's a simplification which makes her job much easier.<br/><br/>Instead of tracking the current position of every monster in the dungeon, the GM only has to have a method for determining when to make a "wandering monster check", and the players thereby know how to interact with that and make their own relevant choices.<br/><br/>2. It is much, much easier for humans to agree on a probability of something happening or being the case than to agree on a definite outcome. This helps with social coherence at the table: we might argue all day long about whether the vampire is at home in his lair, but if we're given the option to settle on the *odds* of it being home, we're far more likely to reach agreement quickly. <br/><br/>That makes it easier to settle on rulings in the heat of play (a key feature of the "GM as Referee" mindset).<br/><br/>3. A general aesthetic desire for randomness, excitement, and unpredictability.<br/><br/>The OSR aesthetic delights in that final point - I think the high variability and randomness present in play, from character creation to the outcome of fights and random magical effects, is a key element of the "OSR magic", and has become traditional. <br/><br/>I think you could definitely create a functional "challenge-based adventuring dungeon crawl" game without that aesthetic (does Torchbearer fit the bill, perhaps?), but it would feel distinctly different.<br/><br/>I also think <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> is quite right in that a lot more innovation might take place in the OSR world if people were more willing to experiment with new designs and shake off traditions.

We are talking about rolling dice. You can call it 'outgoing randomness' all you want, that doesn't make the point any more or less true. A die roll is a randomizer and asking "should I cross this chasm and trigger a random roll based on the GM's description of said chasm" involves skill. You need the random element for the risk assessment judgment in the first place. It isn't reducing player skill, it is making player skill more relevant.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465379/#Comment_465379" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T19:27:01+00:00" title="August  8, 2017  7:27PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno! It's not jargon I'm aware of - I thought Rickard's description in his post was sufficient: what he's calling "outgoing" is deciding on what roll to make, when, and what its odds are *after* the players have made all the relevant decisions.<br/><br/>It's clearly a very different process from playing within a known system and gauging risk adequately. <br/><br/>In my experience, successful play in this style relies on techniques to mitigate this issue:<br/><br/>* Consistent rulings based on precedent - the knowledge that we handle fictional situations consistently allows players to make better "bets" on how future situations will be resolved.<br/><br/>* Relying on overt materials for consensus, like pre-written modules, standards (e.g. Hit Dice for monsters, and how they relate to ThAC0 or saving throws), and public random tables.<br/><br/>* Clear communication within the group, including various tools to telegraph the difficulty of rolls before they are made ("Hey, before I get into a fight with this thing, is dealing with poisoning in this game a Con check, a saving throw, or does poison whittle down your hit points?"). As another example, consider the common assumption/tradition that dungeons get more dangerous as you go to lower levels - it's a technique that helps the players gauge the risks involved before those situations come up.<br/><br/>* Various rules of thumb in terms of how rolls are called for and what is or isn't binding. For example, in many groups it's considered normal for a player to be allowed to "retract" a stated action if they didn't know the difficulty numbers or dice odds involved when they chose that action. ("Oh, I have to make two Dex checks just to get across? Hang on, I'll do something else instead...")<br/><br/>Groups which aren't good at that kind of thing don't tend to do too well.<br/><br/>That said, I totally agree that just having dice in play and rolling for this kind of thing in practice doesn't destroy player choice or fair challenge or anything of the sort - in fact, it's the best way to do this that I'm currently aware of.<br/><br/>It's kind of like democracy or capitalism: it works.<br/><br/>Where I agree with Rickard is that it is, indeed, a compromise. It would be fun to see some new and different traditions of "challenge-based" play evolve and potentially compete with this model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465384/#Comment_465384" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T22:18:44+00:00" title="August  8, 2017 10:18PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah the central thing is that players really do know what they are rolling against.

But in most instances the players are going to have some sense of their chances. They will at least know what their attributes are for example. Without knowing the specific scenario in mind it is a bit hard to get into specifics. But Rickard's claim that dice remove player skill only makes sense if every action is determined entirely by a coin toss or something. But that isn't how D&amp;D works. There is both skill involved in gauging your approximate chances of success and in assessing whether a given situation is likely to result dangers requiring random rolls in the first place. It is almost never a total crap shoot. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465388/#Comment_465388" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T00:40:49+00:00" title="August  9, 2017 12:40AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I dunno!

You have to pay attention throughout the game, as losing out on a few points in the first few turns can mean the difference between winning and losing many turns later. It is a game that rewards some planning, though owing to the variability of combat, you also have to react to surprises from the dice as well as from the players.<br/><br/>In chess you can survive going down a pawn early in the game, but if you really screw up and go down a rook or queen, you've had it. Similarly in Britannia, if you make a big error--say, as the Welsh, fighting the Romans to the death instead of submitting--then you can't win the game, and face hours having to deal with that.<br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The presence of chance, variability, in the combat, takes Britannia away from the chess analogy, thank heaven. (For me, chess is "too much like work".) Whether there's "too much luck" is a matter for disagreement. In my online survey, about 75% of players think the amount of luck is OK, and most of the rest think there should be less. In my prototypes I generally have adopted methods with less chance, some of them diceless though not deterministic. I hardly ever consider using the original combat method in new games. (Then again, I was known to say 30-some years ago "I hate dice games", but then I came onto D&amp;D and designed Britannia and other games that use dice...)<br/><br/>I think expert Brit players would say that bad luck can be managed, as long as there isn't a really long run of bad luck. Less expert players often think the game can revolve around a few rolls. To my mind, most rolls in Britannia are not important out of proportion, unless someone is desperately trying to kill a rival king in the endgame. Dice can be managed in Brit just as they can be managed in D&amp;D. "What?" Yes, in (first edition) D&amp;D you can try to minimize the number of times you MUST get lucky. This is the same as how you ought to manage life, trying to avoid times when you MUST get lucky. So smart people wear seatbelts, some people don't. Smart people exercise, some people don't. Smart people don't smoke, some people do. And so forth.</blockquote>\nWhat he gets from D&amp;D is the idea that each die roll is exciting for its unpredictability, but that the game is built on rolling so many dice that it becomes predictable at a large scale. This is part of the war-gaming element I know Eero talks about on here too, an important one. And it's how skill works in this tradition.<br/><br/>I think Pulsipher's model is informative even if it's stuck in his particular moment\u2014he talks specifically about how different versions of D&amp;D approach this differently further down the thread (and he's a grognard writing about 4e in 2008, so he's wrong lol). In any case it's part of a wargaming tradition that explicitly identifies this randomness as a sign of a skill-based game, a totally opposite read to Rickard's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465392/#Comment_465392" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T07:46:12+00:00" title="August  9, 2017  7:46AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2017 8:10AM by Rickard.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/adamwb">@adamwb</a>: Yeah, but Pulsipher is talking about probability in a sense that people say that poker is skill based.

I just protested against the idea that a game, that has that much output randomness (outgoing randomness), has player skill close to it's heart, especially for a game that rejects at least 3/6 of the players' ideas whenever dice rolls are involved.<br/><br/>But it's a good question you bring up, and a question I would hope that you would ask. That said, I have nothing about input randomness (ingoing randomness). It's like be given a hand of cards in <b>Once Upon a Time</b> or <b>Magic the Gathering</b> (or <b>Tetris</b>!) and do the best with that. <a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee%27s">@BeePeeGee's</a> thoughts about Performative Contingency (Jenga tower, pushups) can be a nice topic in a new thread in how to replace dice roll with other kinds of uncertainties?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The target numbers in old-school D&amp;D are generally based on the following four ideas: /.../ As can be seen, I don't think that the way you choose the timing and odds for the dice rolls is arbitrary at all.

The last one is a hidden difficulty level that not many people think of. The difference in doing three dice rolls for one complex action or only one is pretty large.<br/><br/>And I assume this behavior will occur, even for a good game master. So rolls are "biased"?

Not because it's an insurmountable obstacle that would have factually prevented successful play in the game in the past, but rather because it's so much on the forefront of minds and hearts and play procedure all the time: the game only works <i>because</i> referee bias is being constantly addressed in different ways.<br/><br/>I think it would be entirely fair to say that the biggest single reason for the game having established rules procedures for certain things (combat, saves, dying, spell-casting, etc.) is that it does a lot to maintain a refereeing environment where the GM is practically accountable - that is, there really is something concrete and established in the refereeing process for the players to check and gauge, and thus keep the GM honest. There is no particular reason why the goals of D&amp;D couldn't be achieved with the GM simply assigning off-the-cuff percentages for everything as they go, except for the need for accountability and consistency, both of which are helped by the existence of acknowledged rules procedures.<br/><br/>This feature of the game has often been characterized in Internet discussions with extremist positions that obscure what seems to be really going on: both the "D&amp;D can't work because it's impossible to be impartial and the players are deluding themselves" and the opposite "it's the GM's game and he's got the viking hat and if you don't like it you don't have to play" positions ignore how much trust-building, hygienic practice and accountability goes into refereeing old school D&amp;D.<br/><br/>(To clarify, I didn't write this as a particular response to Rickard or anybody else - just expanding on the thread topic.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465398/#Comment_465398" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T11:48:03+00:00" title="August  9, 2017 11:48AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2017 12:55PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" rel="nofollow">Bedrockbrendan</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And the only place I find it on a google search is some essay where a guy tries to argue that a game like Risk is shallow (and basically bad) because it uses random rolls to resolve conquest.

I googled on "game theory outgoing randomness" and found these two links pretty quickly:<br/><br/><a href="http://keithburgun.net/randomness-and-game-design/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://keithburgun.net/randomness-and-game-design/</a><br/><br/><a href="https://oakleafgames.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/game-theory-types-of-randomness/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://oakleafgames.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/game-theory-types-of-randomness/</a><br/><br/>I got the term from Keith Burgun, who writes a lot about strategic games and decision-making. That first link talks about output randomness and player skill. And I fully agree with his article, since I (when I was 20) realized that all that came down to <b>Blood Bowl</b> was rolling a d6 to see who won, if the opponent was as good as you. Player skill was capped because of the dice rolling. (Actually, Blood Bowl reminds me of snooker or pool, because the game is about limiting your opponents possibilities but that's another story.)<br/><br/>Another article - a lengthy one - and not that critic against player skill vs randomness (by the author of <b>Star Wars d6</b> and <b>Paranoia</b>) that is worth contemplating:<br/><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/GregCostikyan/20091113/85910/Randomness_Blight_or_Bane.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/GregCostikyan/20091113/85910/Randomness_Blight_or_Bane.php</a></div></blockquote>\nI never suggested google search skills had anything to do with arguments. I was just pointing out you are using jargon to help buffer an argument, and the jargon seems to come from an obscure article. The Keith Burgun article is the one I was referring to finding. Again, I think the argument in the essay is pretty bad. And in that article he argues Risk is shallow because it uses dice to resolve conquest. In fact here is an example of that sort of gem from the article:\n<blockquote><b>Some games need output randomness to work (Counter argument).</b><br/><br/>If you were to just rip the dice rolls out of Risk, it definitely wouldn\u2019t work.<br/><br/>This simply means that they are shallow games. It\u2019s understandable, because creating a coherent system that is deep is very, very hard to do. However, this is not a defense of randomness; more an indication of a weak design.</blockquote>\nThe reason you know the article is bunk is because if it's conclusions were followed a lot of very good games like Risk would not exist (or at least games like them wouldn't continue to be made. He isn't simply arguing that there should be more chess-like board games, or that people should weigh randomness before using it. He is saying this type of randomness is always bad design, always uninteresting and never connected to player skill. Just because he uses Jargon, that doesn't mean what he says is automatically more true. It is sophistry.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465410/#Comment_465410" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T17:51:59+00:00" title="August  9, 2017  5:51PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>All this is, however, not applicable on these kind of roleplaying game situations.</p></div></blockquote>\nwhy not?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465420/#Comment_465420" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T23:11:24+00:00" title="August  9, 2017 11:11PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that the article in question makes some good points, but then jumps to a rather general conclusion without considering details.<br/><br/>For instance, I absolutely agree that uncertain, random procedures used in an OSR-style "dungeon crawl" reduce the role of player skill in the game.

(See e.g. Julian Gollop's Chaos, or Telepath Tactics.) In a game like that, the deterministic move is the safe move, and the randomized-results-dependent move is an optional gambit. There, if the player chooses the non-deterministic move and it fails, I think it's reaching a bit to call it unfair--the player had the option of a deterministic move, but freely chose non-determinism in the hope of an added reward. The player does not need an opportunity to react to a failed gambit in order to render the results fair.<br/><br/>As long as everything is built atop a deterministic skeleton, and non-deterministic moves are limited enough that the player has a full range of tactical options without being forced to resort to non-deterministic abilities, I'd argue that many of the disadvantages of non-determinism become fairly negligible.</blockquote>\nI'd say that describes many of the activities D&amp;D players engage in pretty well. (Especially with a group which communicates well and is good at using the "precedent" of earlier rulings to inform future rulings.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465423/#Comment_465423" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T23:43:49+00:00" title="August  9, 2017 11:43PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2017 11:44PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It seems to me that the article in question makes some good points, but then jumps to a rather general conclusion without considering details.<br/><br/>For instance, I absolutely agree that uncertain, random procedures used in an OSR-style "dungeon crawl" reduce the role of player skill in the game.

If every action in D&amp;D were handed over to a coin toss, that might make sense. But the random rolls reflect things in the game world. Again without knowing what specific situation, OSR game and mechanic people have in mind it is a bit hard to address. But if I make a first level mage for the very basics of the game are minimally explained, then I can pretty easily gather it isn't a good idea for my mage to attack a large creature with a dagger. And so much of the skillful stuff has to do with the interactions between the rolls. If I am playing that mage, you can bet I am being more cautious and playing my character smart so he doesn't bite it in the first hour. When people talk about player skill, they are not talking about the player's skill at mastering a system or working through the logic of a gaming procedure, they are talking about their skill of navigating the world the dice help emulate.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465426/#Comment_465426" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T00:39:02+00:00" title="August 10, 2017 12:39AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan,<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure why you quoted me at length in your last post - seems to we are entirely in agreement on this point. In fact, I wrote those last two posts precisely to say the same thing you are now saying, it seems to me: Burgun is overlooking the context of the rolls being made, including the deterministic options available to the players. That's a big part of what makes the game work, and takes out of the realm of the entirely random into a skill-based endeavour.<br/><br/>That said, I think your thought experiment here illustrates the dilemma very well:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" rel="nofollow">Bedrockbrendan</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If every action in D&amp;D were handed over to a coin toss, that might make sense.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is the logical extreme position to take: for example, in a "simplified" D&amp;D where everyone has the same hit points, armor class, and "to hit bonus" (or ThAC0), a combat becomes arguably much more based on luck, with fewer ways for the players to affect outcomes. Imagining this hypothetical game, we can see what a heavy role luck plays in the process of play.<br/><br/>Now, if we add character differentiation (like armor class, to hit bonuses, and so forth), and then assign modifiers in play (perhaps for cover, fatigue, encumbrance, etc), we are making each resolution point less random - less like a "coin toss" - and creating an interesting and asymmetrical playground. The more we do this, the less "random" resolution becomes. <br/><br/>In a theoretical world, a D&amp;D-like game could have so many minute little modifiers added on to its basic resolution mechanics that we no longer need to roll - we just add up the modifiers until success or failure is certain. ("Ok, I have +6 to hit, he's off-balance, reducing his armor bonus, and I've aimed for 3 seconds for another +4... all I have to do is step out of line-of-sight for an additional +5, which means any roll would be an automatic success. I've established my positioning for a +12 to 'maneuver', which means I can step out of line-of-sight automatically... so I hit!") <br/><br/>That game would no longer have any randomness at all.<br/><br/>Notably, though:<br/><br/>1. Many D&amp;D tables (especially various versions of really old D&amp;D) come surprisingly close to "every action handed over to a coin toss". In old-school D&amp;D with few modifiers (for instance, early D&amp;D before stat modifiers), every starting character has the exact same odds of a "to hit" roll, for example, and may have exactly the same odds for attempting a variety of other important tasks (usually a 1-in-6 chance).<br/><br/>Combine this with the way a DM may choose to adjudicate actions, and I've seen some D&amp;D play where most rolls have almost exactly the same odds of success. (e.g. A game where Ability Checks are used for most actions, and the starting characters all have stats in the 9-12 range, and the same ThAC0.)<br/><br/>It's not an entirely uncommon practice, in my experience with D&amp;D players. (I've also seen some people simplify combat by announcing to the players that "a 14 or higher hits!", ignoring "to hit" bonuses and armor class, for instance, or giving all starting characters the same saving throw numbers.)<br/><br/>2. <i>Even in those games</i>, D&amp;D can remain a game of player skill. The more the game heads towards "coin toss resolution", the more players have to become really good at communicating risk and reward - if you're truly playing in a 'deadly, OSR style', the game becomes very much about avoiding rolling in the first place.<br/><br/>The communication and negotiation of the fiction can be very strong here, and if the players are skilled at using that to create meaningful choices, the strategy involved in figuring out how to maneuver into positions where you make the fewest rolls, or roll at times when the risk is minimized for you, becomes the real game.<br/><br/>That can be a really fun and challenging way to play.<br/><br/>There's a wide, wide continuum at work here, but I firmly believe that the "true game" of old-school style D&amp;D is about negotiating fictional challenges, which can happen at any point on that spectrum (just in slightly different ways). Which point any given player or group prefers is probably just a matter of taste, so long as their underlying methods of communicating with each other and negotiating fictional challenges are strong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465427/#Comment_465427" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T00:40:22+00:00" title="August 10, 2017 12:40AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (By the way, I'd be happy to provide some examples if you still feel we're on different sides of some kind of argument, since that goes well beyond dicing odds.

Falling damage, save vs. die poisons and petrification attacks, starting out with 5 hit points--all of these establish that if you do engage the mechanics, you're in very dangerous territory.<br/><br/>I see the randomness as a way for the GM to disclaiming responsibility in situations that are possibly lethal, but where a design decision has been made not to have the players coming up with clever schemes.<br/><br/>For example, creating a wooden structure to artificially narrow a cave mouth so that only one kobold at a time can get out is relegated to the fruitful void - this play style embraces player-GM conversations about this sort of thing. It doesn't embrace clever descriptions of the particular way you slash at the lead kobold (in an otherwise straight duel) as a way of gaining advantage.<br/><br/>You could certainly write a freeform swordfighting game where the challenge is to convince the GM of the effectiveness of your stance and fighting technique, and its utility in dealing with kobold spear techniques, but this just isn't that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465468/#Comment_465468" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T19:06:46+00:00" title="August 10, 2017  7:06PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This whole "skill vs. dice" thing is silly.
