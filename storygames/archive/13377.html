(veritascitor) as the MC.<br/><br/>I'm impressed.<br/><br/>I'm playing my first genderqueer character on the player side, an Angel named Kine.  Kine's about 20, and hot in a way that many people find hard to ignore.  <br/><br/>Ohm is a hardhold set up around a hydro dam, presumably somewhere like Colorado or maybe Arizona.  We have a lot of problems; the old Doctor, named Abe, was killed by our hardholder's enemies.   He was Kine's mentor and she worked the infirmary with Shig and Mox, who Kine has sort of inherited.<br/><br/>I'll post some other time about the other PCs, but one thing I learned the hard way in the first session: When you make a mistake, it's bad.  When you miss, it's bad.  When you make a mistake AND you miss, it's really, really bad.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301430/#Comment_301430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T08:29:35+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  8:29AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for starting this thread, Ry. I'll try to take the notes I have and compile them here, and any thoughts and/or questions I have about the system. <br/><br/>I think I did an okay job with the first session, considering I'm working just from the book and what I've read on forums. I wish I had the chance to play the game first, with an experienced MC, but instead I'm diving in headfirst.<br/><br/>Random thoughts:<br/><br/>I had lots of making stuff up on the fly, springing off character creation, asking a few questions (but not necessarily enough), pushing the characters where they weren't in control (but, again, not necessarily enough). <br/>A lot of my moves ended up being about announcing future badness, setting up the world, but a few of the missed rolls allowed for me to make moves that set off very important chains of events.<br/>I may have made the three characters' threads a little too separate to begin with, but ended up pointing them all in the same direction come the end of the session.<br/>I also ended up with a dozen or so named NPCs that we saw onscreen, and a few named NPCs that we haven't seen yet, with a few PC-NPC-PC triangles. The sheer amount of ideas and characters that we came up with really surprised me.<br/><br/>More details/thoughts/questions to come later this weekend, when I have the time to go over my notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301449/#Comment_301449" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T10:27:26+00:00" title="November 19, 2010 10:27AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John layed down some notes on <a href="http://outsidetheredbox.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/apocalypse-world-actual-play" rel="nofollow">his blog</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301461/#Comment_301461" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T13:58:32+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  1:58PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, sounds cool!<br/><br/>John's writeup is excellent.<br/><br/>I miss you dudes!

Kine started working for his mentor, Abe, after his chopper ex-boyfriend, Ruth, dumped him as they were passing through Ohm. Abe was recently killed in a raid from a nearby 'hold, leaving Kine to take care of the infirmary and the two teenage orphans (Shigusa and Mox) who had been living with him. Rice, the NPC hardholder, doesn't know if Kine is worth trusting with the job, but she lets him sleep in infirmary, until she needs to find someone better.<br/><br/><b>Charmer</b>, a socially-awkward <b>Brainer</b>, wears a suit and just wants friends. He works for Rice, doing her dirty work, and sleeps in what must have once been a janitorial closet in her's tower. She treats him like a pet. He's kinda pathetic; the type of guy who's not actually a bad person, but whom no one wants to be friends with. He thinks he hears someone (or something) trying to talk to him in the psychic maelstrom.<br/><br/><b>Chaplain</b>, a <b>Gunlugger</b> with a grudge. Years ago, her father ran what passes for an orphanage in Apocalypse World, but another unfortunate incident with the nearby rival hardhold ended with his death and the deaths of most of the children. She's taken her revenge the individuals directly responsible, but still holds Newton, the rival hardholder, responsible. She works for Rice as an enforcer, providing/ensuring town security.<br/><br/><br/>The hardhold:<br/><br/><b>Ohm</b> is built around a tiny town centred around an old, barely-working hydro-electric dam; the one thing this place has going for it is energy.<br/><br/>The town itself consists of a variety of run-down pre-fab buildings, leftovers from the dam's construction, all of which are in disrepair. This includes one or two larger buildings that were once workers' quarters, a handful of small houses for the engineers, and a bunch of storage garages. There's also a large, concrete control tower, with a good view of the reservoir, the town, and the river below. A single road runs through Ohm and over the dam, but the tunnel into the mountain-side has collapsed, leaving Ohm with one point of entry. This point of entry has been barred off with make-shift barriers: barbed-wire, broken vehicles, etc.<br/><br/>The nearest rival hold is called the <b>Fort</b>, an old military base run by a guy named Newton.<br/><br/><br/>NPCs:<br/><br/><b>Rice</b>, 30-something, the hardholder. She's a hot blonde bitch who runs this place with an iron fist or a sympathetic ear, depending on the day.<br/><br/>Her guards:<br/><b>Lars</b>, a skin-head hick who's got the hots for Chaplain.<br/><b>Stinky</b>, an ugly woman who hovers around Rice like a lapdog, feeling something like a combination of awe, lust, envy, and love.<br/><b>Shit Head</b> pretty much lives up to his name.<br/><b>Dog</b>, the little one, young, talks a lot of shit. Kinda wants to be Charmer's friend. Thinks Kine is a faggot.<br/><b><br/>Shigusa</b>, 14 years old, one of Kine's charges, he and Mox are like brother and sister.<br/><b>Mox</b>, the other charge, 16 years old. They watch out for each other, but also make mistakes together.<br/><br/><b>Foster</b>, one of said mistakes. Somewhere in his 30s. He does a lot of drugs and attempts to prey on the kids.<br/><br/><b>Partridge</b>, the most polite motherfucking cowboy you will ever meet. Came into town with a message from Newton, wanting to make peace.<br/><br/><b>The Entity</b> in the psychic maelstrom. I have no idea what this thing is, and I might actually be happy keeping it that way.<br/><br/><br/>Other NPCs, mentioned but not seen on-screen (yet):<br/><br/><b>Diamond</b>, another of Rice's guards, who was found wandering around town this morning, clawing his own eyes out and screaming incoherently. Apparently Charmer's fault.<br/><b>Inch</b>, a messenger boy.<br/><b>Dew</b>, a hot girl.<br/><br/><b>Abe</b>, dead medic, Kine's mentor.<br/><br/><b>Newton</b>, the rival hardholder.<br/><b>Tao</b>, Newton's medic, old friend (maybe lover?) of Abe, years ago, before things went bad between Newton and Rice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301594/#Comment_301594" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-20T22:20:53+00:00" title="November 20, 2010 10:20PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick summary of the events of the first session, which we played for about 2 hours. I was skipping around the threads more often than I make it seem here, but this way it's easier to read.<br/><br/><b>Charmer</b> wakes up to the sound of Dog pounding on his door, delivering the news that Rice wants to see him. He goes to her apartments at the top of the control tower, and Rice informs him that they found Diamond running around town clawing his eyes out. Charmer cops to messing with Diamond's mind after Diamond threated him with violence for not helping him win over Dew, a random girl from the town. Rice is understandably pissed, but Charmer gets out of it by promising her that he'll find out why Newton has been increasing his raids lately. Charmer then goes to relax on the dam, where Dog finds him, talking shit, offering to accompany him to the Fort to find out what's up.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, <b>Kine</b> wakes up to find that Shigusa and Mox are missing. They do this all the time, and can usually be found hanging out on the porch of Chaplain's house, so Kine goes there to find them. The house is currently empty, the door unlocked. Kine goes inside only to find Shig and Mox sitting naked on the bed, doing drugs with Foster (also naked). With a very casual anger, Kine zaps Foster with a taser, going aggro to convince the kids to go home. He fucks up and accidentally shocks Mox as well. This doesn't mix well with the drugs (which happen to open one's mind to psychic maelstrom), and Mox falls into convulsions. Kine rushes her back to the infirmary (a small garage converted to this purpose), leaving Foster to stumble off into town. Knowing the nature of the drug, he runs to find Charmer, hoping he can help.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, <b>Chaplain</b> has been up all night on watch, staring at the empty, broken road, when she sees what looks like an a solitary figuring walking towards town. She goes out to investigate alone, and it turns out that it's a cowboy (who later introduces himself as Partridge), saying he has a message for Rice from Newton, the rival hardholder. Chaplain orders him to the ground, which he does peacefully. She then knocks him out, ties him up, and literally drags him back into town.<br/><br/>Kine finds Charmer hanging out on the dam, and tells him what's going on with Mox. Charmer goes, Dog following for the excitement. In the infirmary, Charmer sends his brain into the psychic maelstrom to see if he can figure out how to wake Mox up, and encounters the entity that he keeps sensing. He follows the Entity deep into the psychic maelstrom, taking some harm while doing so, and loses track of the fact that he's supposed to be looking for a way to help Mox. He's just so damned excited to be talking to this thing. He asks a few questions ("What are you? Can we be friends?") and gets very cryptic answers ("I am this. You are not this.").<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Chaplain meets with Lars and Shit Head, who come down from the tower to see this guy that Chaplain is dragging down the street. When Chaplain tells them to get Rice, Shit Head gets in her face about her having no right to order them around. Lars, who has the hots for Chaplain and an apparently short temper, shoots Shit Head, blowing his ear clean off.<br/><br/>Kine, waiting for Charmer to finish his thing in the psychic maelstrom, hears the shot and goes to patch up Shit Head. Upon returning to the infirmary, Kine finds that Charmer managed to make no progress in helping Mox, and instead is babbling about some entity in the psychic maelstrom. Annoyed, Kine begins to work on Mox with the infirmary's resources, and soon realizes that he's going to need the help of Tao, his mentor's old friend, who works for Newton in the Fort.<br/><br/>Outside, Partridge comes too, and still polite as ever, agrees to tell Chaplain the message if she removes his bonds. He tells her that he was sent by Newton to make peace, because there's been rumours flying around that some man, possibly a hocus-type, is brainwashing people and building an army out in the wastes. Rice finally comes down and hears about this, and decides to send Chaplain to the Fort to speak with Newton.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301595/#Comment_301595" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-20T22:21:58+00:00" title="November 20, 2010 10:21PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few random thoughts:<br/><br/>The Apocalypse World rules are very heavy. Not in terms of mechanics, but in terms of the GMing advice. Every time I read the book, I find new clarifications and points of advice that I hadn't noticed/remembered, and it's going to take a lot of play before I know the principles and moves like the back of my hand. <br/><br/>I definitely wasn't on my best game while running this, as I was both lacking sleep and still recovering from a nasty bug I had earlier in the week.<br/><br/>I didn't ask as many questions as I hoped to. I asked a lot during character creation, though, which gave me good details to spring off from.<br/><br/>I didn't have as much interaction between the PCs as I would've liked. My fault for missing the note about bringing them on-screen in pairs and groups. I instead started them in 3 different places with different things happening to each.<br/><br/>I sorta ended up giving them all a "quest" at the end of the session: go to the Fort, investigate. Not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.<br/><br/><br/>Mistakes with moves:<br/><br/>I didn't have Chaplain roll when she told Partridge to get on his knees, because he wasn't offering any resistance. Should this have been a Going Aggro roll, despite that? After all, she was doing it.<br/><br/>We used Seize by Force for when Charmer was trying to follow the Entity. I'm not sure that was the right call, as there wasn't really a fight going on. Arguably, he was fighting against the maelstrom itself, but I think the more appropriate move would've been Act Under Fire. Whoops.<br/><br/>Having Lars shoot Shit Head didn't work like I'd hoped. It was the result of Chaplain's missed roll to manipulate Lars into getting Shit Head off her case. I played it as Lars taking things too far, but it didn't really have much of a consequence, and I realize now that it doesn't quite fit into any of the MC moves. We were also running low on time at that point in the night, so maybe I would've explored the consequences more had we had more time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301597/#Comment_301597" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-20T22:35:15+00:00" title="November 20, 2010 10:35PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2010 10:35PM by DannyK.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite><br/><br/>Mistakes with moves:<br/><br/>I didn't have Chaplain roll when she told Partridge to get on his knees, because he wasn't offering any resistance.

Arguably, he was fighting against the maelstrom itself, but I think the more appropriate move would've been Act Under Fire. Whoops.<br/><br/>Having Lars shoot Shit Head didn't work like I'd hoped. It was the result of Chaplain's missed roll to manipulate Lars into getting Shit Head off her case. I played it as Lars taking things too far, but it didn't really have much of a consequence, and I realize now that it doesn't quite fit into any of the MC moves. We were also running low on time at that point in the night, so maybe I would've explored the consequences more had we had more time.</blockquote>\nI found it takes a while to get comfortable with the moves, but in general I don't make the players roll if they're getting somebody to do something they're perfectly willing to do -- it's that Say Yes Or Roll The Dice thing again.  <br/><br/>About the blown roll, I've found that the rules are a little confusing about what constitutes a "hard move", but I think it always has to point back at the PC somehow, affect them directly or something they care about.  It's also good in my experience if it's pretty heavy-handed and irrevocable, like the book says, so maybe something like "Lars shoots Shit Head in the neck.  As he thrashes and bleeds out on the street, Lars looks into your eyes and says 'You owe me one.'

Going strictly with the book, the MC is indeed required to "ask questions like crazy" during the First Session, and also to keep asking questions well after that, but the questions you're supposed to ask are more like: details of where the character's live ('cause they should know), things they've done in the past, their daily routine, relationships with the NPCs <i>you</i> throw at them, and so on. And especially the small details of what things look, sound, smell, feel and taste like, and how it's like <i>for them</i> to open their brain to the maelstrom. Note how, according to the principle, you -- the MC -- are supposed to\n<blockquote>Address yourself to the characters, not the players.</blockquote>\nThat is: <i>all</i> the time. So, quoting Johnny's blog:\n<blockquote>GM: (Points at me.)  It\u2019s first thing in the morning.  Someone is pounding on your door.  Who is it?<br/><br/>Me: Ya, \u201cWho is it??\u201d I say.<br/><br/>GM: Okay, but who is it?  I\u2019m asking you.<br/><br/>Me: Oh!  Well, it\u2019s uhmm\u2026 It\u2019s our hardholder, Rice.  No!  It\u2019s this punk-ass piece of shit named uhh, named Dog.  Rice sent him, she wants to see me.<br/><br/>GM: Okay, cool.  \u201dWake up!\u201d Dog growls, pounding on the door again.  \u201dRice wants you.   Now!\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nand:\n<blockquote>Me: I burst into Rice\u2019s office.  \u201dYou wanted to see me boss?\u201d<br/><br/>GM: \u201cYes,\u201d she says.  There are four other people in the room.  She looks pissed off.  Now, why did she want to see you?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure how Mike was addressing <i>Charmer</i>, there, rather than directly addressing Johnny. Maybe it's implied that this is not at all exceptional? That Charmer's woken up by Rice's henchman pretty often and that Rice's pissed off about the same one or three old things <i>all the time</i>, so this amounts to routine? And even in that case, I can't see how Johnny making up everything about Dog doesn't "cross the line".<br/><br/>(As an aside, when playing <i>The Mountain Witch</i> -- rather than <i>Apocalypse World</i> -- as the GM, I ask questions almost exactly like Mike does in Johnny's account. That's because in TMW non-GM players <i>do have</i> authority over the backstory, provided what they make up is related with their own Dark Fate; and still they usually have a choice whether to answer questions like those, or else the question is addressed to whoever first wants to answer it, not to a particular player.)<br/><br/>Another thing which felt "odd" to me is Johnny's conflict resolution example, with a somewhat large-scale (and apparently pretty significant, or doesn't he care much about that "lady friend" of him?) conflict done over with a single <i>Seize by force</i> move, plus quite a lot of the GM narrating the PC's actions as part of the consequences of the roll. My gut feeling is that a situation like the example one should be tense enough to warrant "zooming in" to it, describing actions in some more detail (including the \xabI seize her back by force!\xbb \xabCool. How?\xbb part) while possibly involving multiple moves (Reading the sitch, for one) depending on the exact details. But I get that the example on Johnny's blog was meant to explain how this new game "is different" and, I surmise, is not from actual play \u2014 thus, in retrospect I'm probably trying to read too much into it.<br/><br/>All of the above coming from an AW novice, btw, so I for one admit I could be wrong.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite>Having Lars shoot Shit Head didn't work like I'd hoped.

So either I'm misremembering or John is, but I know that I came up with the reason myself, on the spot. (Edit: Oh, I think I remember. I had Rice tell him about finding Diamond going crazy, and then asked Charmer why Diamond went crazy. Charmer fessed up to the crime.) But you're absolutely right about crossing the line. The questions being asked should be about the characters' viewpoints and understandings, not about letting the players just create things. Thanks for reinforcing that for me.
