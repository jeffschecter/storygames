I work as a designer for an e-learning company that creates custom learning applications for a wide variety of clients. We're trying to move towards creating more games/simulations and we have monthly, informal game nights in which we play and examine various games, look at how they work and find out how we can perhaps apply some of what we see in our courses.<br/><br/>It struck me that RPGs would offer some interesting alternatives to the boardgames we've been playing up until now. Unfortunately, I'm a hanger-on here, having never actually played an indie game, despite being very enthused about doing so some day. I've read a bunch here and elsewhere, and listened to podcasts on the topic, so I think I have a general feel for the bigger games in the scene, but have no real experience either running or playing anything outside the likes of DnD and WoD.<br/><br/>What I'd like is a game that would provide the following:<br/>-Rules that are tightly integrated and specific to the premise of the game. I think Grey Ranks is a great example of this, but probably too heavy for this instance.<br/>-Non-dorky subject matter: Nothing too fantasy or sci-fi. Most of my co-workers are going to be a bit leery of gaming going into this, I think, and I don't want to scare them away. <br/>-Nothing too touchy-feely. We all get along very well, but I don't want anything to prompt awkwardness.<br/>-Short learning curve, short setup, short play. <br/>-Humour's a plus.<br/>-Games that have pre-written demos would also be a plus.<br/><br/>Hopefully this isn't too tall an order.

The rule book includes tables to generate quests, which in and of itself may be of interest to your research.<br/>In addition, because the characters compete for Glory as they cooperate to complete the quest, Agon has a built in system to recognize and reward individual performance in pursuit of a team mission--something human resource managers, project leaders, and, I suppose, teachers could use.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105072/#Comment_105072" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T18:48:02+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  6:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word of caution about InSpectres - I can see creating a fictional workplace as a potentially very awkward thing depending on tensions at your job.

I heard that part on Sons of Kryos, but I'm not clear on what comes after. Also, would Contenders work? I've heard a lot of good things and the subject matter is kind of geek-neutral.

Very fast set-up time. PTA's pitch sessions can be an hour or more. If you set down the idea for the show, character generation can take a while as people figure out how the descriptors work, and how they want to fit in the world. In Contenders, you're a boxer, that's it. You have a couple choices to make regarding stats and connections, but that's it. <br/>2. Contenders is very, very grounded. Everyone's aware of boxing. They may not like it, but the game will at least make it interesting. Contenders tends towards the dark, but it's an effective, fun darkness that can just be about personal failure instead of falling into drugs and crime (Note: If you want to 'win' the endgame, don't ever use Pain in a fight).<br/>3. Contenders constraints lead to a very simple elegance. You can only have a limited number of types of scenes, and the fights are fun and fast and feel like boxing. From a game design perspective, I think this would be enlightening, as would the GMless nature of the game.<br/>4. Contenders is just damn fun, almost regardless of RP buy-in. Even if it's played purely strategically, it offers a wealth of moves and tactics. Add even a tiny layer of roleplaying, and the fun grows a lot. <br/><br/>I will say, do not run a game for your co-workers you've never played. You really want to be able to sit down and play immediately, so having the structures of play reinforced through play is super important.<br/><br/>Good luck, Jeff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105120/#Comment_105120" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T09:30:50+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  9:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            d6 Star Wars is the correct answer, you can usually find it used for about ten bucks floating around used bookstores.<br/><br/>Everyone knows Star Wars, it has a clean and easy to understand system and clear choices, nobody ever says "you can do annnnything you waaaant" in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105121/#Comment_105121" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T09:33:43+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  9:33AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contenders is a good suggestion.
