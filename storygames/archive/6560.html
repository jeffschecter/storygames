This isn\u2019t really anything new, and I\u2019ve been around long enough that I\u2019ve seen it done before. But, for the first time, it occurred to me that Robert\u2019s Rules are just another form of game design. Roleplaying design, even. Consider this: you have stake-setting (by moving and seconding a main motion) and conflict resolution (through subsidiary motions and finally voting). You have a GM (the moderator). You have folks responsible to know the rules and check things in the rulebooks (the parliamentarians). You even have someone whose is responsible to write the Actual Play report (the secretary).<br/><br/>That\u2019s right. Robert\u2019s Rules are just another way of roleplaying.<br/><br/>Being serious, I wonder how much insight we game designers could gather from the procedural structures of Robert\u2019s Rules. Their existence to structure a formal social situation is anecdotal evidence that System Does Matter, yet their design is such that the group can hack them on the fly, by moving to suspend certain rules and the like. They also acknowledge that human judgment is necessary as part of the System, and also provide a way for the GM/moderator to be overruled by the rest of the assembly. There\u2019s a lot that we could glean from this resource.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145457/#Comment_145457" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T11:09:39+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 11:09AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not too far from Polaris' key phrases, is it?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
