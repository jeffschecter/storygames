"Early ideas tend to have disproportionate influence over the rest of the conversation," [says] Loran Nordgren, a professor at the Kellogg School. "They establish the kinds of norms, or cement the idea of what are appropriate examples or potential solutions for the problem."<br/><br/>Certainly there are many game situations in which turn order is intended to grant exactly that privilege, with later ideas following upon and building off of earlier ones.  The step-by-step formation of time-bound narratives is one such area.  But in other situations - when open, spontaneous and egalitarian idea generation is the intention - this "anchoring" of early ideas may cause undesired effects.<br/><br/>The solution put forward in the article is called "Brainwriting", in which participants silently write down their ideas before collecting and revealing them all at once.  This technique gives everyone at the table an equal chance to have their idea accepted on its own merit, rather than how well it fits in with things already said.  Depending on the intended nature and flow of idea-generation used in your collaborative game, you may want to consider giving brainwriting a try.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438062/#Comment_438062" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-02T16:55:29+00:00" title="September  2, 2014  4:55PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting!

The Sixth Seal) lets the players write secrets to be revealed later in the game, after introducing some the characters and probably some of the setting. Each note is then later revealed one by one as the group plays on, as a form of plot twist. This works as a nice uncertainty and is free from the influence of others, apart from the setting given from the book.<br/><br/><b>Svart av kval, vit av lust</b> (Eng. Black of Despair, White of Lust) let all the players brainstorm the setting, what kind of vampires it inhabits, and all people and relations. All this is done openly which means that early ideas gets cemented so others can build on them, and it should be like that, because it's something social we do together.<br/><br/>The first game is probably an example of brainwriting and the other one brainstorming. Both got their places and should therefor be handled differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438081/#Comment_438081" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-03T08:31:35+00:00" title="September  3, 2014  8:31AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is very true. I have been in a few design sessions and they follow the improve style. That is some one puts forth an idea then everyone else adds an "and" or "but." This allows fast design but a bad idea at the beginning can throw things. In a game one player can throw the story and all the rest can do is tack on fixes but not stop the direction outright.<br/><br/>You can also do note cards/post-it notes of ideas and share round by round, building as you go. Thats a more scrum/agile style of design. I should write up an agile take on game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438281/#Comment_438281" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T18:40:51+00:00" title="September 11, 2014  6:40PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this stuff.  I'm going to play devil's advocate here and say that I feel like it's possible for certain individuals, if they're emotionally/mentally prepared to be somewhat more unaffected by the anchoring phenomenon here.  Basically by focusing mostly on spouting out contributions without listening to others.  But expecting this much mental awareness and energy at a typical brainstorming session or meeting is, almost certainly, having unrealistic expectations.  Just thought it was worth thinking about.<br/><br/>I'll also add a question: wouldn't anchoring affect each individual?  I.E. my own early written ideas affect later ones I posit.

The purpose of a traditional brainstorming session is to get EVERY idea out on the table before organizing, clustering, or culling them.  So anchoring, because it creates limits, would work against that goal.  Anchoring (if it is to happen) would happen in the step AFTER brainstorming.<br/><br/>Brainstorming (or brainwriting) as a methodology applies to certain exercises or subsystems you might consider building or implementing in a game, but certainly not all.  Sometimes (quite a lot of the time), you <i>do</i> want anchoring and linear agglutination.  That's an easy way to build a causal narrative in temporal order, for instance.  Without that, FIASCO would be a very different game.  But there are other situations - maybe brainstorming on a Palette for Microscope, or brainstorming on what games the group wants to play next - in which you want to get everyone's true opinions or ideas, <i>and</i> you want to avoid letting the first speakers (or the most frequent speakers) "dominate" or overly influence the others.  In these situations linearity is not the goal, but rather a "throwing a wide net" to gather as many ideas as possible.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">@Big_J_Money</a> - certain individuals; for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438288/#Comment_438288" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-12T01:31:02+00:00" title="September 12, 2014  1:31AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As they speak out, perhaps people always anchor their ideas to the current context.
