We're all really excited about it, and even have a kickstarter up to help support the event. <br/><br/>We would love to see anyone nearby out for the event that includes food, boardgaming, indie games, and game design. I'd love to see you out! I'm thinking of running Monsterhearts, Kagematsu, and the Tribunal! Aaron Brown from NYC Nerd is helping organize, as well as Travis Scott, and Aaron Sturgill in Columbus Ohio. It promises to be a really fun weekend.<br/><br/>Here's the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ohnerd/oh-games-weekend-nov-30-dec-2" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a>.<br/><br/><i>Join OH Nerd for a weekend of games, food, and fun!
