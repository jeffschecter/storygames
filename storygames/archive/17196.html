The last couple of months, the project seems to have gained some steam.<br/><br/>It looks to me that the primary writing phase is nearing the end, and after that, there should be editing, layout, etc. There already is artwork for the project.<br/><br/>The basic system looks to be very similar to the original Amber Diceless system (it's <i>Powered By Erick Wujcik's Diceless Roleplaying</i>, after all), but the available powers are new or re-done (the magic system). All (most?) references to Zelazny's work have been removed, only the concept of alternate worlds and <i>shadow</i> remain.<br/><br/>It will be a stand-alone game, which could also be used to extend the Amber Diceless system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390104/#Comment_390104" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T15:57:44+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  3:57PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2012 6:48PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks for the information.

In brief: take Amber DRPG and revise powers; you've pretty much got it. I find some of the tweaks interesting.<br/><br/>There are some cosmetic changes. Attribute auctions are still there, but there is a key Power that's subtly different. I like the take on Umbra vs. Eidolon (Chaos vs. Pattern), but it introduces the Wardens of the Stairs. Imagine Broken Pattern without the emo, and you've pretty much got it. However, as far as I can tell, only the Wardens gain "Exegesis" and can communicate with Gossamer natives "naturally." It makes choosing the "lesser" of three factions more versatile at the expense of not having the raw power Order and Chaos embody. Shape Shifting is not a separate Power; it's part of another. It makes logical sense, and I think it'll be interesting casting a Cast member into a void to activate some instinctive shifting. There IS a way for a Master of the Stairs to extend the protective "bubble" into inhospitable Gossamers, but it has limited range.<br/><br/>I like how they treat the Abyss, now termed Shadows, and the Dwimmerlaik (the beings within the Shadow). The way I envision the cosmology: imagine a World Tree (with Christmas ornaments). Each ornament is a Gossamer (Shadow in Amber). Each branch is a representation of the Grand Stair (I think of it as a Trump conduit). The space between is the Shadow (Abyss in Amber). Unlike the handwavium Brand and the Abyss gained in the DRPG, the Dwimmerlaik and Shadow serve a purpose; that purpose is up to the GM.<br/><br/>Task resolution is DRPG style with some extra guidelines. I appreciated the "scaling" provided: Average (Human) to Superior (Chaos) to Paragon (Amber) has some recommended scales. Likewise, the unopposed section includes "Yes, And," "Yes," and "Yes, But" for Good, Zero and Bad Stuff characters. While basic and old news for some, I thought this section handled it almost perfectly.<br/><br/>What sold me were the Annunaki and Minotaur. Taking the latter first, the Minotaur permeates Gossamer worlds because it's a physical representation of Reality on the Grand Stair. Brilliant. All those tales are analogs for what happens to Real People in the Real World. I have an unhealthy enjoyment of Sitchin's Earth Chronicles, and reading about the Annunaki made me smile. Not only because the term exists in the RPG, but because it implies the "constructed" nature of Earth's reality. Insert David Icke references as needed.<br/><br/>In Amber DRPG, I enjoyed Chaos and Shape Shifting; in Lords of Gossamer and Shadow, I actually feel more attached to the Eidolon and their blueprints of awesome. Because that's one very, very big difference between Amber and Gossamers: Being a Master of Order means NOT influencing probability. You impose your will or leave it alone; probability is not in your Domain. You don't summon things (that's Invocation) or teleport to things. You reinforce or make things better... at the expense of its Chaos.<br/><br/>Creatures and Artifacts receive a nice revision. It actually mentions the point savings in using Artifacts but notes their limitation. Much appreciated. Yes, my Icon (Trump) powered Dagger can do X. Without it, I am nothing. With Pattern, I could "stumble" into it. With Chaos, I could reach out to it. With Eidolon and Umbra...? Not so much. I need it. I want it. And I can't afford to lose it. I could create an Icon (Trump) of it, though. Take away my Icons; I am nothing. Unless I, like Corwin, inscribe a one shot Icon and utilize it. Icons (Trumps) become what they were: paths to communication. Also appreciated because Trumps, Amber DRPG style, were rather super powered.<br/><br/>The one thing that stood out as a Dislike with my cursory read: Sorcery. It still uses lynchpins; it still takes forever to properly cast a spell. You won't be Elminster; you won't be Gandalf. A single lynchpin takes five minutes to complete. Ergo, hanging a spell (handled well by the book, by the way), and leaving ONE lynchpin will still take a minimum of five minutes to complete. I'll probably stick to my house rules for that: each lynchpin is a "segment" of casting time. Casting a spell from beginning to end will take some time; casting everything but target and range will take two D&amp;D style segments.<br/><br/>So, taken by itself, "Lords of Gossamer and Shadow," for me, is a three out of five experience. It's pretty average overall, but their suggestions to make it diceless is kind of cool. However, there are still "engine" level issues that I'd address. Taken as a successor of "Amber: the Diceless Role-Playing Game?" Four out of five. Brilliant. Awesome. Generalized almost perfectly. Almost. The one thing missing, and included in the original, is crafting your own Power. That single inclusion would allow a GM to truly generalize the setting to anything he or she could want.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo" title="Maese_Mateo"><img alt="Maese_Mateo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/897/nVSZHDY85YP2W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo">Maese_Mateo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422316/#Comment_422316" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T11:54:50+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 11:54AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I understood lynchpins is that you take the apropiate time while casting the spell, <i>before</i> hanging it. Then, when you release the spell, you don't have to actually invest 5 minutes per lynchpin (you already did that), just a second or so to name it.<br/><br/>While that's not explicitely explained in the book (I had to read the Sorcery section several times to get how it worked), it mentions (page 41) that it only requires a few gestures or words to complete a lynchpin, which is enough for a fast opponent to cast a Cantrip or attack you in order to disrupt your casting. So the way I undertood it, you can totally play Elminster or Galdalf (take into consideration I've never played Amber before, so I may be wrong with my interpretation of the rules).<br/><br/>I've also noticed that if you really want to play a sorcerer, you need an artifact to which hang your spells, otherwise you won't be able to do much (since you can only hang one spell -maybe two- in your memory alone).

After reading most of it (still getting to the Dwimmerlaik NPCs) I'm still happy that someone who really cares about the system is putting out new stuff for it.<br/><br/>Complaints: The system is, if anything, too close to the original. For instance, I'm sad that the magic system remains intact - Amber always had one of the worst. Also, Eidolon Mastery seems to be substantially underpowered (or at least much less flexible) when compared to Umbra Mastery, for the same number of points. That seems like a minor thing, but Eidolon should be a big part of the setting. <br/><br/>Compliments: The book captures a lot of the feel of Amber, and I can see much of the books and the old game set in this new setting. There's some good new advice that does not entirely overlap with the old advice.<br/><br/>It's partially a new game, and partially a retro-clone, and I can live with that just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RitePublishing" title="RitePublishing"><img alt="RitePublishing" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RitePublishing">RitePublishing</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424957/#Comment_424957" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T09:14:35+00:00" title="November 29, 2013  9:14AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just thought i would let folks know it goes on Retail sale Dec 1st.
