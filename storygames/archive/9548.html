It is an unfortunate hazard of my occupation. However, lately I have been thinking about it in regards to games. The how and why of our interaction with game content.<br/><br/>I subscribe to DnD Insider, and it does some interesting things with content delivery, and some things that suck. But it is also the only example of an attempt to utilize the strengths of the delivery method for the content it is providing. But, like I said, it is pretty fucking weak-sauce still. <br/><br/>So that begs the question, what would work better? What features would engage you? If the mode of delivery is electronic, what pie-in-the-sky ideas do you have for that delivery mechanism? I can think of a few things, but I want to hear of what other people think.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211863/#Comment_211863" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T05:52:12+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  5:52AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does DnD insider do for those of us who don't frequent...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211867/#Comment_211867" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T06:04:37+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  6:04AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a Trail of Cthulhu character generator.

So the rulebook, in electronic form, would let us prep the session and design characters. An attendance thing would then let people say whether they were coming to the game session or not. <br/><br/>At the game session, you'd either print out character sheets for everyone attending or use laptops to display character sheets at the table. There would be an electronic dice roller that would not only display the dice but, by interacting with the rules text, tell you the result of the die roll. For example, for Poison'd, it would keep track of the three levels of escalation and then tell you the consequences.<br/><br/>There would sound effects and music, too, which you could play on demand or at a given mechanical cue: for example, someone dying. There would definitely be looped sound effects, like birdsong and dungeons. In fact, you could add acoustic effects, such as reverb, when you played in a dungeon scene.<br/><br/>Obviously this would all be at the touch of the button: the GM clicks the "Brogroth's Lair" scene, for which she's chosen the "Dungeon" ambience, and the dungeon sound effects and music kick in, while the stats for Brogroth appear on the screen. The die roller interacts with those stats, of course. There'd be a little slider for increasing the tension of the music, although prolonged combats would automatically increase tension.<br/><br/>You could also record the session, which would be automatically archived and transcribed along with the die rolls. It would be possible, too, to participate in the session remotely, via Twitter, Skype or similar. The session would be automatically streamed and made into a podcast.<br/><br/>Errata to the rules would be downloaded and installed automatically and there'd be little micro-additions, like scenarios or pregenerated characters, which you could buy for a dollar.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211893/#Comment_211893" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T07:34:21+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  7:34AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham's pie-in-the-sky idea is also where I'd like to see it go, only on something less obtrusive than a laptop. Like a Kindle or something -- and some way to add your own tags and notes as you went. But, yeah, super-duper-deep relational links baked into the content for maximum at-the-table utility. <br/><br/>And that, unfortunately, almost certainly breaks Andy's excellent idea of taking some of the load off the content-creators. Unless...hm. Unless you had a way to crowdsource the relational links: as the # of people who feel item A is useful in connection to table X, that link rises in prominence in a sort of voting fashion (like how Amazon connects books you're looking at to "people who bought this book also bought..."). I'm not smart enough to know how to guard against shenanigans, other than relying on the good will of the users to not muck it up.<br/><br/>RPG rules/materials have been presented in linear fashion for so long that imagining a non-linear version is sort of mindblowing, actually.

So you can basically make your own supplements for your campaign that have all the material you want and nothing more. Or even rules packages for each player, e.g. everyone gets only the list of feats available for their class.<br/><br/>That's not really pie-in-the-sky though. More along those lines would be an update-able book / character sheet. So normally it only shows you the powers available for your character at their current level, and you can ask it for the ones available next level or way down the line. And when you hit paragon or epic level you tell it your new class and it updates its view. Then there's a character sheet mode toggle, which shows a list of your character's powers with short or no description and adds record-keeping for number of uses, HP, XP, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
