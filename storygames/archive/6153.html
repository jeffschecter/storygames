Every time you suck someone you get an Awesome token you can save for later.<br/><br/>and the abilities:<br/><br/>VAMPIRE COOLNESS<br/>You are way cooler than other people.  People can see it in your eyes unless you're wearing sunglasses.  Tap your sunglasses or just give a cold blue stare, and people have to acknowledge how cool you are.  You get +3 to Stubbornness and Eloquence when you use it but don't speak.  <br/><br/>GENRE BREAKER<br/>Screw the genre.  Screw the GM too.  You get to bring a gun, two katanas, and an awesome trenchcoat.  Your eyes glow red and sunlight just gives you a bad sunburn, not immediate death.  You have 3 weapons, and special gear, and you can add your special gear bonus in combat.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136959/#Comment_136959" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T06:22:21+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  6:22AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be rude, but I don't think Red Box Hack needs your "contribution".

So any such contribution is awesome.<br/><br/>For example, when I first picked up the Red Box Hack, I changed every class to reflect what I like about World of Warcraft. I threw out all the weapon categories and replaced them with my own DPS (damage per second) system, and changed all the class abilities to make them more powerful.<br/><br/>In this case, I'm wondering if your Vampire hack could be better if you bring every class of vampire in as an ability?<br/><br/>This will help:<br/><a href="http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/top-70-vampire-movies-of-all-time/" rel="nofollow">http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/top-70-vampire-movies-of-all-time/</a><br/><br/>BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA VAMPIRE<br/>You have tons of resources: Mansions, servants, castles. Once per session, you can summon your servants to whisk you away to a hidden fortress where you are all safe... This time.<br/><br/>BLADE VAMPIRE<br/>You are totally fucking sweet. You do your own style of martial arts, that's like half Karate and half Wing Chun and half Street, and can still do backflips and stuff. When fighting other vampires, your fists and kicks are rated a Very Heavy weapon (with no encumberance).<br/><br/>KATE BECKINSALE VAMPIRE<br/>Did you see Underworld? Underworld: Evolution? Well, don't bother with the latter. But the former is a pretty decent genre vampire flick. Also, Kate Beckinsale as a vampire? Totally fucking hot. In fact, I noticed that she was in that shitty movie "Pearl Harbor", and I was so waiting for her to bust out with double pistils, bite Ben Affleck in the neck while shooting him 12 times in the gut. But it didn't happen. But that's ok, it was kind of a crappy movie. But Underworld was sweet, because it was like Kate Backinsale in leather for 2 hours being sexy-cool.<br/>Oh, shit, right, ability... ok, if you wear tight leather clothing, you roll one extra d12 to any social roll, against both sexes.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137285/#Comment_137285" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T21:03:49+00:00" title="March 31, 2008  9:03PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the person you suck should judge how many awesome tokens it was worth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137557/#Comment_137557" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-01T22:06:05+00:00" title="April  1, 2008 10:06PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fellow player, one token.
