I love A Penny for My Thoughts but the origilal Facts and Reassurances  are not suitable for playing in a dreamlike environment. <br/><br/>I hope you will like this hack.<br/>I`m only looking for suggestions...<br/>I'd like to know your opinion about it. Do the questions hit the target?<br/>Do you have any suggestions on modifying the facts document and the questionaire?<br/><br/>Thank you in advance for your kindly reply<br/>... and sorry for my English...<br/><br/><br/><b> A Lynch For My Thoughts</b> / working title<br/>Variant for  A Penny For My Thoughts<br/>Set in the surreal and dreamlike universe of  David Lynch<br/><br/><br/><b>Facts &amp; \u2026not so much Reassurances</b><br/><br/>\u2981   <b>It is the twenty-first century.</b> Technology \u2013 cars, planes, computer networks, mobile phones, etc. \u2013 has not advanced beyond your hazy familiarity with it, nor has humanity been thrown into a new dark age, although the unknown is creeping around every corner.<br/><br/>\u2981   <b>The world is a mundane place.</b> Its wonders and terrors come from simple and personal things, like the birth of a child or the death of a love one.  Rest assumed that you could be haunted by spirits. But an inexplicable mystery haunts your existence and, in your restlessness, dreams and nightmare, reality and hallucinations become entangled, in a never-ending short circuit. If you remember spirits, surreal people or situations, sensations uncontrollable by reason, metaphysical locations, don\u2019t label them automatically as figments of you imagination. Reality often bends to unreality, layers overlap and things aren\u2019t always what they seem.<br/><br/>\u2981   <b>You are a normal, everyday person.</b>This isn\u2019t to say that you might not be a remarkable individual, but feats like leaping across rooftops or stop bullets with your bare hands are simply impossible . While indeed, some people or entities manage to manipulate minds, see the future, look beyond reality.<br/><br/>\u2981   <b>Your condition was caused by physiological or psychological trauma surrounding events in your personal life.</b> It was not caused by a shadowy government conspiracy or similar organization. The drama of your past is as heavy as granite, while you wait for a release that may never come.<br/><br/><b>Questionaire</b><br/><br/>1.        <b>Recall a secret you hide deeply inside</b>   $$  <br/><br/>    When I think off ___________________________________________, I remember:<br/><br/>    What is it that you never told to anyone?<br/><br/>2.   <b>Recall a disquieting memory </b>  $$$  <br/><br/>     When I think off ___________________________________________, I remember:<br/><br/>     What was disquieting about it?<br/><br/>3.   <b>Do you recall the intensely evil event that caused your loss of memory? </b>      $$$$<br/> <br/>When I think off ___________________________________________, I remember<br/><br/>     What is it that more than anything else are you afraid of losing?<br/><br/><b>Do you want to remember your past?</b><br/><br/>YES      NO<br/><br/><br/>If you like, here you have the <b>DOWNLOADABLE PDF</b> <a href="http://www.formatoql.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Penny_Lynch_ENG.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.formatoql.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Penny_Lynch_ENG.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451799/#Comment_451799" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-08T19:57:05+00:00" title="March  8, 2016  7:57PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea.
