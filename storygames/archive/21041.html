So when monsters attack the players, instead of monsters making attack rolls, the players make a "defense"-roll with a new "defense" mod derived from (and used instead of) AC vs a DC derived from the monster's attack value.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>In the other thread, I wrote:\n<blockquote>Sometimes I toss out a DC instead of the prompt. "She's trying to sink her claws into you! DC 15"<br/>I'm thinking of adding back the "What do you do?" after the 15 but it has fallen flat so far. I've either gotten:<br/>"Er, I try to defend myself, what do you mean?" Or they've ignored the attack. It undermines the magic of "What do you do?".<br/>(If we were playing Dungeon World proper, "She's trying to sink her claws into you! What do you do?" would work well. But, we're playing 5e with the common house rule of monsters' attack rolls changed to players' defense rolls. Maybe the overloaded term "DC" is the problem, I could call it something else...)</blockquote>\n<br/>If I was rolling dice for the monsters, I could say: "She's trying to sink her claws into you, lose 5 HP! What do you do?"<br/><br/>Their own action wouldn't be interrupted by the die rolling or by trying to find out what kind of die roll I'm asking for, a dex save, a defense roll or something else.<br/><br/>Yeah I dunno.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461678/#Comment_461678" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T19:21:19+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  7:21PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must say that I am intrigued by the concept of players rolling save vs. Cuts and Bites or something like that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461680/#Comment_461680" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T19:36:54+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  7:36PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2017 8:23PM by Airk.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad to see this thread, because I saw you mentioning this in the other one and wanted to question it, but didn't want to derail.<br/><br/>I don't really understand the purpose behind switching it around so the players roll everything, unless you believe there is some inherent virtue in the GM not touching the dice.  I guess this probably flows from the various "player facing" games, but in my opinion, "Only the players roll the dice" is only part of what makes a game "player facing" and as such it doesn't really provide that much benefit by itself. <br/><br/>What was the reasoning behind making this change in the first place?  I think that essentially, moving this roll around is just rearranging the deck chairs - it's moving an "interruption" from one location to another, and brings with it the negative effects that you describe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461681/#Comment_461681" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T19:38:23+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  7:38PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the key is to inject some kind of decision into the player side; then it's not just a prompt to roll a die (boring!), but a valid decision point.<br/><br/>If you have a few different options characters can use for their defense, then it becomes interesting.

The problem with this is that the value of the defense is variable: it depends on how likely the opponent is to hit, which is a function of your AC and the enemy's attack bonus. This in turn implies that if characters can trade their defense for doing something else instead, then the characters with high AC will want to defend (more than others, I mean), while those with low AC will want to trade out their less effective defensive actions for whatever other advantage you might be offering. At this point we're basically in min-max territory: if you're planning to not defend in combat, you should sell off your AC - you won't need it if you're not going to defend! And that's probably going to end up in a place that won't work in any sensible way any longer - glass cannon characters become an even more intractable issue.<br/><br/>I "fix" this issue in my homebrew D&amp;D by having both a fixed AC and active defense rolls, which the players can then balance in various situations in different, complex ways, often involving trade-offs of stuff like HP, initiative, attack and defense. That scheme's not relevant to other D&amp;D versions, though.<br/><br/>For 5th edition I don't think that there is an elegant way to achieve defense rolls <i>with</i> genuine choice without rebuilding the system from the ground up. No reason to not have the defense rolls themselves, but allowing characters to sell them for other advantages seems logically impossible within the framework.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461685/#Comment_461685" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T21:18:52+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  9:18PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">@Wilhelm</a>: Yeah, that's cool iofs.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a>: The change came because I got a DM screen (to hide maps) and a larger table so I could no longer roll so the players could see. It was also sort of calling on the spirit of PbtA but I missed the mark there, to say the least. Because in DW, all rolls are made after a player decision. In 'defense roll 5e', these defense rolls are made after a DM decision.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul%26amp">@Paul&amp;</a>;Eero: There are choices. But once this DC is thrown out there, that's not a window to make choices, that's a purely mechanical task. There's an opportunity for describing / fluffing those mechanics, which I kinda want to open up, but not a opportunity to make mechanical choices then.<br/><br/>Here's the flow. Let's say the player A is portraying Amri the wild fighter, and they are fightning an NPC, the beautiful, raven-tressed grue, Maureen, in m\xeal\xe9e.<br/><br/>1. [] Window for Amri's action. They could dodge (advantage on defense roll), hide, disengage, attack her, climb trees, throw sand etc. They can't both attack and dodge, but even if they do dodge, they'll get a defense roll.<br/>2. Mechanical consequences of player action. Pure book keeping.<br/>3. Window for Maureen's action. She could regenerate if in pitch black, atttack with claw, or bite someone who's already in their claws. Let's say she attacks with claw.<br/>4. So here\u2026 at this point, these things need to happen:<br/>4a The diegetic execution of her ttack needs to be conveyed ('She is lunging at you all hair and wild green eyes, her claws a hurricane of keratine and clotted blood')<br/>4b A roll needs to be made. Here is where I'd say 'DC 16!' as a prompt for that roll.<br/>4c The diegetic effect of her attack needs to be conveyed<br/>4d Hitpoints might need to be decreased. And Amri might become Grappled<br/>GOTO 1 # Amri's next window will be there<br/><br/>So the design constraint is that I can't really change the action economy / amount of actions. But, I can change the order of these points and subpoints, if that makes it better. Just not add more so they can both Dodge and Attack.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461686/#Comment_461686" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T21:40:42+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  9:40PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Black Hack game, and it has players making all rolls, including attack saves from monster attacks on PCs.

I mean, I've seen some GMs complain of the lack of tactical options in the game, saying that all their players do is say "I hit it with my axe", take damage and barely move the entire combat. In my case I use plenty the phrase we talked in the other thread: "how exactly do you do it?" (said more like "great, tell me more about it!") which makes each attack/defense description more interesting and makes the combat more dramatic. Players description there actually count as tactical choices.<br/><br/>But then I found out my group of players actually didn't knew much about the actual combat rules, despite I had explained a few times to them and showed through the NPC how could these be used. And it's not like they don't read the book, some of them are hardcore min-maxers and love searching for all the stuf they can make their PCs do... except for the actual combat rules. <br/><br/>After I inserted a brief training combat RP scene and handed them a card with the combat rules, things went even better. I mean, making the players describe their actions is usually enough, but helping them achieve system mastery even on a small degree makes the game even more interesting. If anything what I have somewhat cut from the exchange has been to ask them for their AC after I make an attack roll - I have it written on my DM screen along with their passive perception, so I just roll the attack, add bonuses, compare it to their AC and narrate the consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461691/#Comment_461691" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T05:44:27+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  5:44AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I heard about such groups too but I haven't had those problems at all; this is unrelated to that.

However\u2026<br/><br/>A: 'She lunges at you in a storm of claws, taking eight HP from you. What do you do?' still interrupts the player's work by making them update their HP counter. It's not choice-driven at all, but it's still book-keeping.<br/><br/>B: There are still situations in this window where the players do have to roll, like saves and contests. That can be house ruled away, but,<br/><br/>C: It's really nice to not have to roll and it's physically harder for us to see if I as DM roll.<br/><br/><br/>So what I'm thinking is that I can refactor it a bit; move some action windows around so their next mechanical choice comes closer to their defense narration. They can dodge, spending their next action in advance in order to get advantage on defending. (This buffs dodge (RAW you have to decide in advance), since they don't have to guess in advance whether or not they'll be attacked, but probably not enough for it to\u2026 for it to be ever used at all, actuallly.

Your die roll is only there to see if the consequence happens or not, and how firmly.   The "What do you do?" part, to me, happens on the player's turn.   D&amp;D doesn't really give you options for avoiding this without adding some sort of like, "reaction" and that involves in this case, building an entire subsystem like Eero suggests.   I've heard people talk about giving PCs a "reaction" type action on saving thows - it works like:<br/><br/>GM: "Joana, Thommen, you're advancing down the hall when you step on something and hear a 'click'. You've got a split second to react, what do you?"<br/>J: "I throw myself forward and tumble out of the way!"<br/>T: "I brace myself and ready my shield."<br/><br/>And then, depending on what sort of something we're dealing with, Joana might roll a dex save, and Thommen might roll a con or strength save, but it depends on what the something is - if it's a pit trap, Joana gets a dex save, while Thommen just falls in the pit.  If it's a bunch of rocks falling from the ceiling all along the corridor, Thommen might get that Str/Con save to block them with his shield while Joana gets no roll because she hasn't gotten out of the way of the rocks.  <br/><br/>I can't think of a good way to implement this for combat though.  D&amp;D just fundamentally doesn't work that way. =/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461702/#Comment_461702" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T16:12:29+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  4:12PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We were on the same page already re choice windows vs pure consequence "windows" (not really windows)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461703/#Comment_461703" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T16:13:05+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  4:13PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GM: "Joana, Thommen, you're advancing down the hall when three goblins jump out, screaming BREEYARK and poking at you with spears!

There's actually a special action you need to take to get away from melee.  I mean, you can rule that the monster pursues them, but if that's the case, there's very little reason for most characters to not just fall back all the time, which has the net result of "Move back a little bit, which usually doesn't matter, for advantage on all your defense rolls"? <br/><br/>The idea might be sound, but it's going back to what Eero said, where it's really difficult to come up with good options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461718/#Comment_461718" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T19:10:05+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  7:10PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2017 7:32PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes: the monster should get a "free move" to follow you, if it wants to. Otherwise, as you say, it could take the place of another combat maneuver.<br/><br/>You could make it more punishing if you want - include the option of falling prone, or say that it grants advantage to the monster for its next turn. (It gets "momentum".) Or disadvantage for your next turn (you lose "momentum").<br/><br/>If you remove the advantage from "fall back", then it's just a standard defense roll. That would work fine!<br/><br/>However, I wonder what kind of fights you're having if "falling back" isn't some kind of drawback. If you're indoors, eventually you'll have your back against a wall, or leave the radius of torches and have to fight in the dark. If you're outdoors, you could be separated from your companions, flanked, surrounded, or pushed off a cliff (or into some other environmental hazard).<br/><br/>Maybe fighting in more interesting environments would be enough to make it work!<br/><br/>(Again, take this with a grain of salt, since I've never played 5e.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461719/#Comment_461719" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T19:14:27+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  7:14PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your example works, Paul, because you're still making the defense roll in each case, so the AC remains relevant. I would still be careful about the "I grit my teeth" option, because that's where the AC dumping comes into play if it does: a player chooses to forego defense both in their character build and in their tactics, and instead optimizes their damage output (or fleeing capacity, whatever), leading to more lop-sided character concerns. The double damage is harsh in this particular example, which I like; it makes that option more of something you'd do with a very good AC rather than something you'd choose because you feel you're going to fail the defense anyway.<br/><br/>The reason why I personally forwent this strategy when thinking about this yesterday, however, is that now you're extending the length of each combat action to double size: instead of the attacker choosing to attack and [somebody] rolling to resolve the attack, you're having the attacker choose their attack, the defender choose their defense, and only then resolving the event. This means that each combat includes double the amount of decision-making points as before. Is this really a viable strategic direction to take in hacking the system?<br/><br/>(This problem obviously is not a problem for Sandra's original conceit of having PCs roll defense rolls instead of monster attack rolls - that alone does not add steps, it just moves the dice-rolling around.)<br/><br/>Having abandoned the idea that every defender gets a little "defender turn" every time they are attacked, I determined that if I want to keep the amount of decision-making roughly similar to the standard rules, the "defensive choices" need to essentially occur as part of or instead of normal character actions. Here I got stuck with the paradox I mentioned earlier: if we couple a character's actions with their defense (instead of having characters automatically defend as in orthodox D&amp;D), then AC becomes a much more volatile resource, capable of being dump-statted, which may be undesirable for many purposes.<br/><br/>For the sake of the exercise, though, here's how I would do this if I had to. This starts getting pretty far away from 5th edition D&amp;D, though:<br/><br/>Monsters always act first during a combat round, there's a "monster phase" during which the GM challenges the players with the threatening monsters. When a monster attacks a character it "sticks on" to the character, engaging them, but does not inflict their attack effects yet. If a monster is still engaging a character at the end of a combat round, they automatically deal their damage to the target. Essentially, there are two monster phases in each combat round, the "monster move phase" and the "monster damage phase", with the PC action turns sandwiched in between.<br/><br/>PCs, on the other hand, can "shut down" monsters by successfully attacking them; a character can retreat from engagement with a shut down monster, avoiding their attack for this round. Only monsters that have not been shaken away and shut down in this way actually get to inflict their damage at the end of the round.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a PC can choose to "dodge", making a defense roll to avoid all monsters stuck to them this round at the expense of doing anything useful. This works by rolling defense against every monster sticking to you individually, in the order you choose (or an order suggested by the fictional fight choreography, whatever); you get to continue dodging as long as you succeed, but if you miss on one monster, that's it - the rest are still stuck on you.<br/><br/>If a character succeeds in dodging every monster assaulting them, they get to "riposte", taking a normal attack on top of their dodging. This is a reward for the character who's AC is not being completely overwhelmed by the enemy.<br/><br/>What this system achieves is that monsters do not cause attack sequences at all during the combat round, which should help keep the handling time down. Players get the same amount of decision points they do in the orthodox rules, except now they need to make a stark choice between defense and attack. Monsters feel much more like an environmental puzzle than active characters that the GM is running against you. The tactical value of AC, and the character build logic, still goes completely haywire, but it does it in an interesting way that I feel is not necessarily thoroughly unbalanced.<br/><br/>(If you're wondering about the DPS of the combat participants, I don't think it goes too weird here. We're just essentially saying that if you're fighting a monster and miss with your attack, the monster damages you instead. Somebody always gets damaged, either you or your opponent.

I have played ditching initiative and going first with the first player to call their action, then the next and then asking their actions to those players who are still undecided. If everyone has played or if someone missed their attack roll, the monster attacks or does another move. If anybody rolls a fumble then either the monster makes an area attack or something happens that affects everyone and the cycle starts over again.<br/><br/>At least that's how I understood DW and PbtA games are supposed to be played. Over this you can throw all kinds of PC skills, items, special abilities, etc. and it will work, as long as we determine from the start that nothing is infallible.<br/><br/>But to play D&amp;D this way that means rewriting the game completely, it's almost a different kind of fun. My game works this way and it usually goes wicked fast compared to D&amp;D. I wouldn't say there's less tactical thinking because of this. There is, but since everything goes more cinematic, a lot of the smallest tactical choices get lost. Players have to think faster, but they can still play each at their pace since if they have no idea about what to do, the next player that does can act and leave the previous some time to think. The GM just needs to go around the table in the same order until everyone has acted.<br/><br/>There are times when it makes sense for a player to do more things in their turn or roll the dice a lot; it's okay: the more they roll, the higher the chances for the monster to make a move if they fail.

"The goblin swings her mace at you, whistling toothily to herself. Go ahead and roll her attack for me at +4. It hits? That's 1d6+2 slashing damage as the mace bounces off your skull, mate." This means you don't need to invent and balance a replacement for the AC subsystem; you don't even have to explain anything, as it's just the rules as is but with a different person executing them.<br/><br/>This doesn't particularly achieve your other goal of encouraging off-menu choices, but I don't think changing AC to a Defence Saving Throw achieves this either. Saving Throws are obligatory: both within the D&amp;D rules and within the fiction, because obviously players will always choose to defend themselves from being attacked so long as that action is free. <br/><br/>In the rules as is, monsters follow exactly the same rules as characters on their turns. After introducing Defence Saves - and assuming that players are still using Attack actions to meet AC instead of the monsters rolling Defence Saves against the players on the players' turns - I would be worried that the monsters will stop feeling like independent entities and more like static obstacles.<br/><br/>Obviously NPCs and monsters *are* second-class citizens in a D&amp;D game, but one of the distinguishing features of D&amp;D (for me) is its fundamental conception of the world and creatures in the game as pre-existing, independent from the players and their actions, although they might be affected by them. They don't just exist to serve the players' story. Dungeon World makes a (well deserved) attack on that core idea, but I think many of those drawn to D&amp;D enjoy exploring a pre-existing world and its denizens - it's a sort-of proactive non-creativity.<br/><br/>In the 5E rules as is, PCs are supposed to respond to being attacked by choosing an appropriate action when the initiative order comes back to them. I find my players will generally remember who has attacked them and aim to take revenge on that monster during their next turn. But even though I use a variety of techniques to keep combat fast moving (e.g. PCs lose their turns if they don't declare an action within six seconds) there is still quite a big table-time gap between between the monster attack and the player action, which in-fiction are theoretically instantaneous. Now I come to think about it this has a *really* unnatural feeling to it. I've always just accepted this as a consequence of the rounds/turn system...<br/><br/>(I know I'm over-explaining D&amp;D rules, but writing them out is part of my thinking process and I've just left them in to help people who don't know D&amp;D follow.)<br/><br/>I can think of a number of exceptions to this delaying effect, most of which are reactions (in the technical sense of an extra action you can take once per round, interrupting someone else's turn):<br/><br/>1) The Rogue has Uncanny Dodge staring at 5th level, which means they can burn their reaction to halve the damage of a hit against them. (Rangers can also gain this at 15th level.)<br/><br/>2) From 3rd level, the Monk can catch or deflect missiles as a reaction. (I've seen lots of RPing milage wrung from this feature.)<br/><br/>3) Fighters and Rangers have various optional defence-related features or manoeuvres, which mostly boil down to:<br/>3a) use your reaction to reduce damage<br/>3b) use your reaction to make an extra attack if an opponent misses you<br/>3c) increase AC in certain circumstances<br/><br/>4) Barbarians' AC changes when they are raging. They can also choose to attack with advantage in exchange for giving anyone who attacks them advantage until their next turn.<br/><br/>5) Spellcasters have recourse to a number of warding/protection/shielding/AC increasing spells. Most of these aren't cast as reactions (Shield being a notable exception) but they do generally require the player to pay attention to monster actions in order to make sure the effects are applied. The Dodge action has a similar effect, in that it burns the PC's turn in exchange for an effectively passive defensive bonus.<br/><br/>Perhaps the reaction mechanic is the key to closing the attack-defence/revenge gap in round-based combat?<br/><br/>The simplest iteration of this idea goes, "The goblin swings her sword down on you. You're about to be hit for 5 slashing damage... unless you want to take a reaction?" This phrasing implies a) that the PC has the option to take an action right now b) that there is real potential to avoid this negative consequence and c) specifies that the mechanical cost of trying this is that you've used your reaction slot for the round so can't take an opportunity attack etc.<br/><br/>If the players don't have a relevant reaction listed on their character sheet, then their only option is to go off menu - and we've given them an incentive to do this. "I stoop down and throw some sand up into the goblin's face."<br/><br/>"Great, I'll reroll her attack as you've imposed disadvantage." So effectively, we've allowed the PC to use the Dodge action in the reaction slot. "The goblin's sword misses you entirely as she spits sand out of her mouth."<br/><br/>Off menu damage reduction or riposting is harder to adjudicate, as we don't want to invalidate any defensive character features that people might have chosen. I suppose with player agreement it would be fine: you could declare that Riposte (make a return attack) and Parry (reduce damage by 1d8+Dex) are defensive reactions available to everyone from the off, and let people select their character's features accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461866/#Comment_461866" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-11T04:44:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2017  4:44AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of great points and it eases my mind.

Also, the players now roll encounter checks, and I've changed those from 17+ to get an encounter to 5+ to avoid an encounter. In general I like the players to wish for the dice they roll to be high. (+ you can give them adv &amp; disadv on encounter checks)<br/><br/>But, even the 'roll high is good'-rule has had an exception since the beginning. I usually use static damage if it's available, but when the monster critted (even when I was rolling the attacks) or the characters took falling damage, I would have them roll it. The first couple of times it felt really weird to me to say 'take 2d6+7 damage' but I've gotten used to it.<br/><br/>Interestingly, last time I ran, it was with a new group. And I was doing all of this without batting an eye, calling for armor saves, calling for encounter checks, having them roll their own damage etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461875/#Comment_461875" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-11T15:53:05+00:00" title="April 11, 2017  3:53PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Lots of great points and it eases my mind.

Something that's used for rolling defense <i>only</i> and not confused with save DCs or player-initiated skill DCs.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's something I'm really curious about -- how transparent are these DCs to the players, how easy is it for you as the GM to be consistent about assigning those DCs, and how much time/mental effort are you actually saving by doing it this way?<br/><br/>The first one I ask because as a player, the GM describing a situation and asking what I do in response usually makes me want to know more about the specific mechanics I'm going to have to engage with: I don't want to say "I throw sand in her eyes!" if that's super-hard to do and "I nimbly dodge out of the way" is super-easy, for example. If I can't work that out on my own, I'm going to feel obligated to ask, and that makes me worried that I'm breaking the flow of the game and/or taking too much time.<br/><br/>The second one I ask because as a GM, I get skittish about how consistent I can be with moment-to-moment difficulty assessments, and I don't want to be constantly moving the goalposts on the players, even unintentionally. Do you have a system for what the DCs are? Does it matter what kind of armor the PC is wearing, or is that now purely a cosmetic choice for them?<br/><br/>The last question's just pure laziness on my part: especially with a lot of players to get through in each round, I don't want to turn every action the NPCs take into a whole negotiated exchange with the targeted player ("What do you do? That's going to be DC15, roll it. 14? Okay, this happens.") if there's a faster and easier way of getting through my part of the round. I've got plenty of stuff on my plate already as a GM, I don't know that I want to ladle on a double-helping of attention to something like a combat round if it's not going to be incredibly important and cool.<br/><br/><br/>(I should say that one thing I find appealing about the idea of defense rolls is that it really sells the basic notion of "oh my god monsters are going to wreck your face, this is a dangerous world." If every attack on you provokes a decision about what you're going to do about it, you feel constantly harried by your attackers in a way that "the kobold swings...and hits your AC, take 4 damage" never will.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461916/#Comment_461916" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T05:59:21+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  5:59AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2017 6:56AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ugh, Vanilla ate my post. Because I used an emoji for your name which I can't really spell out because I'm not sure if the image is supposed to be part of the name or not.<br/><br/>The defense roll DC:s come from the monster's to hit bonus + ten. So if the goblin has +4 I just read the plus as a 1 and see "14". DC:s for hiding from someone or grappling with them are similarly mechanically derived from their stat block.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that straight-forward "create an advantage" situations like sand-throwing I'd just grant, if they spent their full action. But, maybe my players are shaking their heads if reading this, thinking "No, she doesn't just grant things" because MTP questions are perceived differently from both sides of the screen.<br/><br/>When we played Diaspora, I was eager for us to take turns GM:ing and I kind of tossed my friend in the deep end ("You GM next time!") without having the sort of Fate (Diaspora uses Fate) nerdery I'd acquired from reading the books over and over and listening to podcasts, actual play and reading forums. (I sort of trusted the book to be evident enough, but... since the game is so different, I'm not sure about that.) In the game, I got into an arena fight with a large crowd and I spent actions, effort and a successful roll (it wasn't just a tie to "Boost", it was a big success) to get the crowd on my side as an aspect. But he quickly removed it without any expenditure on my NPC opponent's part (to me, it felt like it was just "They're booing you now" and he removed the aspect). I went online to complain to find sympathy (as one does) but got none, people were like "Naw, it's reasonable that the crowd could turn on you, advantages are transient" etc. It kind of soured me on the whole thing. Later, Fate Core codified the "Create an Advantage"-action.<br/><br/><br/>But that's beside the point, which was, if I could be so easily soured; how many times haven't my players been? Hard to tell. I do try my best to recognize the expenditure of a full action in 5e combat as a very significant payment.<br/><br/><br/>For more off-the-menu skill usages, if I can come up with a good success-at-a-cost, I usually do what I call a "12/20". I state three outcomes, one bad, one success-at-a-cost, one good. Then it's DC 12 to get the middle one but if you manage a DC 20 you get the best one. But, I'm a big fan of just the old binary pass/fail too, in which case I use 15 unless the prep says otherwise, which it often enough does (things like locks in dungeons are often statted, and of course NPCs). Binary pass/fail has a lot of legs in a time-critical, fine-grained game like 5e is, there's usually no need to overthink it with partial outcomes. Success already has the cost that you spent your action on it which pretty much always has consequences, and failure has that cost too but adds "not getting what you wanted" on top of that.<br/><br/>Skill rolls are pretty rare though because our fights are over so quickly and outside of fighting I much more often just charge a time cost, which leads to encounter checks. "That'll take about 20 minutes, do you do it?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461920/#Comment_461920" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T07:06:05+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  7:06AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2017 7:08AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm intrigued by encounter checks. Does that work like a random encounter table or is it more of an in-fiction thing?</blockquote>\nYeah, here is how it works:<br/><br/>You know how in D&amp;D, many dungeons and wild places have a location-specific rule that you, every <i>X</i> time span, roll a d<i>Y</i> and if you get a <i>Z</i> result, then you got to the random encounter table and roll on it with some die or combination of die types (Curse of Strahd uses a d8+d12).<br/><br/>In my game from the beginning I made this a very explicit, overt mechanic, making a big show of making these rolls. It worked really well but after a while, I switched it to putting these rolls in the players hands, and that was even better. (I still have the table itself behind the screen but we talk explicitly about some rolls that have already come up "Is 12 the wolves?" "No, the wolves are on 13".)<br/><br/>What I also do is if <em>Z</em> is high, I always switch it to low. I want the players to want to roll high. And if d<em>Y</em> isn't a d20, sometimes I change it to that. Like if it's "1/6" I might go to having the party roll a d20, on a 5+ there's no encounter. I don't always change it to a d20 but I do always make it so that it's "roll high to avoid encounter". I'm ok with the frequency being low because we make a <em>lot</em> of these checks, sometimes rolling handfuls of dice for a long journey or stressful hours in a fortified corner.<br/><br/>And I'm open about the time span, which varies from place to place, and the numbers involved. "OK, now that you've left the road, the numbers change to..."<br/><br/>So it's encounter table based more than in-fiction based.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461921/#Comment_461921" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T07:10:40+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  7:10AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my latest con game, which used homemade tables, I used a d20 and it was 5+ to avoid an encounter, and then I used the first four numbers to find an entry on my shorter (eight entry) table, alternating between the first half and the second half on that table.

I gave it a shot. First session is May 12th but probably there won't be any fights then.<br/>So we'll see later. ABT\u2014always be testing.<br/><br/><b>Three small changes from RAW</b><br/>1. I changed it so you can perform the dodge action, an action which already existed in the RAW, "in advance", "in response" to being attacked. That's the only "defensive option" I added. But then that costs you your turn for that round, basically you "jump the queue" if you want to dodge. If you previously have diegetically maneuvered the fictional positioning of elements in the SIS to get advantage on defending (or use spells for it), you don't have to dodge, you already have advantage. That's a second, and open ended, defensive option.<br/><br/>2. I changed it so that if you are attacked, it becomes your turn right afterwards, unless you've already taken a turn this round. You jump the queue \u2014 the person who attacked you still goes, but then you can go right away. <b>The point of this is queue jumping is to (more often) consolidate the response windows.</b> You get to defend, then you get to do something.<br/>I'll add a key phrase "While you're busy with..." if you're attacked while you've already spent your action for the round.<br/><br/>3. (Not related to the question of defensive options.) As per the DMG, I use the static list "initiative score" option instead of rolling for initiative. But I've also added that whoever diegetically initiates force jumps to the top of the list. This is something I had already been doing for years, but instead of jumping to the top of the list, I'd have the list just start with them and everyone above them just skipped that turn. So my new approach makes it <i>less</i> different from the RAW than I had already been doing.<br/><br/><b>Elegant to play?</b><br/>Huh... it does look pretty clumsy. I want to test it.<br/><br/><b>Not unbalanced?</b><br/>It's the same action econ as RAW but with Dodge action buffed \u2014 an action that has never, ever been used for almost three years of play, and it still, post-buff, looks pretty weak. But hopefully strong enough to be used sometimes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[5e] Defense rolls, or AC?

trilemma as far as it can go. I especially like the initiative hijinks - it's more exciting, realistic and does help with handling time by effectively following up the player's defensive choice with the rest of their turn, if any.<br/><br/>The interesting question is whether "aborting to defend" is worth it for the defender, and when. Because it essentially gives you a second defense roll (a bonus die to defend), its usefulness is at its highest when enemies have a roughly 50/50 chance of hitting, and the consequences of a hit are worse than the gain you would have from attacking yourself (or whatever it would be that you'd do on your turn).<br/><br/>Presumably character with heavy armor won't be dodging, because they're relying on succeeding on a single die. Likewise character who will get hit anyway due to low AC won't bother - they'll miss the defense roll on two dice same as one, so better just take it and try to get something useful done on their own action. And of course characters who expect to end the fight quickly, or otherwise have important actions to take, won't want to lose their action to dodge.<br/><br/>I agree that this Dodge is still not too strong, and that canonical texts generally make dodging pretty weak (basically because they want you to take your attacks and finish the combat instead of dodging back and forth). Seems very worthwhile to try this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462908/#Comment_462908" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T11:23:33+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 11:23AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2017 11:27AM by 2097.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks\u2665!<br/><br/>Remember that when you're fighting against rogues it's pretty good to get advantage easily, it can help against their sneak bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462909/#Comment_462909" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T11:44:49+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 11:44AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that my intuition is telling me is that it'd be nice if you could benefit from the dodge advantage against multiple enemies per round. I suppose that if the GM is using group initiative for the monsters then this wouldn't be difficult to implement, because presumably every monster that's going to attack you is going to do it simultaneously in the turn order.<br/><br/>It just feels right that a full defense should help against getting ganged up. If the bonus doesn't carry over after the first attack, its effect is negligible in any situation where the danger comes from multiple attacks rather than just one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462910/#Comment_462910" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T12:17:53+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 12:17PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2017 12:19PM by 2097.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't worry, that's already there in the RAW, Eero.

Then their windows won't get consolidated that round. One will be able to fight back first, then the other. See, exceptions are natural consequences of the system, I like that.<br/><br/>So instead of making a rule "the windows are consolidated" (like arguably Kutulu and PbtA does), I've found a rule that has the consequence of <i>usually</i> consolidating the windows but still allowing for corner cases and still feeling enough like 5e to me. Haven't been this happy about a design in a long time.

I asked them afterwards and they claimed to be indifferent to the change, but when we went back to the vanilla system the next week they seemed less stung by being attacked than they had when they were actively rolling defence. So I think it did make them more enguaged in the encounter, they just didn't realise it.<br/><br/>As a GM, I loved using DSs because it meant I had less dice to manage. There were sixteen vampire-bit satyr in this particular encounter and it would have been a pain to roll for them all. All I had to do was tell the players who was being attacked, and then they did the admin bits simultaneously while I took a moment to get ready for the next round.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'm totally sold on DSs and will be using them in the future!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463925/#Comment_463925" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T16:24:38+00:00" title="June 13, 2017  4:24PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been using them pretty comfortably for about a year.
