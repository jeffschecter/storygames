Let say you going to play with strangers, you had no or little OOC communication with before and during the game. This situation is a bit more common at larps then at tabletop, but say at you end up at a Con playing with people you don't know.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I faced the situation, I found that it changed the immersion a lot. I would like to hear you thought on it and if the situation could be used for some interesting effects. because there is really a bunch of things that makes things a lot diffrent then from the usual situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off there no time to build any OOC trust to the players as persons. You can perhaps trust the situation, and that safe words and OOC communication will be respected but you have no personal realtionship of trust with the player behind the characters you meet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly you is placed in a situation where you don't see the player behind the character. If you play with people you know whos personalities you know, you can see what in play is their real personalty bleeding though and whats the character. When you have no idea who the player behind the character is you have to accept all that you see as probably a part of the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example when you shy friend play a knight, and the knight seems slightly shy you know that probably isn't a part of how you friend intend the character is going to come through. If a stranger is playing the shy knight, you have no idea is the shy part belongs to the character or not, and you need to accept exactly what you see and what is played as it is,<br/>\nThe same thing is true for you. The players around you will react to exactly the way the play you character.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, playing immersionist play styles with strangers have made some really really powerful games. Both because you forced to take that leap of faith and just trust the other players, and because you can reach more of an 360 degrees illusion, because you need to react to everything the other players do and show. Not just what they intend to be a part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anyone here that shared that experience and might have some awesome thoughts how this situation can be used?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345362/#Comment_345362" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-09T14:33:11+00:00" title="October  9, 2011  2:33PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2011 2:36PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basic trust exist between people; we try to get along. So we may count on that trust to bring us there, together; that fabled place where we turn each other into masters of illusions; where I believe in your character, and you in mine, and we in our own.<br/><br/>I've played with hundreds of strangers at conventions, and have had great experiences. Never once has the trust between us as players been broken. I believe that is a beautiful thing, and I cherish it.<br/><br/>It is important for our ability to gather and have fun with role-playing games at conventions, and it is a great basis for profound and unfettered character-work. As we do not know each other, we take it for granted that <i>we are gathered to play</i>. The game-play is our common denominator, so we put all our energy into it, with less interruptions than we may do with friends. Any game is better for a little extra devotion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345416/#Comment_345416" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T09:35:46+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  9:35AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leap of faith.
