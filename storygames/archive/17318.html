Boy scouts? It's a pretty ordinary thing for children to play outside, and in my experience both as a child and an adult they're happy to have an adult around explaining and adjudicating the rules of a more complex game. There are dozens of variants of hide and seek that you could use, for example.<br/><br/>The games I liked best at that age and like still are about perception, reflexes, coordination and social skills more than raw strength or endurance. (This is significant in that the simplest children's games are all about raw endurance and sprinting - running around after each other in different variants, basically.) I would go into the specifics, but I really don't know about what games are common to your locality at all. Finnish yard games probably wouldn't be any good here. Frisbee golf is probably familiar, maybe that'd work?<br/><br/>There are some yard games that have withstood the test of time as adult pre-occupations as well. I'm thinking of things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petanque" rel="nofollow">p\xe9tanque</a>, although again the specific games I personally like best like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyykk%C3%A4" rel="nofollow">"kyykk\xe4"</a> are regional and probably not familiar to you. If I were doing the sort of thing you've got here, I well might try to pick some traditional semi-serious game like this that adults can play, too. My extended family, for example, will happily play appropriately adult outdoors games with children, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392576/#Comment_392576" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T19:05:12+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  7:05PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, kyykk\xe4 sounds like a really interesting game.

You select a seeker, and then one of the other players kicks down on the board so that the sticks scatter in all directions. The seeker has to collect all sticks back on top of the board (and board back on the pivot point) before they can go seek the other players. Should the seeker find somebody, they race back to the board; if the seeker gets there first, the other player is captured, but if the other gets to the board first, they can kick the sticks again and everybody captured so far is freed to seek a new hiding place. The game ends when the seeker has managed to capture everyone, at which point the first captive becomes the new seeker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392601/#Comment_392601" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T01:58:06+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  1:58AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2012 1:59AM by The_Magus.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is one hell of a tough design brief.  11year old girls are a tricky bunch as they oscillate between wanting to act older and playing with dolls and unicorns.  I'd ask the girl whose birthday it is what she wants and also check out with her parents.<br/><br/>I like the idea of using cameras to tell a story.

You could give them some comics and books and have them cut out pictures to tell a story of strange creatures they have seen in the park.  Alternatively, still using the camera idea, you could have some celebrity magazines and they could be paparazzi and journalists writing stories.

For adults this sort of stuff is a refreshing change of pace, but schoolkids get to do pictorial collage assignments in school, too. If I were going for storytelling, I'd try for something more immediate.<br/><br/>The camera is a pretty good tool for game design for this age group. An idea that occurs is that you could stage a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_hunt_%28game%29" rel="nofollow">treasure hunt</a> with a twist where the hunters are trying to capture the target in question on camera. Of course a traditional treasure hunt is cool, too.<br/><br/>Of course a gamer can't write the above without also suggesting that perhaps the players should be trying to capture each other on camera. Two teams, the team that first captures everybody on the other team wins. Sort of like laser tag, but less martial. Sounds like potentially fun, and so simple that I can't be the first person ever to think of that.<br/><br/>Going back to Werewolf, you could rely on a boardgame or similar here. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_%28game%29" rel="nofollow">Twister</a> and other party games are a natural fit. Or just create a new game in that cachet, it's an interesting design space. Not that tweens would appreciate being playtesters for something untested.<br/><br/>Do you have any idea of how sporty vs. brainy these kids (particularly the birthday girl) are? Preadolescents already have individual preferences and capabilities, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392605/#Comment_392605" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T02:58:43+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  2:58AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about you film yourself or in character around the park.<br/>Made Professor who has hidden some device in the park to travel between worlds? <br/>They have to follow through the video the path you took through park.<br/>Best I can think for this type idea                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392616/#Comment_392616" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T08:23:59+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  8:23AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the responses, everyone!<br/><br/>At least two of the girls are really into "handcrafts" type things, but I don't know if they all are.<br/><br/>One idea I'm really leaning towards is having them make a movie "on location", by filming a series of brief scenes.

(Or last scene filmed, they could be out of order.)<br/><br/>b) The "big reveal" of the story only happens once you PLAY the scenes IN ORDER (after they've finished filming).<br/><br/>I guess I'm thinking of making a simpler version of something like the film "Memento".

I could see something simple where characters are indicated by funky hats, for example, and every player has a clear goal in the fiction. The GM could be "acting police", making sure everybody stays in character (and obviously the characters should be clear enough so the players understand what is in character for them).<br/><br/>Your idea of a plot-oriented game, Paul, feels to me a bit too abstract for 11-year olds. Children at that age rarely focus enough of abstract dramatic thinking like expectations; they enjoy stories more for immediate substance (how very funny this thing here is, how very evil this other thing is, how very nice, beautiful, whatever). An adult enjoys a surprising story like you suggest generally better because they see stories in terms of expectations anyway: why does this character act like that, I hope this character will have a happy ending, and so on. If you don't have expectations or your expectations are weak, then the concept of narrative surprise is not as important for you.<br/><br/>If I were doing a story game for this sort of thing (and you notice how it's just about the last thing I'm suggesting), I'd go for something that focuses on the simple basic cornerstones of story-like communication. For example, the game could be something where players first establish characters and then judge them on simple moral criteria... ah, <i>The Dance and the Dawn</i> could work at that age now that I think of it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392671/#Comment_392671" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T00:25:37+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 12:25AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Great stuff.

Here's my play report which has what I posted earlier and more, including pics from the event...<br/><br/><a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/75807.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/75807.html</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lizhenry/sets/72157617948987454/with/3509413484/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/lizhenry/sets/72157617948987454/with/3509413484/</a>\n<blockquote>The basic plot was that the royals were stopping to rest at the druids' sanctuary in the woods for the night while on a secret mission. The bandits planned to kidnap the regent's daughter. They would eventually find that they were on the same side, and support the druid's ritual that would find the queen's true heir. However, a fae creature had stolen the druids' chalice and wand that would be needed. So there would be fighting, negotiation, and finding clues leading to two items hidden in the woods. Liz had prepared two puzzles written on mock scrolls, which I hung in plain sight. When solved, the puzzles gave a clue to the location of the hidden item near where the scroll was hung. <br/><br/>By design, the plot was all contained in the characters themselves and the clues. The adult roles were all supporting. <br/><br/>The rules were simple. I went over the Scandanavian traditions of "cut" and "break" -- meaning "emergency - stop the larp" and "give me a minute."  Combat was done using the toy weapons that the birthday girl had mostly supplied, which were not very real but were also mostly not safety-padded in the manner of boffer larps.  We told the kids to play-fight and not hurt each other, which was fine for them.  In combat, hits to the limb disable that limb, while hits to the body incapacitate. The magical characters (the witch and the druids) had unlimited healing, taking to the count of ten for each wound. There was to be no killing. Also, I said that magical characters could give instructions if they declared a power or hit you with a spell packet. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392672/#Comment_392672" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T00:41:12+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 12:41AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!
