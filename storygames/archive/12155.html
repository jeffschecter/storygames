That is, characters don't get the benefits of an extended or short rest from just spending time doing nothing.  Instead, certain story related moments would have to occur instead.<br/><br/>This would suit a non-dungeon crawl type campaign better, where larger periods of time might pass between fights.  It also solves the problem of the 5 minute adventuring day in those kinds of campaigns.<br/><br/>Each character would have to have some sort of key that needs to get played before they trigger a short rest.  This would be something about the character.  Like "a lady in every port" or "gets advice without asking for it" or whatever else the player thinks is important about their character in a more minor way.  A given character might have 4 or 5 of these.  Probably can't use the same one twice before all are used-- or maybe three times.  And probably you have to remove one and replace it with a new one every time you level (or every second level, depending on the pacing of the campaign).<br/><br/>If the player wanted their character to have a short rest, they'd have to seek out a scene where one of their keys gets played.  One character might have "on the run from the law" and the player decides to trigger that, so he has his character go about his operations and gets spotted by an informant, a bounty hunter, etc., that brings a bit of heat down or in some way demonstrates to all the rest of the people at the table what his character is about.<br/><br/>That's the key here.  That it's about demonstrating to the rest of the players the things that make the characters who they are.<br/><br/>It will also select out uninteresting characters that don't have these kind of keys because they'll have a harder and harder time surviving if they don't have scenes of characterization to refresh their abilities.  Like a TV show or Movie, a less developed character is often more likely to die.<br/><br/>Extended rests will be at key plot points.  Moving forward on whatever is the actual goal of the campaign.  I'm generally a player-agency type fellow, so if I was running this, I'd be fairly generous as to when this happens.<br/><br/>All characters, both PCs and NPCs, would be available to interact with to play these keys.  This should help both in the cementing and fleshing out of PC-PC relationships (whether they be friendship, enmity or something romantic, or complicated) as well as the formation of ties with NPCs.  Purely from a game perspective, an NPC that your character can go to to play one of those keys is a valuable resource.<br/><br/>So an example:<br/><br/>Wintyr the Drow Warlock has the following:<br/>-- "I only made the pact because I had no choice."<br/>-- "Not one of those 'safe' Drow..."<br/>-- "Wants someone to be close to."<br/>-- "Cold as winter"<br/><br/>So Wintyr is only going to get a short rest when she can express or have revealed something about her past and why she took a warlock's pact.  Or when she demonstrates that she's not a Drow who is ashamed of her people and that she hasn't become "domesticated."  The last two will create a contradictory tension where she seeks out companionship and rejects it and becomes distant and emotionally closed.  As they will happen an equal amount, it should give a good sense that she's still figuring out how to relate to other people outside of Drow culture.<br/><br/>So throughout the first level, she both seeks the attention and rebuffs the advances of the half-elf bard PC.  She kills prisoners and is merciless despite her party's shock at her actions.  She tells a bit about how she became a warlock in a conversation with an NPC seeking to hire the party.  And a few other things.<br/><br/>Wintyr levels up and her player decides that the bard is starting to actually make a connection with her.  So she loses "Cold as winter" and gets "I'll make him mine."<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272453/#Comment_272453" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T00:06:16+00:00" title="May 22, 2010 12:06AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: frozenwastes</cite>It will also select out uninteresting characters that don't have these kind of keys because they'll have a harder and harder time surviving if they don't have scenes of characterization to refresh their abilities.</blockquote>\nI haven't played 4th edition -- maybe resting up is less important than in previous editions -- but this seems incredibly unlikely. The reason ties in to I think a general problem with this idea: rests in D&amp;D are both a) necessary and b) occur at very obvious points in the game. I mean the mechanical game. There is usually a very obvious point where the party has to rest, or where a particular character has to rest. Sometimes this is played for tension (do we have time to rest before the next encounter? Is it too dangerous?) but basically, resting happens obviously and it happens all at once.<br/><br/>You can't have one PC who doesn't rest while the other PCs rest. The idea that a PC being more likely to die due to not resting is <i>desireable</i> seems, to me, to fly in the face of party-based adventure play. A party-oriented group of players just won't let that happen.<br/><br/>What does that mean? It means the boring character with the lame key will still go through the motions of coming up with some lame, half-assed scene -- probably one the player themselves has no interest in -- because <i>otherwise they will lose the game.</i> This is not an opt-in scenario, that rewards more interesting characters with a small bonus to encourage roleplay -- you pretty much are going to do it, or you are not going to have fun with the rest of the game. (Oh neat everyone else has their awesome spells and I am throwing darts, again... oh and if any of these monsters hit me I will die.)<br/><br/>Now maybe this is fine, but I think what you are going to end up with is a group that runs through a rote series of isolated vignettes which, while they will establish character, will not necessarily be all that constructive in terms of roleplaying opportunities. <br/><br/>(This was very negative, apologies if my tone seems overbearing, but I think you should look at adding incentives for this sort of play, rather than replacing a core mechanic.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272454/#Comment_272454" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T00:21:02+00:00" title="May 22, 2010 12:21AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2010 12:31AM by frozenwastes.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a perfectly good point and I think I mostly agree.

For example, a first level wizard can always cast at least two spells, you never run out of magic missiles and scorching bursts and the like to cast.  I think this is one of the 4E specific things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis type of mod might require easier encounters as well (or perhaps not as the wizards.com forums are full of DMs having trouble challenging their players) because there's a higher chance of back to back encounters without a short rest than with the normal way of doing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272464/#Comment_272464" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T06:21:53+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  6:21AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if you want to address some of the problems this might create with pacing and spotlight, you might want to make it less individual-PC-focused.<br><br>Keep short rests as is - they're too much a part of the resource management game in 4E to tinker with too much.<br><br>Make extended rests where this stuff happens, and have the "rest keys" be a party thing, not an individual thing. The benefit should not be "don't need to have the rest" but "get out of a later rest free". For example, if you hit 2 party keys during a rest, then you have 2 "rest tokens" that you can spend later for 1 PC to skip a short rest and still get the benefit or shorten an extended rest by 20%. This keeps the resource management game intact, reduces spotlight troubles (the players who are invested in the keys can carry the weight for the party), and still gets you a nice flow of color-building downtime scenes.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272466/#Comment_272466" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T06:30:07+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  6:30AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another idea:<br><br>You could make the "Keys" things between the characters, like "how do the other members of the party feel about Wintyr?"

(They almost do this now; the use of a Daily power is usually in a climactic encounter.) One thing I can't figure out is how to pace power recharges with the pinging of a key. (As you go up in level, you have more Daily powers at your fingertips. Does this mean you need to keeping hitting more keys on average?)<br/><br/>I do think short rests can remain as is: it seems clear, storywise, when an encounter is over and there is time for encounter-related effects to recharge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272475/#Comment_272475" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T09:51:43+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  9:51AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keys are a too involved solution here. If you want to force drama in 4th edition D&amp;D, it's probably better to just mandate that every extended rest <i>will</i> segue into a dramatic situation. Let the players know this so they're not surprised when you do a hard frame to whatever it is that interests you in the story. No difference as to whether the scene matters to one or more characters - it's a consequence of having a rest, not a requirement. Furthermore, declare that you can't rest if your character doesn't let down his guard, and therefore the GM is allowed to frame characters into a dramatically compromising position for the dramatic segue if he feels like it. This is where you get those situations where a character acts against his own best interests out of momentary passion.<br/><br/>(That's how refresh scenes work in TSoY, incidentally. A much better model for messing with D&amp;D rests than Keys.)<br/><br/>If you specifically want Key-like constant action, give out action points to reward it. (Also fix that absurd action point economy and put in some interesting uses for them, of course.) This way you can give out the bennies when and if the player feels like humouring your dramatic needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272490/#Comment_272490" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T13:39:08+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  1:39PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2010 1:45PM by frozenwastes.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>I think if you want to address some of the problems this might create with pacing and spotlight, you might want to make it less individual-PC-focused...(stuff about party rest tokens that let you "get out of a later rest free")</blockquote>\nI think this is a good idea.

I'd be tempted to agree with Eero, except I'm guessing you might be coming at it from the opposite angle.<br/><br/>In TSoY, play is very character and player-driven, so an opportunity for the GM to throw in something they want to introduce is very welcome. The characters "let down their guard", the GM can introduce some idea they have, the story develops differently than in regular play.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, the GM has a lot of prep work, and is often already responsible for the majority of "the story", or scene framing, providing adversity and challenge to the players. In this context, it sounds like you're looking for a way for you to relax and for the players to take over and move the story along. <br/><br/>If I'm right, those serve two totally opposite purposes. Something *like* Keys (which I agree aren't quite right for what you're going for) introduces story direction from the players' side. You aren't looking for an opportunity to push the story further along (something you do all the time as GM in D&amp;D, probably) but for a respite from that, and for the players to take over.<br/><br/>John and Eero, do you agree or disagree? I'm just guessing here, and would love to hear your thoughts.<br/><br/>As for how to combine Keys and party play? Frame your Keys around the party's goals and interests, as well as inter-party interactions. A party might be described by two Keys, the Key of Revenge Against Duke Humperdinck and the Key of Constant Playful Bickering, whereas another party might have the Key of Highway Robbery and Polyamorous Love Triangle.<br/><br/>If it's the sort of game you want, individuals could "buy out" of Keys, separating themselves from the rest of the party (e.g. taking the side of Duke Humperdinck at a dramatic moment!), or the party as a whole could "buy off" the Key (e.g. they finally stop bickering and decide they all love each other/the polyamorous love triangle is broken up due to jealousy).<br/><br/>If there individual Keys as well, they definitely should be pointed at other characters in the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272503/#Comment_272503" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T15:52:39+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  3:52PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I think you nailed it.<br/><br/>I'm a low prep DM in D&amp;D.  Very low prep.  I also tend to do a lot of improvised type gaming with D&amp;D.  I may throw elements at the group, but they ultimately decide what sticks and where to take it.  Play Unsafe is like my DMG for 4E.  The players I tend to end up with know this (as I'm explicit about it).  I do my best to create situation and do my best to avoid prescribing plot.  The only time I do any legitimate prep work in the traditional sense is during dungeon crawls and even then, no maps are drawn and I generally make the layout and particulars of the locales up on the spot,  I just have some encounters, traps, skill challenges, and the like prepared that I know I'll be able to fit in as appropriate.<br/><br/>Since 4E has come out, the best sessions and campaigns I've run have been those where we've really pushed for characterization.  It's happened sporadically in the free form RP that happens in D&amp;D outside of combat, encounters, skill challenges, etc.,.  But what if there was something built into the pacing mechanic of the game that mandated it rather than sporadically had it happen?<br/><br/>That's one thing I'm after here.  The other is to encourage the players to actually push for things that interest them more as it fits with my approach as an improv heavy approach.

One area where the short and extended rest system falls a little short is times during the campaign where the amount of time between fights is measured more in days than minutes or hours.  Every fight ends up at full HP with full powers, full surges and full use of all dailies.<br/><br/>The simplest fix for that is to mess with extended rests.

That's a very good point. Still, to me it sounds like Nathaniel's game is essentially character-driven.<br/><br/>What Nathaniel writes about the rest system breaking down makes a lot of sense to me: the D&amp;D system very much assumes that the resource-management constraints arise from in-fiction time pressure. You never run out of spells if you can rest after each battle. Notably D&amp;D has always been balanced for the assumption of many combats per day, while fantasy fiction (and realistic fiction even more so) sees no sense in this; you need to really push and twist the fiction to make it sensible that characters have to fight what, three or four times per day. It sort of can be made to work in the dungeon context (at least if you keep the combats small and short and all the players buy into it), but take it out of the dungeon and you'll find that there's rarely any reason for characters to not go all-out in combat (benefitting wizards in earlier editions) and rest afterwards. That's just what makes sense in the fiction.<br/><br/>I don't myself think that 4th edition is fixable in this sense in a satisfactory manner - any fix is going to feel a bit forced due to how the power system is a bit tenuous fictionally in the first place. The best fix is probably along the lines Nathaniel is considering - mandate that rests can only happen once the story moves in certain ways, thus ensuring that it doesn't matter for the game's rest logic whether the characters are travelling between adjacent caves or adjacent towns in between combats. That's unsatisfactory for me in that the fiction doesn't really support the idea that a character can't refresh his powers with a good night's rest. The default rule on expending powers and getting them back by resting sort of just about works for the fiction - well enough for me to accept it for the sake of the game, anyway. Tying power refreshment to dramatic events feels much more forced.<br/><br/>Still, if a fix is desired, I still think that the TSoY-type refresh I suggested above is the way to go for a character-driven game: the GM can use the rest scene to engage in active dialogue over the matters that are important to the characters, and he gets to advance the plot and introduce complications that might seem forced or even unfair if he sprung them arbitrarily. Most significantly, I don't think that it's a good idea to try to preset the dramatic content of the rest scenes, as that results in events that seem too forced: players have to compromise their characters to make them fulfill the rest conditions, or alternatively fail the game - as somebody already mentioned, choosing between bad drama and not getting a refresh in D&amp;D is not really a choice.<br/><br/>Now, if you want players to bring character issues to the fore more consistently, I'd say that Keys as executed in TSoY are a much better idea than messing with the rest mechanics. That is, reward the players with extra xp or action points when they play towards the Keys they choose. This is more flexible, as the players can do it when it makes sense for the game's pacing, and it's more fun because it's a carrot and not a stick: a player does not lose anything at any given moment by not scoring a Key, and nobody has to accept forced efforts, because advancing the game isn't dependent on it.<br/><br/>Of course, if I was swapping D&amp;D's rests for TSoY refreshes and D&amp;D's xp mechanics for Keys, I might as well start playing TSoY instead ;D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272666/#Comment_272666" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T15:23:57+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  3:23PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2010 3:26PM by frozenwastes.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The best fix is probably along the lines Nathaniel is considering - mandate that rests can only happen once the story moves in certain ways, thus ensuring that it doesn't matter for the game's rest logic whether the characters are travelling between adjacent caves or adjacent towns in between combats.

Even the very-D&amp;D fiction (ie, TSR/WotC's novels) always contain information about what is going on when a rest happens.  And none of them do the "one night's sleep = all wounds, fractures, burns and concussions go away" thing.  Usually there's some sort of narrative about praying to get spells back, studying a spell book, being healed by magic-- something.  And it's either contrived to allow the author to have the character do his full range of powers in the next action scene in the book, or it's part of some characterization moment, like when Drizzt gets a broken bone healed by a <i>surface</i> elf cleric.<br/><br/>One explanation for the encounter and daily powers that I remember hearing from Mike Mearls in a podcast around the release of 4E is that they're not necessarily the type of thing a character can only do once per fight or once per day, but that they only have a chance of successfully getting off once per fight or once per day.  And this is done for game challenge purposes.  So how about this:  All powers are available to be used at all times, but expended powers always count as rolling a 1 for attack and have no effects or keywords and have no effect on a miss.  This allows them to be used for story purposes outside of combat/skill challenges.<br/><br/>An example from actual play.  Bahuman the cleric was the manifestation of the two dragon gods Bahumat and Tiamat.  In him was the potential for the sundered dragon gods to be reborn as the unified god of the dragons, Io.  Bahuman had a daily power that pulled everyone around him close, blasted them with magic and then threw them away.  Adam, Bahuman's player, always described it as spectral dragon heads of all the colours of all dragons appearing, lashing out and grabbing people and then tossing them away.<br/><br/>And he'd use it in non-combat encounters all the time.  One particular example would be when he wanted to intimidate two characters who were on the verge of violence into setting aside their squabble and focus on the mission they were on.  So he narrated stepping between them, sending out his dragon heads and and then tossing them away from one another.

That's basically perfect.)<br/><br/>I think it would be useful to zoom out and look at what the different kinds of rests give you:<br/><br/><b>Short rest:</b> (a) Recharge encounter powers; (b) spend healing surges to heal HP.<br/><br/><b>Extended rest:</b> (c) Recharge all powers; (d) regain all HP and surges; (e) reset Action Points.<br/><br/><b>Milestones (not a rest but related)</b>: (h) Gain an Action Point; (h) fiddly recharge of some daily magic-item powers.<br/><br/>Also, not all powers are created equal. Some encounter powers just provide extra *boom* to the player (a Ranger could do alright just sticking with Twin Strike), but some are core class features that the players needs to get anywhere (e.g. the Avenger's "Oath of Enmity"). For this reason, I feel like Encounter powers might tend to be more tied to being available in every encounter, while Daily powers might be more elective.

It would make sense that any scene that describes how you go about healing (i.e. you talk to the sage and they give you a salve or whatnot) allows you to spend surges similarly.<br/><br/> - Daily powers start uncharged; when you ping a Key, you can recharge a Daily power. (But: it's tricky to balance this with the larger number of daily powers you have at higher levels.)<br/><br/>- When you buy off a Key or hit some other scene that is similarly Climatic, you gain the benefits of an Extended Rest, in terms of powers, surges and HP.<br/><br/>- An Extended Rest only occurs after several days of in-fiction and rest and total disengagement from active conflicts. So, it basically won't happen in the middle of the action; you'll have to rely on combination of Keys and Refreshment to recharge daily powers and grant you new surges. (Balancing this properly would be most tricky.)<br/><br/>- Keep it arbitrary. Stretch out the game's expected "adventuring day" to be tied to in-game events that are adjucated ad hoc. Powers recharge after any disengagement or cut scene, while an extended rest only happens after reaching major fictional milestones. (This focuses on tying mechanical emphasis to the flow of the plot, but doesn't try to incentivize specific Keys for RP.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272692/#Comment_272692" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T19:50:47+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  7:50PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2010 7:51PM by frozenwastes.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite><br/>I think it would be useful to zoom out and look at what the different kinds of rests give you:<br/><br/><b>Short rest:</b>(a) Recharge encounter powers; (b) spend healing surges to heal HP.<br/><br/><b>Extended rest:</b>(c) Recharge all powers; (d) regain all HP and surges; (e) reset Action Points.<br/><br/><b>Milestones (not a rest but related)</b>: (h) Gain an Action Point; (h) fiddly recharge of some daily magic-item powers.<br/></blockquote>\nExcellent.

The Avenger thing is a non issue though as the power Refreshes itself upon the execution of the Oath target.<br/><br/>Maybe some control of what you refresh.  What about the key getting played gives you 2 or 3 tokens you can distribute to the party as you like (including keeping all three) and that can be spent on the different kinds of refreshes.  Some of them would end up being redundant.<br/><br/>So by spending a token you can do one of:<br/><br/>1) Spend as many healing surges as you like<br/>2) Get back surges<br/>3) Refresh encounter powers<br/>4) Refresh daily powers including daily item powers<br/>5) Gain an action point                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
