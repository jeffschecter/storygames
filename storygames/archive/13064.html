Even Carl "I don't generally play GM-less games" Rigney was facilitating a game. Although he was somehow cutoff in the picture, so I can't prove he was there.<br/><br/>Five different playsets, and I don't remember them all so perhaps folks could chime in.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i51.tinypic.com/20kyv0i.jpg"/><br/><br/>I debuted the final version of my JFK/Dallas 1963 playset. (Thanks Jason and Steve!!)<br/><br/>A plan was a-foot between an Italian low-level gangster (Tommy), a hen-pecked night accountant at the Texas School Book Depository (Jerry) and a failed White Russian hitman (Yuri) looking for the next big score. They were to wack Bobby Kennedy (referred to as "that dirty Jew") who was traveling with the President's motorcade through Dallas. Some missteps happened along the way, and the alcoholic hitman screwed up again and shot JFK instead. "He was in the first car! He looked just like Bobby! What."<br/><br/>Best supporting actress definitely goes to Becky, the kinda hot wife who gave her medal-winning husband Jerry no end of grief. Perhaps not surprisingly, she ended up in a ditch with a bullet in her head after accidentally finding Tommy's set of near-perfect $100 plates and trying to hide them in the clothes dryer.<br/><br/>Also, Jerry and Tommy had a great flashback scene to a windswept attack on Hill 504 during the Korean War. Tommy shot their gung-ho Lt. in the head and kept Jerry  from getting his ticket punched early on an ill-fated suicide run.<br/><br/>I love how tight a 3-player game of Fiasco is. There aren't many scenes, and you don't have space for sub-plots. So you dig right down and make the dirty happen *now*.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294530/#Comment_294530" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T10:19:38+00:00" title="September 24, 2010 10:19AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            aw... man!

I played Lilly Lynch, his childhood friend who'd disappointed him in the past. Alan Sugarbaker played Buck Fiphty, Lilly's ex-husband, who'd come to Manna because he knew it was the one place in the world Lilly would never go again. Buck was working on his Great American Novel and paying for his room by having sex with Jamie (loathsome romance relationship). There was a valuable samurai sword, and the old cemetery, and the need to find out the truth behind the coverup in Manna.  All 3 PCs were in their late 30's.<br/><br/>I've played once before, facilitating Repo Depot at the April minicon, and facilitated this time. It was Chris &amp; Alan's first game,<br/>and they brought the pain.<br/><br/>It started with Lilly (who hadn't seen Jamie in 20 years) getting off the bus with a hockey bag and checking into the Motel, next door to her ex-husband Buck.<br/><br/>A lot of bad things happened, and bad choices were made. We never did see what that head in the bathtub was about, but it didn't do the maid any good to have seen it.<br/><br/>It ended in a bloody gunfight at dawn in a Kansas rest stop with Buck accidentally shooting Jamie with a shotgun and (intentionally) gunning down and being gunned down by the corrupt Sheriff Kyle and his corrupt deputy/son Kyle Jr.<br/><br/><i>My</i> favorite scene was Jamie's flashback 20 years ago when he nervously invited his best friend Lilly into his bedroom, gave her the samurai sword his grandfather brought back from The War, and confessed he was gay. She thought he was gonna ask her to the Prom. The next time they saw each other was when she walked into the Motel.<br/><br/>Aftermath scenes  (Black 1, Black 0, Black 5) included Jamie's funeral, where Jamie's mom made Lilly sit with family because she was his childhood friend, and Jamie's family watching Buck put to death for four murders.  As the credits rolled, the guards cleaned out Buck's death row cell and threw his handwritten manuscript of heartbreaking genius into the trash with the rest of his life.<br/><br/>I had a great time! I really like that playset.  And I appreciate Ryan Macklin reminding all 5 tables halfway through to use our indoor voices, since we'd done that thing where people talk louder and Louder and LOUDER.   A reset every hour or two makes the noise level a lot more tolerable.

It seems the best laid plans of mice and wise guys oft go horribly awry.  The lesson is: if you want something to be done right, do it yourself (particularly if the alternative is to hire a drunken racist Russian who can barely make ends meet).<br/><br/>-Steven                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294687/#Comment_294687" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T18:38:25+00:00" title="September 26, 2010  6:38PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in Ryan Macklin's Last Frontier game. I'd like to publicly thank him for facilitating and organizing these Endgame nights. Thanks!<br/><br/>I have to be a bit contrary and say that I had a lot of trouble with this game. I've been thinking about why, and came up with my theory that it's because of my screenwriter background. <br/><br/>Years of classes and peer review groups have ingrained in me the habit of knowing exactly what the conflict of scene should be, and how it should play out. In Fiasco, Ryan suggested a much looser kind of play, and it really threw me for a loop. I spent a lot of the time completely confused (more so in my normal day-to-day state), and Ryan even noted that I looked lost.<br/><br/>I spent a lot of time choosing to resolve rather than establish, because I, at least, could know how a scene would play out. <br/><br/>I would like to add a disclaimer that I had been suffering insomnia, so my brain was only functioning at one tenth of its power (which isn't particularly powerful to begin with). <br/><br/>This statement of confusion should not be taken as a criticism or knock against Ryan, our group, or the game. I had fun regardless of my confusion.<br/><br/>Ryan also mentioned that first-time players, such as I, have trouble with Fiasco. I was wondering if other people had similar or dissimilar problems<br/><br/>I definitely would like to play again, especially with a good night's sleep! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
