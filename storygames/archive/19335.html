How likely is it that the 'trad' games simply drown out the special-snowflake indies in this method?<br/><br/>The reason I ask about trad/indie is because it is difficult to make sense of the hypothesis without it.

So length is not an issue.  All of the texts so far have really short sections on What is a RPG. By converting to words to frequency of occurrence instead of just raw counts I can remove most of the bias between texts. I use another method where I chunk that data (break up the text into small pieces) that greatly reduces the variability within and between texts. <br/><br/>I am still working reducing bias from sampling issues. Mostly making sure we have enough texts represented. <br/><br/>The implications of data so far point to trad and story games don't talk about what rpgs are differently. <br/><br/>If you want to moderately push this data (like JD said in another thread) the trad/story thing is just false dichotomy used for social currency. <br/><br/>There are other things we can query like how much of a text is player facing vs gm facing. I suspect we would see something there but not necessarily trad and story.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430526/#Comment_430526" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T07:13:09+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  7:13AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is role-play?   Glad you asked.  If you are new to the concept of a role-play game, let me try to explain.  Role-play is the ability to put yourself into uncommon situations and try to play (act) out your resolution of problems.  When I say act, I do not mean brandish sword and take the stage.  Rather, role-play is imagination under a set of guidelines.  It is a structured form of daydreaming.<br/><br/>Some groups of role-players use elaborate maps, finely-painted miniatures, and a plethora of visual and mechanical aids; mostly these are used to represent spatial relationships.  These may be used, but role-play is the interaction of real people in surreal conditions.  Intrigued or confused into continuing?  Then, I will try to explain the attitude you should take to play <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crimson Cutlass</span>.<br/><br/>Referee will develop situations, missions, and encounters for the player to conquer or be vanquished, to profit or be swindled, and to command or be controlled.  The player should remain loyal to his King and proud of his homeland.  He should set priorities: gold, adventure, personal victory and power.  He should always be plotting and investing, at times risking all on ventures with little chance of success, but with payback that justifies the danger.<br/><br/>When you role-play, it is easy to be yourself and this is adequate, but strive to diversify play by adopting extremes in personality: heroic or ruthless, eccentric or demanding, and frivolous or meticulous.  At times become unpredictable, brutal, even bloodthirsty, but always with a motive and never out of randomness.  Be patient and knowledgeable, yet aloof to the mundane realities and responsibilities of the "paper-world".  You must be equally as charitable, boisterous and gallant.<br/><br/>You should never prey on those unrelated to your mission; however, if anyone is involved, even slightly, he is both suspect and victim to the bulk of your actions.  Try to respect and marvel the workings of the State, the intricacies of trade, and the delicacies of war on both your homeland and allies.  But also try to disrupt enemy nations, especially when instructed by Church or King.  You are a piece in the grand political game, but usually more than a pawn.  Always remember when wronged; you should be vengeful and duty-bound, but as each time your "paper-self" dies - start anew - play from the new person's point of view.<br/><br/>If your "paper-self" should falter or veer in loyalty, either seek to atone or complete your switch to a new homeland and alliances.  Be a pious player with religious zeal; conquest for your beliefs as much as your greed.  The "paper-self", you play, should always pay debts and return services loyally.  The "paper-self" will never refuse free food or drink, unless something is foul.  Please never be trite, but above all enjoy.  If you're not having fun, tell someone; everyone is important.  State your views openly and keep from becoming a servitor - be a character in the plots of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crimson Cutlass</span>.<br/><br/>- "Crimson Cutlass", George Rahm, 1979 (quote from 1989 ed.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430532/#Comment_430532" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T10:26:11+00:00" title="April  4, 2014 10:26AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WORD ASSOCIATIONS<br/>Using built in functions in R I looked at what words are associated with a target word (like adventure) at a frequency of at least 0.35 (35%).

covered. Isn't an alternative hypothesis the idea that trad &amp; story games both describe the phenomenon of role playing the same way, but have differing degrees of follow-through in the actual rules. So there is a real difference, but the rules are the place to look, not the <i>stated</i> goals.

Let's say "a hypothesis for future research." <br/><br/>So, I know that this is outside of what your current dataset can speak to, but even if you find that trad &amp; story games both describe RP the same way, it does not necessarily follow that they are ultimately the same. If the rules as written in trad games lead to one style of play and story game rules lead to another, I don't think it's fair to call that a false dichotomy even if the "what is RP" in the preface reads similarly.<br/><br/>PS - I actually use R at work myself, so I'm nerdily excited to see it pop up on Story-Games                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430570/#Comment_430570" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-05T18:26:12+00:00" title="April  5, 2014  6:26PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/uolmir">@uolmir</a> I get what you are saying.

I worked with George for a while at a film sound FX company.  That cat was deep <i>in</i> his world.  At the same time he was writing that, I was writing "CyberSpace" for Iron Crown, for which the "What Is" section is quoted below...\n<blockquote><b>A role playing game needs \u201crules\u201d (or guidelines) to define and control the physical realities of the world in which adventures may take place. Ideally, such rules are able to handle most of the common situations that might arise without detracting from the flavor and detail of the plot or setting of the game.</b> This specific set of rules handles the physical realities of people, places and things in the dark future world of Cyberspace, where the ultrapowerful MegaCorps have all but enslaved mankind and doomed life on planet Earth to a dismal shadowy existance; where human beings have mastered the incredible interface of mind and machine; where fully one-third of the general population possesses cybernetic implants or enhancements; and tens of thousands have escaped to the orbital and lunar space colonies. In setting the tone and technological mood of the game, this work has drawn heavily from the writings of such dark-future masters as William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Philip K. Dick , Walter J. Williams, and John Brunner, as well as many others whose visions are not quite so grim but nonetheless insightful. This text contains all the prospective Gamemaster (\u201cGM\u201d) needs to know about setting up a Cyberspace campaign.<br/><br/>The GM should keep in mind that these \u201crules\u201d are really only guidelines to aid in the creation and running of a dark future role playing campaign. The GM should feel free to modify them to fit any specific view or style of role playing, and the Players should realize that the GM is the final authority when it comes to rules interpretations or changes. On the other hand, these rules and the GM\u2019s decisions concerning them are the only guide that the Players have to their characters\u2019 capabilities and the reality of the Cyberspace world. The GM must be consistent and fair when making decisions or the Players will lose the trust and confidence necessary for a truly enjoyable and satisfying role playing game.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430590/#Comment_430590" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T17:30:46+00:00" title="April  6, 2014  5:30PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The topic modeling is here:<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjWb0o2WBA-AdDNSUVlfZ0VuR3NhSTdFY3NVMk4yUHc&amp;usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Topic Modeling of What is a RPG</a><br/><br/>If you want to know what topic modeling is:<br/><a href="http://tedunderwood.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/" rel="nofollow">tedunderwood.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430607/#Comment_430607" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T05:06:22+00:00" title="April  7, 2014  5:06AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming a little late to the discussion but I'm curious as to what y'all think the difference in language between "trad" and "Indie" would be? My gut feeling would be that there's very little difference - the indie scene are the inheritors of traditional language about RPGs. There's a continuum of formal terms here, although the application of their meaning in real terms might be different (A PC in D&amp;D and a PC in Fiasco are both Player Characters but are radically different in play, right?). <br/><br/>So, I guess what I'm saying is: Would doing a comparison of word-data between these two groups be meaningful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
