Just about every privilege in the game has an implicit "only use this liberty to advance your role in the cooperative" tag to it.<br/><br/>Bringing the latter type of rules-understanding to a game with the former type of presumption tends to lead to degenerative play, as the game is designed to provide "liberty with responsibility" rather than "absolute liberty"; the game is able to give freedom and options without excessive fencing, but only by assuming that the players will utilize those freedoms for the common good. What fencing there is has a normative and pedagogical function rather than being a systemic attempt at security.<br/><br/>For a contrasting example of what a rules system with consistent "free range" thinking looks like, consider <i>Universalis</i>: it does not presume per se that the players have any sort of creative cohesion to their play, and in fact the covert negotiation over the creative coordination is much of the point of play - you only get to the point where Polaris starts after you've been playing Universalis for a while. In the meantime, play is maintained by a set of cold, soulless and abstract rules about point-buying fictional elements, voting down disruptive initiatives, and so on. Technically speaking it is not a procedural problem for Universalis if a player is a jerk; you just keep parrying and counter-parrying until the cows come home, and a play will have been had, roughly in the way the game text envisions.<br/><br/>I personally find it very curious that regardless of the seemingly great difference between the "power and responsibility" school and the "free range" school of thought, both types of games are best played by soulful, observant individuals with curiousity and respect towards the emerging fiction. One would assume that a proper free range game would suit superficial players who could entertain themselves and each other like a proverbial herd of bulls in a china shop, but ultimately it seems to be difficult for such players to be <i>interesting</i>. It's not that a free range game breaks down so much as it never goes anywhere if the players don't listen to each other and work together. In this regard I suppose that although Polaris may be misplayed due to a misunderstanding about the modal nature of the conflict rules, the fundamental problem is not that somebody's a "free range player" - the problem is that they're so insensitive that they keep doing the unfun thing again and again, instead of examining their assumptions a bit and discovering a different way of collaborating with the other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462470/#Comment_462470" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T03:35:43+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  3:35AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2017 4:52PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In another thread, Jeff said:\n<blockquote>We played a simplified form of Polaris for one-shots; it didn't go great.

In one of the stories the player playing the antagonist was saying things like "I want to completely destroy him," and the like; he seemed to be playing to <i>win</i> rather than playing to create a collaborative story with the group. The player has a lot of strengths but I think he was emphasizing <i>his</i> story over the <i>group's</i> story. I think this was simply a learning curve and not interpreting and using the rules correctly...and we had more issues than just this one. In the other story this wasn't an issue at all; instead, the players just didn't seem to be into the mechanics of the game. <br/><br/>As far as others not appreciating the mechanic,  I think it's because in one of the "but, only ifs"  we went back and forth quite a bit, and not interpreting the rules correctly at first, we wiped all that out and just went back to the beginning of the exchange when there was a disagreement about what should happen\u2026 I think this event got stuck in one of the players minds because when we were talking about play after the game, he said: "why waste all the time going back-and-forth if you're only going to erase it all."  I tried to emphasize that we just misinterpreted the rules and that other times when we used the mechanic we didn't do this, but it didn't seem to stick. He just thought that the mechanic didn't add much to the game, and I think he ended up wrapping up his story early because he wasn't having a good time. As I said in the other post, I think this was in large part due to us just using the mechanic poorly and not to aid in the story.   Which really sucks, because the ideas that this player (i.e. the player that didn't like the mechanic) introduced to the story were really cool and interesting and I wish they could have  been developed more. I also think that we should've made the "but, only if" more relevant at the scene level and connected to the scene, because I think that too often too big of events were going on  very little detail\u2026stuff like: "but, only if the town burns down and everyone dies."  I think that these big events are fine in moderation but if they make up most of the story it seems like they become an issue.  <br/><br/>It was quite a disappointing session, because I know you folks up at Story Games Seattle play Polaris a lot and have a high opinion of it...and I have a high opinion of what you've created up there, so I know if you recommend a game it must have a lot of potential. Anyway Ben, or anyone else, if you have any other questions or would like some more details <br/>let me know and I would be happy to discuss the session further. I would love any advice on how to get Polaris to shine so I can convince our group to give it another go :-)  I'm going to <br/>read the link you provided and I'm sure it will help a lot  :-) Thanks :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462472/#Comment_462472" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T07:06:25+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  7:06AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2017 7:07AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So much awful! Yeesh, that sounds terrible Jeff.<br/><br/>Like I said and what Eero reinforced, it's definitely about starting from the right point of view: "I want to completely destroy him" is completely wrong. The protagonist is *all of our* protagonist. We are all interested in their story. I try to really make that clear when we're picking roles, before anything about the conflict mechanic is even discussed.<br/><br/>Another very simple point is to say that you should always be trying to offer things the other player is into, even if it's bad for their character. I know it sounds contrary, but it's totally true: my character might not like their loyal follower being slain by a demon, but as a player I should hopefully be saying "oh no! that's so dramatic!"\n<blockquote>One would assume that a proper free range game would suit superficial players who could entertain themselves and each other like a proverbial herd of bulls in a china shop, but ultimately it seems to be difficult for such players to be <i>interesting</i>.

One of the big issues was that the Protagonist was never really given an opportunity to get invested in anything...I think I'm going to play the simplified version of Polaris (i.e. SGS version) with my other group for now and hopefully in time I can re-introduce it to the the Indie RPGs &amp; Story Games SLC folks in such a way that they give it another chance. I really think the game has a lot to offer.  Perhaps, I can play an AP for them, that turned out well, to give them an idea of the games potential and what we, as a group, may be able to do to produce a great session.

The issue is rather universal, and pretty much my only cure for combatting it is to try to get people to play less like a director and more like they were their own character.<br/><br/>This only happens with players who are wholly on board with the storifying creative agenda, by the way - the issue is technical and perhaps psychological. The problem would also not occur if the game was not an advocacy game, but rather something that genuinely had room for the players to relinquish their advocacy role.<br/><br/><i>Polaris</i>, though, is not that kind of game - it fully requires the players to claim their roles and play them. Even a player who hopes for a tragic end to their character needs to act like a GM, bite the bullet, play their role and hope for the other players to play theirs. If the antagonist is doing their job, <i>they</i> will bring on the tragedy, while <i>you</i> try to avert it. You might not try too hard, in which case you'll get that tragedy, but you still need to try for the game to function.<br/><br/>Because advocacy-based games are so common, this problem is also pretty common. The only cure seems to be to make it clear to the players that they don't have the option, the luxury, of giving up before the story's over. Your job of advocating for your character is not a privilege, it's a duty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462606/#Comment_462606" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T18:19:45+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  6:19PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly!

Since I had stopped advocating for my character and was maneuvering him into failure, instead, the other players couldn't really engage with me. I ended up narrating the scene almost entirely by myself and it was extremely unsatisfying to all of us.</blockquote>\nIn more general terms, I'm fond of any kind of ending mechanics which embrace this situation as a feature. The moment you realize you've stopped advocating for your character, it's time to stop playing by the usual rules and just tell us what your character's ending is... Or maybe wait until everybody has reached that point, then end the game with closing vignettes. But that isn't <i>Polaris</i>.<br/><br/>IIRC, though, Polaris specifically does have a mechanism or at least a principle for dealing with that: the Mistaken's job is to oppose what the Heart is trying to accomplish, whatever it is. The moment they understand the Heart has in fact allied with the demons, it's a Mistaken's duty to make this as hard on them as struggling for the people used to be. Extending this to cover your case, Paul, isn't much of a stretch: if you, as the Heart, are actively courting failure, I, as the Mistaken, will try to make you succeed, in the worst possible way. If you want to die, I'll fight to save your life, so that you can contemplate your own misery. If you've embraced your grand tragedy, I'll try to turn it into some petty failure or bittersweet ending - so that to have your tragedy <i>the way you want it</i> you'll have to earn it, to fight for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462625/#Comment_462625" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T23:33:03+00:00" title="April 28, 2017 11:33PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2017 11:37PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>IIRC, though, Polaris specifically does have a mechanism or at least a principle for dealing with that: the Mistaken's job is to oppose what the Heart is trying to accomplish, whatever it is.

It sounds about right, doesn't it? However, we decided that there was no obvious way we could have identified this and pivoted quickly and smoothly enough. As a dynamic emerging in long-term play, or something flagged explicitly by the player, sure. To be able to spot that in a single scene and play appropriately... not so obvious.<br/><br/>(Edited to Add...) <br/><br/><i>If you doubt this, consider your own example: "If you've embraced your grand tragedy, I'll try to turn it into some petty failure"... You've got exactly the right idea, but to do this WELL is incredibly difficult. Turning a "grand tragedy" into a "petty failure", unless you're playing a comedy, is hard to do in a satisfying way. If we're playing Fiasco, it will likely work; in a tragic ice epic fantasy, the players have to get really good and on the same page to pull that off in a way which feels good and is satisfying to everyone. A lot of things have to come together *just right*...<br/></i>\n<blockquote><br/>Take a look at this: <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/163/antagonism-101/" rel="nofollow">Antagonism 101, or, being the right kind of mean</a></blockquote>\nBen,<br/><br/>I just read your link - fantastic! Simple and right to the point. I'd add a few things, perhaps, about mirroring the protagonist, about providing them with opportunities, and maybe about creating false tension, but you've nailed the basic core of good fictional antagonism.<br/><br/>It's also - in a very direct sense - exactly what makes <i>Polaris</i> good. The dynamic you describe is baked into the game; it's how the game works. The entire game is about making this happen, through the negotiation mechanic (mainly via the "but only if..." phrase).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462645/#Comment_462645" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-29T05:45:46+00:00" title="April 29, 2017  5:45AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seem to recall that one way to make a one shot work is to roll two dice on experience rolls.<br/><br/>The hardest thing for our group to learn was that we actually had to fight against letting The Mistake dumping Bad Stuff on our PCs.
