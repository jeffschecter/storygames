It was caused by a combination of Real Life(TM) and the venue (the Old Bath House) changing management while I was trying to prevent another double booking. Happily, both of these are now resolved and its all systems go for 14 September!<br/><br/>We'll still be in the Old Bath House, the same as ever. The church group should have the message that their meeting is cancelled that day, and we should be able to get into the kitchen.<br/><br/>That also means the entry cost will remain at \xa35.00. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.leisuregames.com/" rel="nofollow">Leisure Games</a> have confirmed they'll be attending again with lots of shiny books. Mike will be turning up at different times, however. Rather than getting up at the crack of dawn, he'll be appearing mid-morning and staying until the evening games have started. That should give you all more time to peruse his stall and buy everything you can.<br/><br/>We're after a couple of things from you. <br/><br/>First is games! We have one eager beaver, Pete, who's already offered a game of <i>Torchbearer</i> (blurb below). But we need more. Please send be your game blurbs, by whatever means, and I'll add them to the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games</a> list. <br/><br/>The other thing is that we'll be having another charity raffle at Concrete CowThe last one raised \xa3120 for the Alzheimer's Society, so we'll be seeing if we can beat that total in September. If you have any items you'd like to put up as prizes, please let us know. <br/><br/>(I know someone has already offered a prize for the raffle, but I've managed to lose your email. Could you please contact me again?)<br/><br/>And without further ado, here's the Torchbearer blurb:<br/>Torchbearer<br/><br/><b>Black Deeds in Blackmoor</b><br/><i>Adventurer is a dirty word. You\u2019re a scoundrel, a villain, a wastrel, a vagabond, a criminal, a sword-for-hire, a cutthroat.</i><br/>Torchbearer is a dungeon crawl role-playing game and love letter to Basic D&amp;D. In it, you take on the role of an adventurer seeking his or her fortune. To earn that fortune, you must explore forlorn ruins, brave terrible monsters and retrieve forgotten treasures.<br/><br/>* Players: 3-4<br/>* DM: Pete                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419843/#Comment_419843" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T12:53:59+00:00" title="August  9, 2013 12:53PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick update, just to keep people reminded about this!<br/><br/>Games continue to come in.

I really enjoyed my first Cow in March this year, and I'm already looking forward to the next one. For those who haven't yet been, it's a nice, friendly, local con which punches firmly above its weight. It draws a wide variety of gamers, including some big name designers like James Mullen and Scott Dorward, who also act as hosts. Expect lots of cracking games and a warm, welcoming atmos. Not to mention the legendary Indian lunch buffet, a snip at \xa310/person.

Which is good, seeing as there's only a week to go. I've confirmed all the bits necessary that I need to sort out: the hall's sorted after the change in administrators and the church group know not to arrive, Leisure Games are coming (remember, Mike's turning up mid-morning and staying later), and the Eastern Paradise are expecting us for lunch. <br/><br/>A couple of other updates. I've arranged for Paul Baldowski to send down some <a href="http://www.allrolledup.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">All Rolled Up</a> dice+pen+card organiser bag thingies (look at the website for details). I'll be doing my best to sell them to people, purely because I think they're a nifty idea. <br/><br/>The charity raffle is sort of coming together, but Real Life(TM) managed to get in the way of begging for prizes. If you have some prizes you'd like to donate to raise money for the Alzheimer's Society, please get in touch.<br/><br/>But most importantly, the list of games is growing apace! We now have 20 games on offer, with a few more awaiting confirmation and blurb. The full list is on the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games</a>, and I'm sure there will be more games offered on the day.<br/><br/>See you all in a week or so!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
