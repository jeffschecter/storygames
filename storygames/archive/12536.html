Two players were at the table with me, both of them guys I knew.  We talked about maybe running with two and doubling up characters with switching scenes alternately, but it just didn't feel right with less than three.<br/><br/>One guy got up and went to the bathroom and the Con monitor came by and asked me if the game was going.  I wanted my two buddies to get prizes for actually signing up and showing up for my game, so I lied to him and said, "Yeah man, we're just taking a little break."  He handed me first, second and third place certificates, which I knew could be turned in for little door prizes.<br/><br/>Then I felt hella guilty.<br/><br/>I just HAD to find a third player.  I scanned the con floor and saw nobody I knew except for the four guys who were in the session of The Mountain Witch that had been creating characters for the past forty minutes.  I was about to kick it with two players when I saw a guy walk through that I recognized.  I had seen him as one of the presenters at a neat Steampunk Q&amp;A panel from the day before.  He wasn't in costume because, as the panel host pointed out, he'd been too busy prepping to run some games.  It clicked in my head right then.  Guy who runs games + was on a Steampunk panel = the perfect candidate!<br/><br/>I hustled past several full tables of gamers and called his name out.  He stopped and look at me funny, because he'd never seen me in his life.  I briefly explained, "Hey, sorry to bother you, but I'm over here trying to run a STEAMPUNK RPG and I need a third player.  Would you like to join us?"<br/><br/>That's when I realized how funky this must be for him.  But he simply said, "I'm not doing anything else... why not?" and followed me back to the table.  He chose to play Snargle, had never played anything like the Shadow of Yesterday or even heard of Lady Blackbird, but when I showed him the pic of The Owl, his eyes gleamed.  I knew I had him.<br/><br/>I stole a page from Ryan Macklin's book and asked each player to describe what actor would lay their version of their PC in the Lady Blackbird movie.  The player of Captain Vance said, "Bruce Campbell, of course."  I looked to the guy who chose Kale Arkam and he said, "The skinny blonde guy from the BBC version (the original) of The Office".  Then I asked our new Steampunk aficionado friend and he said, "He would be voiced by Bob Hoskins!"<br/><br/>Turns out that the player of Snargle had some engineering background.  When I described the prison cell, he caught that I described the locks as pneumatic.  He shapeshifted to shimmy through the bars and bent a pipe to release the pressure and bammo, they're out of the cell.  Later, they peer in on guards playing poker (I don't know why I always do that during the escape scene!) and I ask him what the guards' uniforms look like.  He quickly rattles off some nice double-breasted pin-striped coats and high boots and we're rocking.  All through the game, I'm asking him, "What's a cool steampunky look for a hangar on a ship this size?" and he would flow with some crazy gear monstrosity.  When they've escaped and have a moment of relaxation and I interrupt with a sky squid attack, he describes this wack-adoo piloting maneuver that sets up Arkam to fire full bore in the squid's mouth AND gets them out of there at full throttle and everyone is cheering him on.<br/><br/>We ended the game with the crew reaching Nightport and Captain Vance heading out to the bazaar to buy fuel with Snargle, who we find out, can actually taste fuel to see it's quality... who knew?  That's when Vance ends the game by revealing that he has no plans on actually finding the Remnants, just keeping Lady Blackbird safe with them until she "comes around"...<br/><br/>I even pimped voting for Lady B for Best Free Game at the ENnies at the end of the game as everyone was packing up and heading over to the prize table.  It was glorious.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281539/#Comment_281539" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T23:30:31+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 11:30PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>I stole a page from Ryan Macklin's book and asked each player to describe what actor would lay their version of their PC in the Lady Blackbird movie.</blockquote>\nI've read this book all too often, I'm afraid;)<br/><br/>Sounds like a fun session!
