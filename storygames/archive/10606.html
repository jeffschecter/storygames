What caught my eye was Elizabeth's comment that Mist Robed Gate was produced on a budget of $50...which seems pretty extraordinary given how fine a book it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany, if not most, indie games are produced on a pretty limited budget.  So I thought what would you do with $1000?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf some RPG benefactor with money to burn were to offer you $1000 for the purpose of producing the best RPG you could (assuming the honor system is fully sufficient here)...what would you do with it?  What would the additional money allow you to do that you couldn't do or would struggle doing now?  Anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine said benefactor announced "Pitch me your game ideas and the designer whose idea I like best will get $1000 to bring it to fruition", what would such a grant enable you to do that you aren't already doing for Game Chef or your own private projects (again assuming a functioning honor system where the money was actually being used and not just taken and spent).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you've already published, what would you do differently if you'd had an extra $1000 to spend on the project?<br/>\n<br/>\nGo ahead and think outside the box here...but I am looking for serious possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if it were $10,000?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235224/#Comment_235224" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T10:27:58+00:00" title="October  2, 2009 10:27AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Art, layout and book design.

That can be expensive. It's a labor of love, so I'd want the book to be as beautiful as it could possibly be (which means not skimping on the art). I can still get beautiful photography for cheap, though, so that's not where all the money would go. <br><br>I'd like to do something guerrilla marketing style, maybe a mystery to solve with a cool prize, or a "can you find this guy/object/etc in the real world?"

Android is a different story--should be basically free to develop for it.

Those funds mean I could travel to host free events, potentially testing GLASS in the UK and Scandinavia, with the LARP sensibilities of those major regions. I could also afford to give away quite a few books, to long-running games, in the hopes of building a game-crossing community/living world.

I'd find a group of cool young designers and pay them some money to put together a game, say the same crowd who worked on Sexy Deadly with me for the game design contest (I know that Joe probably has 12 dozen game ideas lying around). I'd be the producer. I could pay a designer, writer, and artist $323 each to collaborate on the game. Then I'd come up with some kind of half decent marketing plan and put it out there. If it works, maybe I'd do it again with another crowd. $1000 isn't enough money for me to realize anything I can't already realize with resources I have. Now if you could get me a month off work, that would be a different story.<br/><br/>For $10,000 I think I could create something pretty awesome that I can't create properly with the resources I have. With $10,000 I could hire some programming resources and take it online. For example, I have a spec I've written for a "room-a-day" online dungeon exploration / sports management game. You manage a dungeon delving party in which you are the primary investor. Every day you get a room/encounter in your inbox, prioritize your resources, create a plan, set your party loose and see what happens. And I've got another version that's a planet-a-day. Basically you explore a planet each day, and all the planets are stored persistently online. Think of it as Oregon Trail meets Galactic played online. I can't create either of those unless I can buy development resources or take a bunch of time off my day job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235264/#Comment_235264" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T13:19:43+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  1:19PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd spend it on risk -- it would allow me to move to a print-and-distribute model instead of the zero risk Lulu one.

I guess I might use it to print more copies, initially, as long as I was relatively sure I could sell them.  That would lower costs across the board, being able to print on a larger scale.<br/><br/>Also, $1000 doesn't generally buy you much in the way of really good art.  Maybe 3-4 images if you're lucky. Less than that and you're probably under-paying the artist or getting work that's less good, in my experience.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, in the same way that I wouldn't want to sell my creative property to someone else, I don't think I'd want someone to give me money to help with production costs on my games.  Production is possible on all sorts of scales and, honestly, people should stick with a scale that works for them.  You know all the horror stories about people sinking $2000+ into a print run and not being able to sell their game?  That's what happens when people's financial resources -- including what they can borrow -- exceeds their ability to find an audience.  Being an indie game designer-publisher is as much about suffering through the process and making hard decisions as it is about having a product available for sale.  And, just like constraint in game mechanics can be beneficial to your play experiences, financial constraints can actually force you to make smarter decisions about how to publish your game.<br/><br/>From working as a sub-contractor for the federal government and having made some rookie publishing mistakes, it's been my experience that people with more money to waste on something end up wasting that money.  It's just harder to make prudent financial decisions when the consequences for mistakes are not that high.<br/><br/>(This is not meant as a condemnation of this thread, Ralph.  I'm just saying that, if your hypothetical situation were real, I'd still run the other way.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235284/#Comment_235284" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T15:11:41+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  3:11PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probably also in the art camp.

I'd actually probably spend it on marketing by hiring somebody to plan and execute some useful marketing for the product, that being my weakest point. Or I'd keep it and claim that it "motivates" me to work harder or something.<br/><br/>$10,000 would do nothing, either. If getting the money were dependent on me prioritizing some project or something, then we might say that the money would hasten my schedule. I'm actually in this very situation with my 9000 \u20ac game design grant right now, and it's a bitch: instead of doing whatever I want, I have to work on the specific project to fulfill the grant project. If the grant didn't require me to actually finish the game, it would progress much slower, or I'd work on other projects instead.<br/><br/>$100.000 would make me jump, but the way I'd jump would depend on what the benefactor wanted - left to my own devices I'd just pocket the money and continue working on my own schedule on my own projects. Significantly this wouldn't cause much impact on my production quality or anything like that - it makes no sense to me to invest in unsustainable production gloss that won't pay the investment back. Makes more sense to pay myself a salary and keep the money. I also might do some well-considered marketing endeavours - perhaps start my own rpg tv show or something like that.<br/><br/>The culturally best way for me to invest this sort of capital would be to disperse it in smaller cuts to beginning designers with easy loan conditions. Money is not a factor in the plans of established indie designers, but even modest amounts can motivate beginning authors to great deeds. So probably I'd start one of those crazy rpg design contests like the Ronnies, where I'd get to offend people and give them money for writing games I like.<br/><br/>Probably the reason for why so many of us wouldn't do anything interesting with that sort of money is that our processes have been developed to not require or have an use for such influxes of extra capital. My answer might be quite different if I routinely overspent on production quality or print runs or dreamed of doing so. Then I'd already have a plan for how to use such money. I don't know if that'd be any better than giving the money to myself, though.

For example:<br/><br/>- subsidize local groups in your social network renting nice quiet-ish spaces for weeknight gaming<br/>- childcare for weeknight groups<br/>- more one-day weekend cons like JiffyCon (making it easier to rent nicer space and secure childcare)<br/><br/>Actually, investing more money into your local minicons seems interesting.

It is already completed in Swedish.<br/><br/>H\xf6stdimma (Autumn mist) is a game that bridges the trad and indie styles of games. Use it to ease trad players into indie-gaming or vice versa. It is a traditional GM + players game, where players are handed some controll over things that usually are in the GM's domain. <br/><br/>The setting is fantasy 18th century post apocalyptic agent action. Think Brotherhood of the Wolf with the Three Musketeers in the lead and a hint of Final Fantasy. The Swedish release is 150 pages 6x9.<br/><br/>Money would go to proof-reading if I translate myself or proper translation if I can find it, paying the artist for using the illustrations in another project, editing, a full colour cover instead of the B/W one the game uses now.<br/><br/>I think I can do the project under budget, if there is $400 left I will release the game for free download and provide at-cost printing through Lulu.  If less than $400 I will hand the remains back to the community in a similar challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235597/#Comment_235597" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T05:26:17+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  5:26AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting angle Simon.

I do think I want to make games that use minis, because I think minis are awesome ( I'm perfectly content to play games that have no point of minis use, however).<br/><br/>The thing is, trying to show other folks what I've done is a PITA. really, unless you happen to be someone actually playing with me, some of the stuff, the fun, the craic, doesn't come through in write-ups. Not even if I add pics.<br/><br/>And, frankly, since it involves minis and sometimes fairly strange combinations of minis that folks aren't likely to already have, it would be equally unlikely for even an interested person to go out, collect everything I used ( or close to it) and have a go at it.<br/><br/>OTOH, for a grand, I could put together 10 or so different game kits, complete enough to play with and ship them off to ten different interested groups to try out, no risk, provided they agree to a couple of conditions ( honor system):<br/>1) They'll play the game within a month of receiving it or touch base and put it back out for other people to try.<br/><br/>2) They'll add something to the kit.<br/><br/>Something for the game would be nice, but just some pixs of themselves and the group that played it and feedback would work too.<br/><br/>3) They'll pay shipping to someone else whose group wants to have a go at it after 30 days and who will agree to follow these rules.<br/><br/>I'd just co-ordinate the thing through a simple Yahoo group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235814/#Comment_235814" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T19:20:57+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  7:20PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, I'm not sure how you interpreted my post that way but I wish you luck in dealing with whatever issues it brought up for you.

(You can search the Forge for the details, if interested.) The game's currently in design and has been since 2006 or so; I already have a grant for the writing and art, but more money never hurt anyone. Most significantly, the current publication plan concerns only a Finnish edition of the game. I don't say that I won't make an English edition even without an extra grant, but a $1000 would make a translation nicely worthwhile. The game is supposed to be finished next year, ideally in spring; plenty of time to translate it as well through the summer.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Damn, no.

While I have been able to do "paper tests" by making up PCs and Packages and Templates and estimating how they fare relative to each other (for cost balancing), there is nothing as effective as having 30 to 50 people make characters for a weekend-long game (or series of games) and actually fighting and throwing packets and <i>using</i> the system. And breaking it, so I can fix the unbalanced bits.<br/><br/>So what I propose is simple, really: I would host at least two and up to five weekend events, in my area (unless hosted elsewhere and within 8 hours drive) at which all expenses other than food are covered by me (and that $1000). These events would be open to both new and experienced LARPers, and I would focus on testing a different genre interpretation each event, perhaps with a Rift-like multi-genre setting or just by re-casting characters into the genre's color (GLASS <i>is</i> a generic system, so most Abilities should translate to an appropriate counterpart, from genre to genre). The short list would begin with high fantasy, then do modern horror, followed by post-apocalypse. If I have spare funds, I'd really enjoy doing a Neolithic game and a "Dangerous Liaisons" style of game. <br/><br/>So, then, you see that--at a BARE minimum--a few score people would enjoy fun weekends, being out in the sun and rain, getting exercise with full-speed combat (safe weapons), and stretching their improv legs. And at the end of the process, the world will have something I have not yet seen commercialized: a LARP system that is both simple and flexible and which, therefore, allows for fast convention play prep (due to common rules) and easily managed Living Worlds for traveling LARPers (i.e. you could have a single character in multiple games with different hosts that you attend throughout the year). The LARP community seems to develop for one of two extremes: laundry lists of genre-bound effects with considerable handling, resource, and verbal requirements that leave new players totally lost... or non-structured freeforms or minimal rulesets that essentially codify improv practices or Pass The Stick. GLASS offers simple techniques and rules to provide emergent complexity for simulating almost anything that you can't just do (e.g. pick a lock) while not trying to simulate that which folks can barely imagine (e.g. the tactical information and increased defensibility available when in flight).<br/><br/>I anticipate as many scenario-play paintball and Airsoft players as SCA and boffer LARP players, in my final market; and I intend to aggressively market to both of those hobby groups. I have also recently considered GLASS's applications for Serious Gaming, but I doubt that emergency responders and the like require as much structure for training (i.e. they need props and actors, not systems and abstractions). But it's still a thought, perhaps something I'd design as "modules," hiding GLASS under the hood, so to speak.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to apply!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235937/#Comment_235937" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T11:38:52+00:00" title="October  6, 2009 11:38AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite><br/>If that were the case, I wouldn't have offered.</blockquote>\nHowever, how do we know that you're offering in full consideration and out of worthy motives?

It's got all of the human, falliable relationship stuff that's important to my enjoyment of characterization, as well as the enjoyment of spy stories like the afore-mentioned television show as well as things like the Jason Bourne movies and <i>Spy Games.</i> I'm pretty proud of the Momentum mechanic, which works in a way I kind of always wished Exalted successes worked (when you win, you win gloriously, when you fail, you fail gloriously). It's important to me that the book be a wonderful thing to hold in your hands, and that the book is a strong source of reference for more than just the game's mechanics: I want to include a bunch of "spy" information, as well as a full glossary of important vocab (for instance, the names of all the major analogues to the CIA in the world, as well as other organizations, and the lingo used within them) so that people can feel like they're badass spies right out of the box.<br/><br/>The $1000 would go to a few different things. First of all, art: I'm doing a full-color book with gorgeous photography. My goal is for the photography to be mostly, if not all, produced by women, and for the art to skew subtly towards sexy, badass depictions of men in danger and non-slutty, sexy-because-they're-badass girls saving the day. (Some people are doing similar things with fantasy, but the spy genre continues to be male-dominated, both with authors and depictions of successful spy characters. The closest I can think of are slutty, badass archaeologists, which isn't quite the same thing.) Having more money would give me the flexibility to be choosier about my art, and commission pieces from female photographers I admire instead of relying completely on already-existing stock.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I'm fascinated and excited by the idea of utilizing technology in ways to make my games more accessible and to enhance the play experience, both face to face and for online play. I'd use a portion of the money on an iPhone developer kit, to allow me to create play aids for the iPhone-- I enjoy games with boardgamey and other chart-type elements, and so there's a good chance that <i>Blowback</i> will utilize something along those lines. If not, access to the diagrams, character dossiers you can fill in, save, and transfer to other phones alone would make gaming on the go easier. <br/><br/>Finally, I'd be remiss in taking that much money from the community without giving back. I'd be willing to distribute iPhone applications for other designers through the SDK I would purchase with the money, and also start a new blog which would outline all of the successes and failures of designing a game with the $1000 budget, as well as something that's been really hard to find out in public lately: hard numbers. I will talk about deals I find, money I blow, things that paid for themselves and mistakes I never should have made. We can see if Jonathan's right that someone with a bunch of money to blow on a game would just waste the money, and what can be done with $1000 no strings attached. I will be no-holds-barred honest, keep a running total, and a countdown to my deadline. My hope would be that other people would learn from my experiences, and good discussions could arise about some of the choices I make that would help us all. And even if the game turns out to be no fun, the information gathered would be worth the cash.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Except the game will be fun. Because I've played it and it's fun already. So really, win win.<br/><br/>Thanks for doing this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235986/#Comment_235986" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T16:58:48+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  4:58PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just because it seems weird.<br/><br/>Ralph didn't ask what you'd do with $1k or $10k.

I also like all kinds of dirty-hippy mechanics in games. I\u2019m convinced these kinds of things can go together. Unfortunately, you can only go so far describing this stuff online or in rules write-ups. To see the thing actually function, you need to be able to bust out some toys and have a go at it. And that\u2019s where things tend to reach a stopping point. Unless one of the interested readers also has a biggish minis collection and a willingness to hack together a scenario, everything is left as purely theoretical online ponderings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have solid test of the concept, my <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9426&amp;page=1#Item_26" rel="nofollow">Low Budget Mexican Horror Film Game</a> that says those things can go together successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also own a few thousand dollars worth of miniatures of different kinds already.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy idea is that I put together small, one-shot games like Maladicion as kits. Each kit is a unique game that I\u2019ve scratch built, and includes everything you need to play. That means all the terrain, all the minis, and any special widgets I\u2019ve made for use with that particular game. Maybe dice, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Here\u2019s the kicker</b>: I don\u2019t plan to sell these kits at all. Instead, I want to mail them off to folks (at my expense) who are interested and want to try them out. A recipient would need to agree to a couple of conditions to get a game from me:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>They can only keep the game kit for up to 30 days after receiving it. </i><br/>\nAfter that, they need to either mail it to another person on a list of interested parties, or back to me ( optimally, none would ever return to me, instead going onward like an Amish Friendship Bread batter starter). Tracking and insurance would be required.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>They have to add something to the game. </i><br/>\nIt could be a hack for another game system using stuff from the kit, it could be extra physical add-ins if they\u2019ve got some, it could be an upgrade of the minis and terrain if that\u2019s where their talents lie. Or, it could just be some pics of themselves and their game group trying the thing out and a bit about themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019d run the whole through a simple freebie site like a Yahoo group and just let things spread by word of mouth.<br/>\nThe site would be used to house info on the different kits available, including any add-ons in electronic format, and be a contact point for folks to get in on this game trying and trading project. I\u2019d add a donation button along the way for folks who wanted to see the project continue or expand, and I would add regular disclosure of how any donations were spent to further the project.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What $1,000 would do</b><br/>\n<i>It would let me make full kits.</i><br/>\nI already own the vast bulk of the miniatures that would be used. The rest of the money would be spent to make simple terrain and board pieces, as that\u2019s the sort of stuff that would need to be created to go with the minis to complete the set up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>It would pay for shipping to the first set of recipients.</i><br/>\nAs folks pass it along, that end would be covered as it went.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>It would give me enough money to take the initial risk and send this stuff off to give it a whirl.</i><br/>\nHey, I'm a blue-collar guy. This stuff was pricey for me to create. If I should fall flat on my face with this experiment, I'd like to fall a little less hard out of the gate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scale of project:</b><br/>\nIn addition to the complete Maladicion  braunstein, I have three near complete one-shot scenario games on the back burner, and another  four or so in less developed forms. By the beginning of January 2010 (or sooner), I could have all of those kits ready to ship, and the Yahoo group ready to fly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the initial send-out proves successful, I\u2019ll just keep adding to it on my own. I already buy and complete minis  and create these scenarios for my own pleasure, and those would get added on as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, as participants try these things out, they\u2019ll decide to have a go at making their own kits and putting them up at the site for sharing as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike David Artman\u2019s idea, this is essentially a non-profit venture designed to share a kind of gaming I like with other people who may be interested in experimenting with it, but who have not had the time or budget to try it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236017/#Comment_236017" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T19:30:33+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  7:30PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2009 3:14AM by Seth Drebitko.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok here we gooo!<br>\n  I want to have Ad Infinitum (my generic Sci-Fi game) completed along with a supplement by next year.

I'd probably split the budget down the middle, plough $500 into art and retain the other $500 for the initial print run and web advertising through likely-looking venues, postage for review copies and the like.

But behind the facade of perfection, its culture is stagnating. The governor of the city, known almost universally as 'the Gray Man', is obsessed with controlling every aspect of his city and its inhabitants. People are taught what the government decrees, take the jobs they are told to, wear only the clothing that the state deems appropriate. They listen to government music (bland) watch government movies (soulless), even sport has been subtly adjusted to remove any sense of competition. Because it upsets people when they lose. And when people get too upset, they tend to disappear. Stifled under this torrent of laws and regulations, the city's culture is crumbling away to nothing.<br><br>Enter the rebels (who still need a good name, but I'm working on it!) This illegal group oppose the government not with violence, but with style. They organise parties playing illegal music, they spray graffiti on every wall they can reach, they leap from rooftop to rooftop pulling crazy stunts while they do so, anything to get people's attention and spread their message. The laws must stop. But they never kill anyone, for all that the government call them terrorists. Where's the victory in killing some mother's son? It only turns the people against you, and it's the hearts of the people that they have to win. So when the authorities turn up to arrest them, they run. And they've gotten good at running. Almost supernaturally good. Which is lucky because some of the things coming after them don't look too human either.

If it just ends up on Lulu of course it'll be available about a week after it's finished when I've checked a proof copy, but it'd be nice to get this one into print.<br><br>-Ash                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236523/#Comment_236523" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T05:48:10+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  5:48AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In reply to Ralph's OP, skipping most of the thread...<br><br>I'd spend those $1000 to pay token fees to about 50 people for playtesting my game.

Succeed or fail, you're on your own.</blockquote>\nAwesome initiative, Lester.<br/><br/>I'm interested in putting that $1000 towards Heart of Ashes, a fantasy game that blends elements of dark, fairytale and young adult fantasy.<br/>I've already designed it and playtested it 4 times. I'm interested in developing it and publishing it.<br/><br/>Setting/Situation:<br/>You're children, who stumbled into another world, a strange and magical world (for now, let's just call it Place). Place endured a magical apocalypse long ago, at the hands of Seven Flames. Most people lost the ability to cast magic - strangely, you enter Place finding yourself capable of it. That sounds great, except... there are rumours that Seven Flames will return soon, to finish what he started. The Torches, his cult, grow in number. The Savant Guard, an elite task force of mages, have declared a state of emergency. Ribbon Fox has rallied a militia to protest the Guard's curfews and codes. Tensions are rising, danger is blooming. And suddenly in walk these children, from far away, who can do strange magic (aka, you). And these adults could really use your power. They are greedy, power-hungry and desperate. You just want to go home... but it's not that easy.<br/><br/>Design Goals:<br/>Create a fantasy game about children and adults, where danger and fear and greed and corruption are real and immediate. Design the game for both adults and children (ages 12+), being unafraid to use big words, introduce meaningful concepts and challenge them with ethical dilemmas. Have the game support exploratory play (witnessing this fantastical world in all its glory and lurking horror) and also real, biting decision making.<br/><br/>System: \n<ul><li>Uses a simple conflict resolution system, at its core (roll skill+3d6, versus a GM doing the same)</li>\n<li>introduces Risk Dice (functionally, the same as Exhaustion Dice in don't rest your head), which give you stronger dice now but might spiral out of control...</li>\n<li>gameplay is divided into Shadows (volatile situations), and if your Risk (dice) exceeds your Threshold, the Shadow falls on you. If the shadow was "Vampiric assassins are stalking the village", then the Shadow falling might mean that they capture you, or turn you into a Vampire, or turn the mayor into a Vampire...</li>\n<li>Magic powers (discreet powers bought like D&amp;D4E Powers, SOTC Stunts or TSOY Secrets) are fuelled by gaining Risk Dice as well, making the use of magic a difficult choice with serious potential consequences.</li>\n<li>Situations (and NPCs) are introduced alongside Antagonistic Keys. If someone buys the Antagonistic Key, that situation or NPC becomes an ongoing part of the story (and that player gains XP for interacting with it). If not, it's a one off encounter. Explicit, mechanically-rewarded flags that create ongoing situations and generate character development!</li>\n</ul>\nAntagonistic Keys - An example<br/><b>Key of Troll-Thing </b><br/><i>Troll-Thing is a monster with many eyes, and a propensity to confuse unrequited love with the necessity for violence. </i><br/>Gain XP whenever you: seek out Troll-Thing; offend or enrage it; attempt to help it; take pity on it; show it affection. <br/>Buyoff: Escape Troll-Thing, and its love, for good.<br/><br/><b>Publication Plan / Budget</b><br/>$1000 is a perfect amount to publish this game. Let me break it down:<br/><br/>I want to offer the core rules of the game (along with GM &amp; player advice) in a free PDF, but also sell it as a book through Lulu (paperback).<br/>The pdf/book would explain the rules concisely, include lots of context and advice for using the pieces of the system (why they exist, how to generate good stories with them), and advice and examples for how the GM can introduce &amp; play their situations and NPCs.<br/><br/>The coolest part of the game for me, in all three sessions, is the idea of cycling through monsters, groups, leaders and situations... partially because there's cool stuff there, but largely because I'm sharing with the players what interests me, and they're responding with the directions they want to go. Antagonistic Keys are a clear way of saying "THESE! These things are working for me. Weave them together and put them at odds and involve us in THIS."<br/><br/>But that's potentially a lot of monsters, groups, leaders and situations (from here on in, I'll collectively call these: SPLATS). The crux of the publication model would be releasing these splats in an ongoing way, in a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10659&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">webcomic format</a>. Each week, perhaps even twice a week, I'd release another splat. So one week you might get Vampiric Assassins, the next you might get Troll-Thing, the next you might get The Weaver's Circle, and the next you might get the Village of Tinyfeet.<br/><br/>I have two artists lined up, both friends of mine who are enthusiastic to work on the project (and interested in working for cheap).<br/>$300 to each of them.<br/>$100 for editing of the main book.<br/>$150 for layout of the book and the website.<br/>I don't know how much it takes to host a site like I'm envisioning, but I'm going to estimate $100 right now.<br/><br/>The hard copy books would be printed through Lulu, which eliminates the need for stock... but the remaining $50 would go towards buying several copies that I could take to conventions with me and sell.<br/><br/>I'd personally cover additional costs out-of-pocket, if stuff came up (if website hosting is exponentially more than that... if I wanted to create cards or fliers...)<br/><br/>Since I'd be funded, I'd have no need to make back investments.<br/>Thus, I'd be able to offer the game as a free PDF with ongoing free updates, published like a weekly webcomic (featuring colour art).<br/>Selling the book would allow people to show their fandom/support, and put a little money into my pocket (bonus!)<br/><br/>If I've misunderstood your offer and you actually want that $1000 earned back over time, I have an altered version of this which includes some more solid profit generation. Though I think you are talking about a flat-out grant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237609/#Comment_237609" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T20:21:22+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  8:21PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2009 8:21PM by Thunder_God.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, I think hosting is going to be considerably cheaper than that, unless you're not only envisioning, but expecting, thousands of visitors every month, and hosting the file only on your site, etc. (I suggest putting it on rapidshare/megaupload just in case), also, out of curiousity, for how long would you plan on releasing these weekly or bi-weekly SPLATS?

If all artwork (including page borders) was provided with little or no conversion to worry about, and the final book was less than 50 pages long with no bloody tables to do, I could probably do layout for $150. But then, I'm no specialist in the art.

It'd also help me take my mind off the impending bills associated with my mother, who has just recently been diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. Essentially this would enable me to continue working towards publishing, and really make publishing a game a realistic endeavour for me.<br/><br/>Submitted for your approval.<br/><br/>For the last two years, in what little spare time I have had, I have been working on a trilogy of interwoven projects, collectively known as <b>Gestalt</b>. Each of these games has been received well in my local circles, but time, motivation, and a few small hangups in design have kept the project from reaching its' zeitgeist as I'd hoped. <br/><br/>The game is a deeply introspective, immersion-focused take on how far people are willing to go to achieve their goals and fulfill obsessive desires. The game's structure emphasizes specific moments in a character's life which have become focal points of trauma. Play has a strong Shakespearian slant, with characters (and, by design, the players as well) slowly throwing their lives away to achieve their one perfect moment, then realizing how much has been lost in pursuit of an impossible dream. In its' final playtest, one of the players commented, "singlehandedly the best roleplaying experience I've had, and the first that seems somehow really <i>relevant</i> to how we live." <br/><br/>That notion of relevancy on a literary level is one of my two design goals; the other is to encourage an internal dialogue about one's priorities. In that respect, the game is synergistically engrossing and therapeutic, entertaining while encouraging catharsis. The secondary goal is to build a game model that, much like classical literature, inspires us to look at ourselves and strive towards something better.<br/><br/>In the last two years I have had several magnaminous artists, editors, and layout experts all graciously donate time and energy to help make my game designs something beautiful, and this thousand dollars would be all I'd need to compensate them fairly for all their hard work, and publish a short run of books for sale at conventions and online. I've done the math, and while I understand how big some folks think, $1000 wouldn't just be a help, it'd be a godsend, enough to fund the entire project's completion.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time, Lester.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237804/#Comment_237804" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T01:05:35+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  1:05AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Lester,<br/><br/>I'm working on a fantasy adventure RPG called Delve.  I'm definitely going to make it playable, concoct a nice cover, and publish it in some fashion.  There's one thing that I'd really LIKE to do, but don't have the money for: an in-fiction photo shoot.<br/><br/>The game's designed to enable and encourage a "seeing through your character's eyes" experience.  At the same time, I'm endeavoring to explain the game procedures (including meta-level stuff about group agreements and GM prep) in a way that's easy to immediately apprehend and reference.  My solution is:<br/>1) to use simple bullet points, cartoons and diagrams for the book's instructional sections, with no game-fiction flavor at all<br/>2) to use photos to depict the game fiction itself<br/><br/>I went to Ireland and got some great shots of old castles, but what I really need for my photos are player characters, NPCs, and medieval village structures.  Many parts of getting this together are cheap, but I think I'll need a professional photographer, some actors, and some props that'll cost money.  I'd also need to consult with a photographer who's expert in Photoshop to go over the options for photoshopping the people into my Ireland shots.  I would think that $1000 would be enough to do it as well as it can be done (well, as well as it can be done for less than $20,000).<br/><br/>As for the game itself, Delve is a fantasy adventure game of exploration and discovery of how the supernatural works.  The GM throws out leads, promises, and hooks, and the players pursue whichever ones they want.  I have a system that fixes the biggest historical problem with genuine attempts at RPG sandboxing, that being GM overwork.  Basically, Delve does the thing that all the gamers I know tried to do with AD&amp;D 2 &amp; 3.<br/><br/>I've got some bits and pieces online <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you wanna take a peek.
