And, regardless of the validity of the argument he did raise an interesting thought: what is the point of DW? He suggested the point is "being bold." While I definitely agree with the being bold, it is more about doing so as a party. In this light I think perhaps one of the fundamental problems we have been having with the advancement mechanisms is that they are all focused on the individual players, and not the party as a whole. <br/><br/>In this idea I propose eliminating the current advancement system with one that rewards the whole party.<br/><br/>First, drop the advancement for alignment and bonds. Instead, when you could mark XP for either instead carry +1 forward.<br/><br/>Second, as a replacement for highlighted stats come up with a party agenda. The agenda would contain different adventuring aspects, the players would highlight an aspect, and the GM would highlight another.<br/><br/>The list would including things like:<br/><br/>- Bloodlust (when your party routes the adversaries in an area, mark xp)<br/>- Loot<br/>- Investigation<br/>- Exploration<br/>- Infliltration<br/>- Etc...<br/><br/>Whenever the party hits the trigger for the aspect everyone would mark xp. Additionally, the amount of XP would be relative to the difficulty of the trigger. So, if it was easy, mark 1, if it was challenging mark 5, if it took the party to their limits mark 10. <br/><br/>I would set the level advancement at 50 xp (10 challenging encounters). And, to compensate for lower level members there would be an underdog clause that allowed members below the party level to count the triggers as one difficulty level higher (nothing granting more than 10xp).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344455/#Comment_344455" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T16:47:17+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  4:47PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is definitely an interesting idea.

One of the problems I've always had with individual XP advancement mechanisms is that it tends to reward spotlight hogs. I'm wondering if we might be better off sticking to an currency like +1 forward that rewards the initiative but does not put you at a material advantage over your party mates?<br/><br/>What might be interesting would be a "shooting the moon" mechanic. Sure, you let someone steal the spotlight for a bit and regardless of the outcome, everyone ELSE marks XP for it. I don't know if that would be fun, or what kind of behavior it would be encouraging, but it is definitely different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344475/#Comment_344475" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T19:27:22+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  7:27PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite><br/>What might be interesting would be a "shooting the moon" mechanic.

I've always liked group XP in D&amp;D, it took the competition out of it and supported working, loosly, as a team.  The question is what would trigger it?  Would you highlight stats and when you roll that stat everyone else gets XP - that would fit with others highlighting your stats (It would also hold with AW mechanisms).  It could also trigger some social rewards because, you know, when you get me XP for doing something awesome - high five!

That's okay, we can all still play.  We have our own characters.) and for each character to be their own unique unit.<br/><br/>To me, what party advancement might bring to the table is a sense of voltronicity.  Which is a word that I just made up.  To describe the feeling that, while each individual component of the party is unique and cool on their own, they combine to form something that is bigger and cooler than all of them could be alone.<br/><br/>There's tension, power and risk involved in partying up - I'd like to find a way to show that mechanically in the game while supporting the idea that the more you work with your dungeoneering "buddies" the better you all get at working together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345294/#Comment_345294" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T09:42:58+00:00" title="October  8, 2011  9:42AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear, I think party advancement is a nifty idea and I don't think it's worth keeping individual advancement for the sake of preserving PC-PC competition.

As hard and irrevocable as the DM likes, here.<br/><br/>The interesting part will come from leading with the fiction- just what are the fictional requirements that must be fulfilled to allow you to cheat death?
