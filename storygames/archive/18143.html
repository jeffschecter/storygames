So let me lead off with what I'm <i>not</i> saying:<br/><br/>I am <i>not</i> saying that every roleplayer must choose between:<br/>(a) getting into their character's head and acting out everything that character would do, regardless of any other concerns (like enjoyment of other players)<br/>(b) using their character to do whatever "works best for the story" with zero sense of any ongoing character identity<br/><br/>I am <i>not</i> saying that.<br/><br/>What I <i>do</i> want to say is that I've felt a tension between two competing desires when I play.  These are, roughly, the desire to fully explore an established character, and the desire to responsively engineer resonant and engaging scenes.  Much as it's usually possible to do <i>some</i> degree of both at the same time, I find that it's rarely possible to <i>maximize</i> both at once.  Thus, tension.<br/><br/>How do <i>you</i> navigate this tension?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409674/#Comment_409674" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T06:49:19+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  6:49AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 6:55AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an example:<br/><br/>My Monsterhearts character Amun is attempting to forsake his infernal dark power in favor of the "Lynx Force" that gives power to Sage, the witch he has a crush on.  Amun wants to be on the winning team, and, due to getting his ass kicked by Sage's powers, he figures her team is it.  Now, Amun's ex-girlfriend Lavender is the key to various factions' schemes -- her continued existence is holding open a portal, which allows the infernal dark power, among others, to exert influence into the mundane world.  The only faction who wants this portal closed is Sage and the witches.  Amun decides, in the grandiose and bloodthirsty way that embodies him, to kill Lavender, as quickly and thoroughly as possible.<br/><br/>As it happens, the various player characters with an interest in Lavender (also a PC) converge in a hospital where the portal physically manifests, and Lavender rushes toward it.  Previous contact with the portal has demonstrated to the players that it will suck people through to some unknown "elsewhere".  Removing Lavender from earth would presumably remove the portal from earth too.  Dave knows this for sure.  Amun doesn't, and also doesn't particularly care, as he's intent on proving his usefulness to Sage and the Lynx Force with a dramatic action.<br/><br/>Dave rolls the dice and gets a level of success that allows me to inflict extra Harm, which will kill Lavender.  Everyone else at the table wants to see Lavender wounded but not killed, to give all the other present characters a chance to react and develop their own dramas.  Will the Chosen act to save a life, even if it means keeping the portal open?  Will Sage reveal her own secret intentions to the others by helping finish Lavender off?  Will Lavender reveal what she hopes to find on the other side of the portal?  Sounds like a great scene!<br/><br/>On the other hand, I have a very concrete vision for who Amun is.  He wants power, and wants it with a desperation that leads him to act impulsively and compromise himself in various ways.  Also, his idea of power is to be allied with someone powerful, and to earn their favor.  This kid is basically a needy little bastard trying to act like a badass, and his more positive emotions, like affection, are only triggered by those who can fit into that schema.  Amun is a specific sort of teenage misery engine, and a large part of my interest in Monsterhearts was in seeing how that would play out, in the context of the other characters.  Will the Witch adopt him as a worthy equal?  Will the Vampire take him as a subservient thrall?  Will the Chosen kill him to end his toxic behavior?  So if I <i>don't</i> find out what happens when "Amun kills Lavender because he can", then I'm not getting all of what I came here for.<br/><br/>The group's social contract offers some support for both decisions.  On the one hand, a hearty endorsement of Monsterhearts' "play to find out" ethos, and a general appreciation for rich characterization.  On the other hand, a helpful spirit of working to give each other opportunities to have fun and to shine.<br/><br/><b>Just to clarify:</b> I am <i>not</i> looking for solutions to this specific situation.  It's simply a recent example that I can remember in some detail.  I present it only in case it was unclear from my original post what I'm talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409675/#Comment_409675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T07:18:36+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  7:18AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it's a separation of bandwidth.

When I'd get worried is if this wasn't a one off for Amun, if he'd got a bit two dimensional by just always acting on a small subset of drivers. That's when the 'I was just playing my character' argument falls apart for me and becomes 'I'm not being an arse, honest'. I'm not saying that's what we're talking about here. Just clarifying. I don't think anyone would ever 'only do X in this situation' people are far too complicated for that. Could the issue be that you're not happy surprising yourself with what your character could do and so are always looking for Meta reasons for it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409680/#Comment_409680" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T07:42:34+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  7:42AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Postscript: it seems I just took the opportunity to free-associate about the topic here - it's probably because you opened the thread so widely. The following doesn't really have a central point, I'm just musing randomly. Perhaps there's something interesting there.<br/><br/>For me this is a game design question. Different games handle this tension in different ways, and I switch games like a wine connosseur looking for variety. In some games it's a valid play to play either way, while in others individual players should always look out for number one, and there are mechanics or other players tasked with dramatic concerns. Of course in many games these issues are left to methodology, in which case we could talk about how a given person or group plays a given game. A game can also be crafted in a way that causes this issue to not apply at all.<br/><br/>This is mainly a feature of games that rely on players to both advocate for their characters and coordinate drama, without distinguishing between these tasks explicitly. To pick an example very familiar to myself, TSoY is vulnerable to this conflict if the Story Guide plays relatively hands-off and relies on the players to frame scenes. If the Story Guide's technique is more dedicated to carrying the dramatic coordination burden, then the players never need to worry about it, and they know that they can do whatever is right for their character, relying on the SG to spin the consequences. The difference between these modes of play isn't really in the rules (although I chose to write the SS version of the text to clearly advocate for a strongly drama-coordinating Story Guide), but merely in how the group construes the GM/player task division in practice.<br/><br/>But anyway, yes: this is an issue in roleplaying, a basic question for design. Overall my own favourite solution tends to be walling off these responsibilities clearly: let somebody else worry about the dramatic tension, I worry about depicting my character correctly. This has the not insignificant advantage of resulting in genuine, raw drama where it is almost logically impossible to fail by undermining the integrity of your central characters. Works well for psychological drama, which is almost all modern drama in one way or another.<br/><br/>(I should clarify that it is, of course, possible to fail in dramatic characterization even if players are explicitly freed from worrying about dramatic conceits. The most common failure in my experience is that the player doesn't know how to construe who his character is, or doesn't know how to show this to the other players so they can appreciate it. This is part of the reason for why I say that character advocacy properly consists of two parts: decide what your character wants, and show it to the other players.)<br/><br/>This conflict between external (plot-concerned) and internal (character-concerned) construction of drama is a reason I don't like Houses of the Blooded and other similar games: they explicitly suborn character advocacy to dramatic concerns. All players are supposed to be thinking about the story, basically writing it in advance, and then making moves that are "good for the story", so that there is no particular guarantee that anybody would be caring about what the character wants. From my viewpoint this is not desirable, as I want to be playing to see what the story is like, or even whether there is any story. A game that tells me that I should "fake" the events of the game and force them to go against their natural course merely to fulfill a preconceived dramatic need doesn't sit well with me. For me, the game is almost always better if you show clearly who the character is, and let the story be about that, instead of first figuring out what the story is about and then changing the character to fit.<br/><br/>To apply this to your example Monsterhearts game, the question I would have to ask as a participant would be: how do you know that having Lavender live would be the most interesting outcome? The action might tug the carpet from under other players' feet, the ones who relied on Lavender for their stories, but that's where you need to make your artistic priorities clear: are you in it for the raw, unexpected, fair chaos of creative gaming, or is it important for you to have the game be safe and respectful of the notions of each individual player equally? Is it cool for the events of the game to surprise you, or should the events follow the storyline you chose in advance? For myself it's almost always that first one I want, so I'd go with the character integrity and rely on the creative processes of the game to lead us towards interesting consequences.<br/><br/>To clarify, there's nothing wrong with playing a game where people respect each other's planned storylines, either. I personally dislike this, that sort of forum game sensibility bores me. It is, however, entirely possible to design games that provide explicit plot protection of various sorts. The crudest are the forum games where you're not allowed to "god-mode" or make changes to NPCs introduced by other players or do anything to another player's character without permission or... the list goes on, because effectively the creative desire is to enable each player to have maximal control over their own sandbox, while allowing them to deside for themselves how their own personal piece of the fiction interact with the rest of it.<br/><br/>However, leaving aside this extreme, there's plenty of respectable gaming out there that desires players to have dramatic coordination powers and responsibilities. Monsterhearts might be one, I don't know - haven't read or played it. Point-buy systems are usually like this, as is FATE most of the time.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409681/#Comment_409681" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T08:04:13+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  8:04AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew and w00hoo, to me it sounds like you're saying, "Do what's fun for the game, because you really can then make it fit with the character!"

Think ahead. What themes, types of stories and types of scenes is the story likely to engage with and how do I create a character that works with that. Not just works with but further that kind of play. But, you can't see the future so this is mostly about guess work.<br/><br/>2. I communicate with my fellow players. "<i>Hey. My character is going this direction, which kind of sucks. Could you help me push things in another direction instead?"</i> If the characters internal motivation don't take them in the best direction at the moment, outside help often works like magic. Someone might say. <i>"Oh. I know exactly what to do!" </i>and comes up with a devilish plan to get you on track again.<br/><br/>3. I see to that my character fails. My character might be very motivated to do X, but they can always fail. I had a very violent character that often wanted to kill other PC. Somehow, when a fight got serious, I always saw to that she ended up losing the fight, or getting hurt, or by mistake let the other PC escape.<br/><br/>4. I see to what alternative paths I can take. Perhaps the obvious thing for my character to do is X, but that would suck. Without changing my character feelings and motivations I look to a less obvious path to take motivated by the same feelings and emotions. <i>"The obvious thing would be to kill you, but instead I'll make you life hell. Bwahahahah!"</i> I might have to think of a reason why not to do the obvious thing, but often a simple reason can be found, like being afraid to fail.<br/><br/>5. I wait. This one is surprisingly effective. Just stall a little, and a new situation and solution will arise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409703/#Comment_409703" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T09:07:30+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  9:07AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a GM'd game I tend to go for it and let the GM worry about the problems it's causing (that's why they earn the big bucks, right?) <br/><br/>So playing the Slayer in a Buffy game I've waltzed past smaller monsters going for the big kill and leaving potentially fatal consequences for my white hats behind me because 'that's what she does'. I like to think I play her consistently enough that it's not a surprise. I also like talking about the game so will discuss things (especially if cliff hangers have been left) with the GM and other players between sessions so that it's not unexpected how she'll act. On a couple of times I've chosen to go soft on the Big Bad because it was story appropriate (not going for the Drama Pointed instakill option when it was there) and I've not been unhappy with that. I've found myself able to reason for why it happened in character (generally being somewhere else saving someone who was actually dying and the like).<br/><br/>Without a GM I tend to look to the story requirements more even when playing up the character.<br/><br/>For instance in a recent game of Ribbon Drive I'd ended up playing the very high maintenance girlfriend of one of the other characters in the car (I don't play against gender every time, only for examples it seems) and about 45 minutes in realised that I wasn't creating any positive reason for him to be with her. I was fully in character, but I was exploring all of the negatives and so made a conscious decision to play up some positives for a bit to make her presence more comprehendable. I was happy doing that and didn't feel that I was being untrue to the character because we knew the two of them were so in love that her spending all their savings on prescription meds and causing their eviction wasn't enough to split them up. I just hadn't shown why up to that point.<br/><br/>Do they make sense with what you're looking for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409705/#Comment_409705" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T09:14:40+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  9:14AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there is a distinction between what the character tries to do in the fiction and the mechanical result. You know? Like, after your roll, you <b>as a player </b>had the power to determine whether Amun's attack would be lethal, but from Amun's point of view, his action was identical. All, Amun knows is that he going in for the kill. I make compromises like that to reconcile this kind of issue all the time. <br/><br/>For example, I was playing AW last night, and my character, Halloween, was walking through the ruins of an inner city park. The MC made a custom move that resulted in me choosing between finding a dangerous path to my destination (a bridge over the Pink River on the other side of the ruins) or a safe road to local settlement. Given the choice, Halloween would have picked the path to the bridge FOR SURE. But, he wasn't given the choice. I was. And, I wanted Halloween to meet an urban tribe living in a city park. So, that's what happened, and he was never the wiser about the chance to escape the ruins. <br/><br/>This is an interesting issue. In games where you as a player have no idea what the outcome will be to your character's actions, your actions and the character actions are aligned. If you have some say in the outcome, it means that you are making two choices -- one for the character and one as a player with limited authority over the story.

You can definitely shift between making choices from a character POV and makes choices as some kind of external narrator/author/framer, but doing so fluidly can be difficult sometimes where there's no social or mechanical cues on what viewpoint you should be taking when making decisions. I think I tend to default to something close to Eero, but it really depends on the game and my role in it, right? As a GM, I'm often called to consider things both from a character perspective and from a broader perspective of scenes and issues and factions. When I'm acting as a player in a GM'd game, I often tend to do some of both, even when my job is just to play my character. And in GMless games, often everyone has to keep an eye on both or at least take turns being the one to frame scenes or take a broader narrative perspective.<br/><br/>I guess my question is: why maximize? This tension is one of the essential aspects of roleplaying, yeah? Navigating between different perspectives is one of the essential joins and pains of trying to craft a great play experience. Are there benefits to necessarily being all-in on one side or the other? Surely there are just as many benefits for switching between perspectives at different moments in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409707/#Comment_409707" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T09:20:16+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  9:20AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 9:25AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, AMBayard, I kinda hate my example for introducing that confounding element.

(which is a totally arrogant conceit I will admit).  So in Polaris, I will go for embodiment actions if it leads to my Knight's downfall, but will instead flip to "story centric" actions if it leads to my Knight's downfall.<br/><br/>A more clear example might be Kagematsu.

I see your tension, but I always have an easy out, a clear tie-breaker.   Only when the "in the moment, at the table" demands from the other players are strong will I buck the desire to do what I think the "game intends."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409716/#Comment_409716" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T09:50:21+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  9:50AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that as a player you definitely need to design your character differently for each kind of game. If the game has mechanics that may put one character against another, and the GM intends to use at least a few, don't make a team player character, nor a lone wolf cause the first won't have the tools (skills) to confront all situations, and the last won't have a reason to get involved in the story.<br/><br/>If on the other hand the game allows and encourages character specialization then you need to make your character's bonds with other PCs and NPCs way stronger, to save yourself, the GM and the rest of the players the need of wasting hours of gameplay in a struggle to find a motivation for your character. A D&amp;D party will usually have a better time stablishing from the beggining that they are all best friends/family/longtime comrades that usually go for adventures together and care for each other... or perhaps they will have loads of fun fighting each other until they manage to forge an everlasting friendship. However in the latter case, the GM can't expect the that main adventure will advance too much.<br/><br/>So you can say that it all comes to one question: What's the focus of the story you're into? - You can either worry about it before playing or when you get to cross that bridge, but you can't avoid it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409720/#Comment_409720" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T09:57:09+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  9:57AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 10:01AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lotsa good points here on priming the right ingredients so that the tension I described is less likely to come up.

In Monsterhearts, it <i>really</i> is two decisions.  The issue of the thread topic is probably clearer in a game where Amun's decision to fire automatically means Lavender will die, like my minimum damage is higher than her remaining hit points or some such.</blockquote>\nHmm. So, it seems like the issue is most significant under particular circumstances. <br/><br/>Case 1: Neither Amun in the fiction nor the player know the result of Amun's attack. It might kill and it might not. So, if Amun tries to kill, there is no real tension between playing the character and maximizing drama. It's out of the player's hands. <br/><br/>Case 2: Amun doesn't know if his attack will be successful, but the player <b>decide</b>s if it will be successful. Again, no real tension because Amun can be as hardcore as you want and the player can alter the story to maximize the drama. (Of course, "maximizing" drama seems like it could be pretty subjective and ambiguous since reasonable players could disagree about the <b>most</b> dramatic outcome. I think we're assuming for this discussion that everyone agrees a live Lavender is the most dramatic result.) <br/><br/>Case 3: Amun doesn't know if his attack will be successful, but the player <b>knows for sure </b>that it will. Now, there is tension because there is a story outcome the player wants that is foreclosed by what the character Amun wants. Hmmm . . . I don't know. I'd probably err on the side of following through with Amun's interests. Either way, it'd be an exciting moment at the table.

This is more part of an (often completely real) conflict between "what I as the player expect my character to do in this situation" and "what the rest of the table wants my character to do in this situation".  In other words, it's not your desires that are necessarily at issue - both the fiction and the system are saying "yes, do it, murder her, hahaha yes", it's that you feel the burden of aligning your desires with the outcome the rest of the players want.<br/><br/>This is not a false burden, among many groups, including my current one, there's palpable tension/disappointment when someone, say, goes too far with violence in a previously lighthearted game, or has not followed a plot point that really motivated or moved everyone else.  So you're not wrong about this.  But I would identify it as a social issue rather than a game design issue (though as I mentioned with respect to FATE and other games with personality/goal mechanics they may contribute to this if they are not flexible enough).  Either this is a group where we invest in each other's individual visions of character fidelity in the situation, and they agree to swallow their disappointment if you passionately charge after something they'd rather you didn't, or it's a group where we invest in some shared concept of how things will go collaboratively and you agree to swallow your disappointment if you have to hold back or concoct some justification for an action you feel is not true to the character/situation. <br/><br/>(By the way, this is why Primetime Adventures doesn't always succeed at producing great play despite being highly collaborative - because collaboration can and must lead to compromised desires.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409766/#Comment_409766" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T13:27:45+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  1:27PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 1:28PM by Callan_S.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>Just kill her.

(Whether I should have been doing that in Monsterhearts, in the way that I did, is clearly open to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/396354#Comment_396354" rel="nofollow">debate</a>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jlarke" title="jlarke"><img alt="jlarke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jlarke">jlarke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409776/#Comment_409776" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T14:12:33+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  2:12PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've felt torn in both directions and take my guidance from two things. In order of priority, they're implied social contract, and level of personal emotional identification with my character.<br/><br/>In my mind, social contract is normally fairly neutral on this topic, provided you aren't going out of your way to wreck someone else's fun. However, there are hints that come in. If I know this is the second to last session of the campaign, I'm utterly willing to identify with my character a little less if it brings the campaign toward a mutually satisfying ending. If I'm playing a troublesome character because the GM wanted me to help keep the pot boiling, I'm extra-willing to cause trouble.<br/><br/>If I don't feel like it's my place in the gaming group to go one direction or another, I check my emotional identification with the character at that moment. Do I, as a player, have a strong emotional reaction to the situation? If so, I'm going with it. In the 7th Sea game I'm currently in, I as a player have a definite sense of hate for one of the other PC's nemesis. My character has ample reason to loathe him as well. If that guy comes within sword range, I'm striking to kill. If someone has a problem with that, they can try and stop me. On the other hand, there have been plenty of situations where I knew my character would have a strong emotional reaction to a situation, but I myself just wasn't feeling it. In that situation I'll err on the side of identifying with the other players over identifying with my PC, or just straight out ask the table. It's not like I'd be breaking immersion - if I'm not feeling strongly about the situation, immersion's probably not happening anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409777/#Comment_409777" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T14:14:12+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  2:14PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Have you ever tried asking that question of your gaming group?

That's a good tension. As a player, I try to look for opportunities to make that happen and seize on them when they do.<br/><br/>In the example you're talking about, the other players have expectations about how the scene might play out in an interesting way. But they also have expectations about how you are playing your character as a power-seeking hothead with an opportunity to get ex-girlfriend vengeance and secure power at the same time.<br/><br/>So - lucky you - either thing you choose will succeed at both challenging and reinforcing the expectations of the other players.<br/><br/>If you choose murder, you get to challenge their expectations about how the scene will play out while reinforcing your characterization to a shocking new level (Murdering a former beloved for power puts you pretty heavily into villain territory, which is certainly an interesting development. And it gives the other players PLENTY to work with.)<br/><br/>If you choose mercy, you get to reinforce their conceptions about what else can happen in this dramatic scene while revealing that your character is a bit more complicated in his motivations than they may have thought. Maybe power isn't the only thing worth having after all. What good is having power if you destroy everyone you care about? Good meaty stuff there.<br/><br/>How fortunate for you to have such an embarrassment of riches in your choices, David!<br/><br/>"Oh! Do I choose this awesome, fun, interesting outcome, or that one?!

But it seems to me that this kind of tension is exactly where you -want- a conflict between PCs.  Player A/Character A strongly want to kill NPC X.  Players B, C, and D don't (however strongly; they also have other priorities) want NPC X killed, and nor do their characters.<br/><br/>It seems to me that this can play out one of two ways:<br/><br/>1. Player A/Character A either decide not to kill X on their own (avoiding conflict) or kill X in a way where B, C, and D cannot interfere (note: if they are aware of A's intention and are outmanuvered, well, that's just part of the game; I'm thinking of situations where they weren't even aware that they should be taking precautions if they want some control over this sort of thing.  Either A is deliberately soft peddling, or B, C, and D are disenfranchised without a good way of fighting back.<br/><br/>2. Conflict!  Player A directly opposes the other players in a fashion where they can fight back.  This means that either A gets what they want (but in a way that engages B, C, and D--and if they win, they validate that conflict whereas if they soft-peddled, they make it clear that it didn't really matter after all) or B, C, and D get what they want, and Player A, aside from going after what they want, is also serving a useful purpose of acting as opposition and a conflict driver for the other players.<br/><br/>In general, if the system allows it, I'm always going to choose 2. here.  If it doesn't, that's a good case for looking at why not.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410038/#Comment_410038" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T23:38:13+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 11:38PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm going to throw one more technique into the pot here:<br/><br/>Search for more fictional info that will change your character's reaction, nudging it toward what the group wants.<br/><br/>If I ask everyone, "Is anything happening that might give Amun a reason to change his mind about killing Lavender?" then maybe someone (like Sage's player) can think of something (like "Sage looks disgusted at Amun's bloodthirst").</blockquote>\nI think its just another technique for poisoning the well.
