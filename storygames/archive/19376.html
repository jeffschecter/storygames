(Our playtest game centred on the US Republican party after the 2012 election and was fascinating to play).<br/><br/>Looking at the finished game, I've finally figured out how to articulate something that I wanted to say after our playtest.<br/><br/>The game clearly spells out one of the creative rewards (for the real-life players) of playing Kingdom: you get to set up interesting Crossroads (choices and dilemmas that have powerful downsides and advantages) and see how they resolve. \n<blockquote>It\u2019s our job to make Crossroads that push the<br/>Kingdom and the characters into territory that <br/>interests us. Never make a Crossroad that doesn\u2019t<br/>interest you! You might even introduce a Crossroad<br/>that your character dreads, but that you think would<br/>be interesting.</blockquote>\nI've only had a chance to do one initial read of the final rules, but what I don't see is are incentives in the rules to set up these dilemmas. To me it looked like we can play the game and 'go easy' on each other. That wouldn't be an interesting game, but I'm not seeing where the rules are to help us make the choices in a Crossroad interesting/challenging.<br/><br/>I really want to play/facilitate Kingdom again, and I feel like I either need a better grip on this (or to figure out if I'm overlooking something obvious).<br/><br/>What am I missing, or what techniques do I need to encourage when I'm teaching the game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431531/#Comment_431531" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-24T01:02:55+00:00" title="April 24, 2014  1:02AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uhm.<br/>Aggressively pushing the "story" by putting tough choices in front of other players (or even oneself) feels like its own reward to me, and it's, like, one of the very basic core activities of playing the (role-playing) games I most enjoy.

If, if I use this game as an example, you don't like setting up dilemmas for your friends, don't play the game.

Be aware that (a) I might not have this right, and (b) I think it might be a distraction from the question I'm asking (but let's find out) \u2026<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b>: establishes the shared creative agenda early\u2014not only through the pitch but also through creating the setting via the playset you've all chosen. It then provides rules support by asking players to either frame a scene or determine if it resolves well or poorly.<br/><br/><b>Poison'd</b>: You play a crew of vipers whose ambitions and resentments all point at each other like loaded guns. Character creation firmly establishes the creative rewards for playing cutthroats and villains. In play, the rules help create interesting situations via Bargains, Ambitions and the option to endure duress (suffering defeats now and making your situation more complicated) in order to triumph later<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World</b>: Has its PC-NPC-PC triangles and a number of other MC tools to destabilise status quos.<br/><br/><b>Bliss Stage</b>: At the beginning of the game, you create a web of interesting and damaged relationships. The rules then continually ask you to choose which ones you want to damage least every time you go on a mission into the Bliss.<br/><br/><br/>What I might be missing in my reading of Kingdom is advice for how the abilities of different Roles (particularly the Perspective) can be used to make each Crossroad really meaty. I want to be able to contribute better to this thread, so I'll take another look at the rules over the next few days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431537/#Comment_431537" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-24T07:29:01+00:00" title="April 24, 2014  7:29AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I participated in the early playtest of Kingdom and I'd say the deal there is to tell the players in advance that the game mechanics have the virtue to turn any confrontational situation into a good story, and that setting their minds on some sort of teamwork or a non-confrontational situation will only result in a poor game that will end up quickly.<br/><br/>The thing is that right from the start you have to help players relax about confrontations. The game asks that everyone should have the same goal but almost irreconciliable ways to reach it and players afraid that this will lead to a real-world confrontation will end up ruining the fun of Kingdom. If you crush that fear and point that the fun is exactly trough that point and that all they have to do is trust the mechanics, people will hopefully relax and after the first session they will be eager to try more confrontational approaches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431538/#Comment_431538" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-24T07:44:18+00:00" title="April 24, 2014  7:44AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kingdom asks that you create a potentially-charged situation. That's what the point of the Crossroads is. It talks substantially about creating Crossroads that people are invested in. If players don't follow those directions, it's as if a group of Fiasco players framed and resolved scenes that had nothing to do with their characters' relationships and motivations. It falls flat. You could play Fiasco and choose non-confrontational scenes where success/failure doesn't really do anything. Then the aftermath comes outta nowhere and everyone's confused.<br/><br/>Kingdom gives you a lot of tools: Crossroads, Consequences, and character relationships. If you buy into the premise of "we're going to make high drama", it works.

This non-trivial step of setting up the game is where we formalize that there are different "sides" within a same kingdom: diverging world-views, conflicting goals, or at the very least conflicting and incompatible means of arriving at similar goals. It is almost warranted that player-characters will express their diverging world-views during the game by pushing and twisting each Crossroad a number of ways.<br/>This ties directly into the Roles, of which there are three, all necessary to a healthy kingdom: while each Role can function on its own for a (very) short while, the cooperation of all three is strictly necessary for Crossroad resolution, lest Crisis ensues. The longer can player-characters reach an agreement for easy and bloodless resolution of Crossroads, the longer their kingdom will survive. But, in the long run, is having it just survive good enough for you? Don't you want to try and reshape it into the kingdom you wish for? What if it's turning into exactly the sort of kingdom you fear it might become?<br/>I also believe that the players' actual political views may affect their play, in that you may use a character's Role ability (make a dire prediction, say) in order to make a point about how things work in real life. I know it's tempting to do so, and what can go wrong if you embrace temptation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431591/#Comment_431591" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-25T09:07:12+00:00" title="April 25, 2014  9:07AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly, the game works it's best when player's characters disagree about something and can keep going as long as the characters remain faithful to their principles, despite having to make negotiations and/or concessions to resolve a crossroad. However, this can only be made if players embrace their characters and roleplay or if players themselves actually have different political/ethical viewpoints and actually want to make a point about standing for it. Both produce an incredibly interesting and fun game, and not real arguments since all players can see the source of their argument, and can only use the mechanics to resolve it.<br/><br/>So, the things that affect the game negatively are only the things that may make it stall: players afraid to involve into an argument consciously or worse, unconsciously; negotiating to the point of changing your character's principles, stop doubting other character's agenda, viewpoints or means. And above all this, failing to realize that no matter how logic the situation, course of action and possible repercutions sound, there's no realistic way the characters on the roles or power, perspective or touchstone may agree on every single thing. The moment they do, Crossroads stop being an issue and the game ends prematurely.<br/><br/>It actually happened on one of our games while playtesting, our kingdom was Star Wars universe when Sith ruled the galaxy. I can remember only two of the threats now: ewok population growing too quickly among the empire citizens and a jedi rebellion. We ended up sending ewoks to concentration camps on three different planets to breake them, brainwash the strongest and turning the best of them into an elite of cheap killing machines to deal with the jedi, wiping both issues at once. I think the third threat was economical downfall, which we avoided making a good deal out of military companies providing the cheap armor and weaponry for the ewoks. Everything was made too easy since the three roles hated both ewoks and the jedi, and being poor. Also, something leads me to think that unconciously we were trying to avoid a confrontation betwen ourselves, so nobody stood for what seemed like the losing sides of these crossroads. The game was still fun, but I still feel it ended too soon and we didn't get to use many of the other interesting game mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431677/#Comment_431677" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T20:32:39+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  8:32PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2014 9:42PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, everyone. I feel like I have a better handle on this now. Here are the ideas I've taken from this thread (and from re-reading the rules):<br/><br/><br/><i><b>Before the game starts</b></i><br/><br/>When pitching the game, emphasise that part of the fun comes from setting up dilemmas for your friends, and enjoying when you're forced to make difficult decisions.<br/><br/><br/><i><b>While creating the Kingdom and characters</b></i><br/><br/>I suspect Kingdom will benefit from having two Perspectives who have differing takes on what will happen. As facilitator, be prepared to take on the second Perspective role myself in order to model good Crossroads dilemmas.<br/><br/>Ensure that all the characters care about the Kingdom and will be affected by what happens to it. "If you think another player has made a character who is not solidly part of the Kingdom, point it out to them."<br/><br/>Wishes and Fears are vital: they formalize that there are different "sides" within a same kingdom: diverging world-views, conflicting goals, or at the very least conflicting and incompatible means of arriving at similar goals. Your choice tells the other players what issues you want to see the Kingdom confront--pick a Wish or Fear you want to explore in play. (Having two Perspectives with different Wishes and / or Fears seems like it'd be a great way of creating the types of Crossroads I think would make the game thrive.)<br/><br/><br/><i><b>Starting the game</b></i><br/><br/>The very first action you take is to create a Crossroads.<br/>+ follow the instructions<br/>+ Look at a Wish or Fear and make a Crossroad that puts the Kingdom right on the path that a character wants or dreads<br/>+ Ask yourself: Does this Crossroad interest you? Do you care about how it will turn out? <br/>+ Check with the other players: does it interest or excite any of them? "Interest" is about the consequences and possibilities that the Crossroad raises. We must be genuinely in doubt about what the Kingdom will decide (so a Crossroad that seems like the next natural step or a foregone conclusion is probably an ineffective Crossroad)<br/><br/>Help players relax about confrontations.

Yes, disagreement is baked into the rules but it\u2019s intentionally subtle. At the start, brainstorming Threats puts everyone on the same page about the issues that are going to be central to their game. You aren't required to use the Threats but they tend to influence everyone's view of the Kingdom. Those decisions also influence the Wishes/Fears players pick (even if the players don\u2019t realize it). Wishes/Fears are not allowed to agree, so it gives all the characters different motivations. They may not have direct conflict but they want a lot of different things.\n<blockquote>Look for the following things that might make the game stall: <br/>\u2026<br/>+ players who have their characters negotiate (to the point of changing their character's principles or capitulating to another character's agenda, viewpoints or means)</blockquote>\nIt can actually be _very_ interesting to see characters roll over and abandon their principles, so long as we (as players) recognize that is what\u2019s happening and that it is important. That\u2019s good stuff.<br/><br/>It\u2019s only bad when players underestimate its importance or just do it out of timidity or laziness. That\u2019s when other players (in any game) should say \u201chey, wait a minute, this is a big deal! Did your character just totally change positions?\u201d That\u2019s also why everyone reviews and adjusts their Wish/Fear at the end of the Crossroad, so they have a moment to reflect and tell us what\u2019s going on in their character\u2019s heart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432237/#Comment_432237" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T13:22:56+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  1:22PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2014 6:12PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Ben: that's a great insight--it gives me a better understanding of how character change works in Kingdom.<br/><br/>This thread feels pretty finished, but I have one other question (which isn't really related to its topic): Does the Perspective's predictions have to account for what the Touchstone has said is true?

Perspective can predict what will happen, but can\u2019t predict what the people think about it (that's up to Touchstone), just like they can't predict what Power will do.<br/><br/>You can get some interesting cases where each Role is controlling a different facet of what is happening. Perspective predicts riots. When they happen Touchstone gets to decide if the people are for the riots (it could just be some fringe groups) and/or why they are rioting, and then Power gets to decide what to do about the riots. And then Touchstone reacts to that, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432311/#Comment_432311" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T19:25:12+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  7:25PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's super-nifty how the balance of power works.
