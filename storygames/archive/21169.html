She's good-aligned but has a strong propensity toward violence, and her drive is to free other slaves. Last session, the party encountered a Splugorth (gross tentacle slavers) with his own cadre of Altara slaves. When the PC Altara Crazy witnessed this, the GM called for her to roll to see if she could avoid charging in recklessly to murder the Splugorth.<br/><br/>This was considered fair and acceptable by all members of the group, and it got me to thinking that players ought to lose agency of their characters when the characters encounter emotional distress. This ought not be too common of an occurrence, but there are times when realistic portrayal of characters involves them falling victim to their foibles (and rising above them).<br/><br/>To this end, I seek mechanics that provide for a loss of agency with appropriate pacing. With a loss of agency, there is a fine balance in frequency and the "gameability" of mechanics. An overuse of the mechanics becomes dull and can become unfun for the players losing agency, while an underuse turns them into an afterthought reliant entirely on the GM's tracking.<br/><br/>I know that Fate deals with this with compels. Burning Wheel has something similar with emotional attributes. Numenera does a watered-down version of this with GM intrusions, though these are more external. Are there any other systems that do this reasonably well?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463933/#Comment_463933" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T21:44:10+00:00" title="June 13, 2017  9:44PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The act under pressure/fire move from <i>Apocalypse world</i> and its hacks.

It's generally easy to hack this feature into many games.<br/><br/>I applaud this inclination myself; I've long felt that the most genuine drama requires players to accept the idea that the player is more of a superego for their character than a puppetmaster. The player should not have supernatural control over the character's instincts, and this implies that sometimes the character does stuff against their own best interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463935/#Comment_463935" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T22:49:27+00:00" title="June 13, 2017 10:49PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2017 10:57PM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, the usual caveat lector that I'm fine with different games being designed in different ways re this, and that I'm always happy to see deliberate design being thoroughly tested.<br/><br/>So what I'm going to write applies to only my <i>preference</i> in this regard when it comes to adventure games, not my proposal for universal law.<br/><br/>It is my strong and strict preference to let the player make these sort of decisions. It's something that's a very imporant part of why I play these games.<br/><br/>An emotional reaction, and I'm going to state this strictly enough to include emotional situations <b>both with and without an accompanied <i>action</i></b> such as this, is (and for the third time, I'll clarify that I'm speaking only of my preference for my bread&amp;butter gaming) is 100% the domain of the player. It can and has been argued that typical humans aren't in complete control of their own emotions, and that the same should apply to the character. I can sidestep that debate by stating the simple fact that <i>were</i> that argument true, that'd still leave this domain under the control of either the character's player, another participant at the table (such as a GM, scene caller, resolver, keeper, or fellow player), the games' mechanics, or a mix.<br/><br/>Out of those four option, then, I select to place this completely under my control as that character's player.<br/><br/>To be completely specific, I'd like to refer to <a href="http://dbtselfhelp.com/html/er_handout_3.html" rel="nofollow">Marsha Linehan's model for describing emotions</a>.<br/><br/>"Prompting event 1" I cede to the participants (myself and others \u2014 including DM) and mechanics at the table. The second edition of this model, which I haven't found online, adds physical circumstances such as exhaustion and thirst. These I cede to the games' mechanic. <em>As an input only,</em> not as a deciding factor.<br/><br/>The rest of the elements in the model is completely within the character's player's domain. So far, I've been specific about emotional components.<br/><br/>Now, let me be specific about game mechanics related to this.<br/><br/>First of all, any player-initiated tools for handling this domain ("I'll just roll for what my character does") are affirmatively welcome and appreciated.<br/><br/>Second of all, any <i>suggestion</i>-based tools ("You'll get a fate point if you get angry, run in and attack the slavers") are also appreciated <b>on the uncompromisable condition</b> that they're part of metanarrative "dramatic" tools and not viewed as an accurate simulation of the character's inner life, thoughts, emotions, reactions or actions. ("It would be interesting if you, a character with a history of getting angry, got angry now" over "You, a character with a history of getting angry, gets angry now"). Again, for the fourth time, this uncompromising attitude is about my preference for my bread&amp;butter "adventure gaming". I can still enjoy a session of Fiasco.<br/><br/>Third of all, any supernatural de-agentialization ("Dominate" discipline in Vampire: the Masquerade, mind-control spells or lycanthropy in fantasy settings) are not considered in violation of this rule. For a while now, I've started questioning S-G's (former?) stance against these, a stance I originally shared but no longer do. But that's a topic for another thread.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, to answer the general point over participant agency, now that I've made my view in the specific case of "agency over character's emotions" clear. Some games are more interesting with some restrictions, yes. I agree with that.<br/><br/><br/>I guess I should also add a "why" to my hard stance: Because working on this part of the character, and making myself aware of my own emotional reactions to the described elements and events in the shared imagined space, <i>is why I play</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463936/#Comment_463936" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T22:56:28+00:00" title="June 13, 2017 10:56PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2017 11:09PM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The player should not have supernatural control over the character's instincts</p></div></blockquote>\nTo what extent a person can learn to have  control over their own instincts, and whether or not that is supernatural, is something I feel strongly about. However, that is only tangentially related to the question of whether a <i>player</i> should have control over the <i>character's</i> instincts, which would definitely not be supernatural, no more than the player having a choice of the character's actions, taste in clothes, or birth name, and no more than the GM having (partial, in a gloracle-driven game) control over the NPCs and the locations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463938/#Comment_463938" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T23:07:10+00:00" title="June 13, 2017 11:07PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a problem with your preferences in this regard. This is an area of creative psychology where roleplaying as a medium has such wide possibilities that it's no wonder at all if people have different inclinations. It's not even like my preferences on this are absolute and fanatical - I merely prefer certain types of drama-oriented story games (narrativistic ones, if I am allowed to specify) to construe themselves in a certain way, and that includes characters struggling with the ambiguity of their emotions in a very explicit, game-mechanical ways. There are other types of games where I prefer players to have an immersive character relationship, with no modeling of character psychology in the rules at all because it's all up to the subjective whims of the player.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if I offended by characterizing puppet-like control as "supernatural", that was not my intent - I was merely highlighting how in the real world we <i>don't</i> have a detached, simplified relationship with our own feelings, and how this difference places us in a somewhat unrealistic situation when playing characters in games. It's a situation that some games choose to address with rules that modulate the player/character relationship in various ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463939/#Comment_463939" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T23:08:14+00:00" title="June 13, 2017 11:08PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For example: Something comes up in the SIS that scares me.

I've seen people do this intentionally, too: "Man, I don't know what my character does so I think I'll roll Wisdom checks anytime he might decide to do something stupid."<br/><br/>However, the original poster asked for examples of games which do this well, not our personal opinions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'll add a kink to the discussion:<br/><br/>I think that game mechanics and fictional circumstances often conspire to influence character and player behaviour. It doesn't have to be overt, like how D&amp;D's XPs will often make characters far more bloodthirsty (or less likely to respect ownership of, ahem, valuable items). It can be more subtle, too.<br/><br/>I recently put together a hack of Monsterhearts where there was this mysterious, alien THING you could interact with, and an fun/interesting mechanical process for doing so. In addition, characters didn't have any special abilities or "moves". The result is that the characters as well as the players all felt powerfully drawn to this THING: everything about the setup of the game, both fictionally and mechanically, made it the focus of play and incentivized everyone to interact with it. That's where the fun was.<br/><br/>In this case, it was exactly what I wanted. But I've seen the opposite - like groups playing D&amp;D and hoping to get intrigue or romance stories, but always getting drawn into combats, instead. Give the players a strong investment in their character's ability to fight, give every opponent or rival hit points, give people a rulebook which is full of cool things you can do while fighting, and then make fighting things the only way you can reliably get a result in the game... is it a big surprise D&amp;D games devolve into combat?<br/><br/>(I'm talking about D&amp;D games where this isn't desired, of course. If you're into fighting monsters, then you've got the right game in front of you, and it's serving your needs, instead. But I've seen so many groups try to do something else entirely and fail... and I have no doubt that this is part of the reason.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463941/#Comment_463941" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T23:14:49+00:00" title="June 13, 2017 11:14PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero. <br/><br/>Paul, hopefully my preference can stand as a start of a catalogue for various techniques in this regard.

They could be fine to bring that to the table themselves if they get a reward for it or it could be perhaps just having a signal that the GM will seize agency for the sake of the story.  <br/><br/>I've played on a game where we agreed with the GM that when he called for "cinematics" (as in video-game unavoidable cinematic parts where the players have no choice)  it meant that we could sit back, relax and enjoy the narration, with the guarantee that after that part we would get our agency back. It's perhaps a bit crude, but it worked since everyone on the table had previous experiences with this on videogames; also, reaching such points felt sort of like a milestone for the same reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463970/#Comment_463970" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T17:35:11+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  5:35PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" rel="nofollow">Simonpaulburley</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>With reference to the OP, the traddest of the Trad games - GURPS and Hero/Champions have always done this.
