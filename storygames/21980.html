If you like your science fiction more traditional, you might like to check out either <b>Into the Void</b> or the latest edition of <b>Era</b>. Another project, that might be of interest, could be <b>vs. KICKSTARTER</b> as it doesn\u2019t offer one but three games, even though they are small ones. I got it flagged to have a look at it later on. interessant finde. If you are into steampunk you might like to take a look at <b>Aether and Steamworks</b>. If you fancy dinos, you the two zine rpgs <b>Escape from Dino Island</b> and <b>Dino Wranglers</b> giving you plently. Well, and among the fantasy rpg zines<b> 5D6 RPG Zine</b> stands out to me, as its an English game from Germany.<br/>Among the dice I like the design of the <b>SkullSplitter</b> ones, if you want to see a tabletop rpg related project going of like a rocket, check the Critical Role projects <b>The Legend of Vox Machina Animated Special</b>. I consider the <b>Draugr &amp; Draculas OSR</b> zine at least interesting.<br/>If you are interested in projects past the English ones, I would like to briefly take the time to suggest that you check out the French <b>VALERIAN</b> crowdfunding project, if you like the comic or movie by the same name. If you like to take a look into the design of adventures as well as scenarios and understand German, you should check out <b>\u201cAbenteuer gestalten\u201d</b>, which I backed.<br/>You\u2019ll find plenty more projects and patreons in the collection, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Science Fiction Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games (Dinos)<br/>3 Magazine Role-Playing Games (Fantasy)<br/>2 Patreon Projects<br/>1 Setting<br/>5 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>3 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>2 Accessoires<br/>3 Magazines (NPC, Monster, Stories)<br/>2 Magazines (D&amp;D)<br/>3 Magazines (OSR)<br/>3 Movie / Twitch Projects<br/>4 Apps &amp; Tools<br/>2 Various RPG Projects<br/>2 Various RPG/Dungeoncrawl Games<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 Campaign<br/>2 Live Action Projects<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/10/crowdfunding-collection-99-part-1-of-2/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/03/10/crowdfunding-collection-99-part-1-of-2/</a><br/><br/>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/10/crowdfunding-collection-99-part-2-of-2/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 99, including every tabletop project started between 02/24 and 03/10.</b></a><br/><br/>In the last two weeks a total of 117 fresh projects have been released, thus I spread them over two crowdfunding collections.<br/>This part focuses more on English projects. For example the RPG in a magazine <b>Dangerous Times: Muckrakers and Magic in Old New York!</b>. The game is set in a literally magical New York in the 20ties and the players assume the role of journalists trying to find a story. I like the setting, the idea and I backed it. Another game I backed is <b>LIFTS</b>, though it has a quite different approach, integrating fitness  into the game. If you like to focus more on training your mind and STEM capabilities, check out <b>STEAM Hack</b>. In regards to Urban \u201eFantasy\u201c or rather games set in contemporary kinds you should take a look at the second edition of <b>Mercenaries Spies &amp; Private Eyes</b> or at <b>Hidden Worlds</b> and <b>Justice Velocity</b>. If you prefer your fantasy to be more classical check out the remastered edition of <b>Basic and Expert RPG Sets Remastered!</b> and secondedition of <b>Wraith Recon</b>, the dark fantasy approach of <b>GODS</b> or the games <b>The World After</b> and <b>NEMESYN</b>.<br/>In regards to the patreons, I felt tempted to back the one by <b>Caias Ward</b> and in general terms I couldn\u2019t resist the magnificent beauty of the <b>Elder Dice</b>. I am currently still trying to make up whether or not to go for the <b>Necrocuadernomic\xf3n</b> notebook, which looks beautiful. Well, or maybe the <b>Fail Faster: The Playtesting Journal</b>, which offers an interesting concept. The <b>Gamer Pride Stickers and Pins</b> are looking cool, the coloring book <b>After the Wipe</b> for Low Life, there are so many cool Zines, especially about world building, cool supplements\u2026.<br/>You\u2019ll find plenty more projects and patreons in the collection, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Urban (Fantasy) Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Magazine Role-Playing Games (Muscles &amp; Brains)<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>2 Patreon Projects<br/>1 Setting<br/>5 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>3 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>3 Coin and Token Projects<br/>5 Magazines<br/>3 Magazines (Worldbuilding)<br/>5 Magazines (System Specific)<br/>3 Enamel Pins<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>4 Notebooks<br/>2 Various RPG Projects<br/>2 Various RPG/Card Games<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Campaign<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/10/crowdfunding-collection-99-part-2-of-2/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/03/10/crowdfunding-collection-99-part-2-of-2/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481204/#Comment_481204" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-17T19:29:18+00:00" title="March 17, 2019  7:29PM">March 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/17/crowdfunding-collection-100/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 100, including every tabletop project started between 03/10 and 03/17.</b></a><br/><br/>This time around I\u2019ll present you with 31 projects, among whom there are many really interesting ones.<br/>Like <b>Dark Streets and Darker Secrets</b>, which according to its own description covers urban horror and modern fantasy genre wise. I\u2019d summarize it as urban fantasy and consider the old school approach quite something new. Considering I followed it before the start, and love urban fantasy I backed it without hesitation. If you like to follow suite, you should be fast, as the project will end on Wednesday.  Another project I liked and back is <b>Mysthea</b> by Jay Iles. I am already enamored with Jays Legacie game line and fancy the geomantic fantasy approach of this Powered by the Apocalypse inspired game.<br/><b>Cut to the Chase</b> has the interesting aspect of offering a 2-player game concept, with the players assuming the roles of predator and prey respectively. I am strongly tempted by the projects and got it starred. If you like a more traditional fantasy game, with still a narrative approach, you should check out <b>MIGHT &amp; MAGIC</b> which appears to be inspired by Might &amp; Mystic. I do consider card based systems cool and would recommend taking a look at <b>BASE: a CaRdPG</b>, which offers a generic, universal system and thus doesn\u2019t come with a setting. Then again, if you are a metal head, you might enjoy checking out <b>METAL WORLD</b>. <b>Gadzook</b> confused me a bit, as its a hybrid between being a role-playing and a skyrmish game, if you like both, it might be worth taking a look at it.<br/>I did back the source book <b>CAPERS Noir</b> for CAPERs in a blink, as I love the base game and gangsters \u2013 especially noir style \u2013 is a fancy of mine. I feel very strongly tempted to back the <b>Welcome to Tikor</b> setting and artbook as I got another weak spot for afropunk and the like, yet I\u2019ll likely wait till the original system for the setting is available. If you like to support the creation of the system, you might like to check out the <b>Swordsfall Patreon</b>.<br/>Next to those you\u2019ll find cool accessoires like the <b>Dungeon Quills</b>, which are basically fancy pens, and the <b>Trailblazer Game</b> stamps, which enable you to stamp out a map. There is an interesting podcast present with <b>Mud &amp; Blood</b> and I do like the design of the dice by <b>Kenzie</b>. Tho they are imho quite expensive and the project presentation isn\u2019t to my requirements. You\u2019ll find more interesting projects like the D&amp;D supplemtents, including one by Monte Cook.<br/>Amon the non-english projects I got charmed by <b>Espa\xf1a Can\xedbal</b>. Were my Spanish better than it is, I would back it. Even with the state of my language skills, I feel tempted to back the very Spanish Post-Apocalyptic setting with a dash of organized crime.<br/>Just take a look at the collection and see if you find something that tickles your fancy:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Role-Playing Game Hybrid<br/>4 Settings<br/>3 Supplement<br/>2 D&amp;D Supplement<br/>1 Adventure<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>1 Accessoire<br/>1 Podcast<br/>1 Magazine<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Dungeon Crawler<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 Comic<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Supplement<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/17/crowdfunding-collection-100/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/03/17/crowdfunding-collection-100/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481299/#Comment_481299" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-25T20:10:28+00:00" title="March 25, 2019  8:10PM">March 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/25/crowdfunding-collection-101/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 101, including every tabletop project started between 03/17 and 03/25.</a><br/><br/>I do like the approach of <b>Pretty Fairy Princess</b> which is a proudly dainty game. You\u2019ll play a thumbsized fairy princess and her compagnions. The projects loos very cute and I recommend having a look at it\u2026 fast. Because it will end at 03/26 1am CET or 5pm PST.<br/>Another project I do recommend wholeheartidly is <b>Critical Core</b>, which is a fantasy rpg that aims to help children on the autistic spectrum. Check it out, and maybe consider adding your support.<br/><b>Ruin Masters</b> on the other hand is a totally classic fantasy role-playing game with cool illustrations and a solid system. If you like to play a game in a more contemporary setting, well <b>Fellowship of the White Star</b> addresses the roaring twenties and adds in the supernatural for good measures, then there is the neon-lit <b>Night Life</b> having you roam around as a wizard in the 80s and last but not least you have the option to leap into the 21st century and enjoy superhero shenannigans with <b>Prowlers &amp; Paragons</b>.<br/>There are many more worthwhile projects. Like <b>Save College of Wizardry!</b> which tries to save the blockbuster Larp event after Dziobak Studios, the original company, went belly up and closed. Then there is <b>Mother of Darkness</b> which aims to translate an impressive looking supplement for Symbaroum and I do say that the dice trays and dice in <b>The Inspiration Collection</b> look quite stylish.<br/>If you\u2019re interested in German tabletop games you might like to take a look at <b>Fallen World</b>. The game features a science fiction setting with some endtime-elements sprinkled in and might be worth having a look.<br/>You find these and more projects here, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Urban (Fantasy) Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Patreon<br/>2 Larps<br/>3 Supplements<br/>2 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>2 Adventures<br/>1 Coin Project<br/>4 Accessoires<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>1 App<br/>2 Various RPG Project<br/>2 Various Game Project<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 Patreon<br/>1 Boardgame<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Campaign<br/>1 Icon &amp; Art<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/25/crowdfunding-collection-101/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/03/25/crowdfunding-collection-101/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481477/#Comment_481477" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-31T16:50:29+00:00" title="March 31, 2019  4:50PM">March 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/31/crowdfunding-collection-102/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 102, including every tabletop project started between 03/25 and 03/31.</b></a><br/><br/>To delve into the last collection being spread via Google+, I would recommend the 2. edition of the Powered by the Apocalypse <b>The Fellowship</b>. I did already back the first edition and am very happy about the book I got and the light-hearted setting. I am as well enticed by <b>Ballad of the Pistolero</b>, the game which has its system roots in a d100 warhammer-like system, offers \u201eaction western\u201c. Which is basically Western like you\u2019ll find it in Red Dead Redemption. I do like the artworks and am tempted to actually back it. Then there is <b>Castles &amp; Cats</b>, which tries to create a cool game for preschoolers and elementary aged kids utilizing cards. It may deserve consideration if you got kids of said age range. The last full rpg project is the 2. edition of <b>Infinite Power</b>, a d8 based superhero system, which only has a total runtime of 8 days. If you like superhero you should check it out fast.<br/>With <b>Wiseguys</b> I backed a setting in a split setting, despite not being a big fan of Savage Worlds. On the one hand because the book explores organized crime through various genre lenses, which is something I collect. On the other hand, because it looks really cool and well made. The pricing is nice, and it\u2019s the first kickstarter I backed for a portrait level. Another cool project is <b>Contagion Chronicles</b> by Onyx Path. It\u2019s a setting to campaign supplement for the Chronicles of Darkness which aims to enable the players to create cool crossover chronicles. I would recommend it to.<br/>With <b>Eidbrecher \u2013 Die J\xe4ger</b> you\u2019ll find a D&amp;D 5E and Pathfinder RPG adventure from Germany. It looks cool, and if you\u2019re interested in German games, I would suggest you check it out.<br/>There are many more cool projects, which you can find here:<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Adventure<br/><b><br/>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Settings<br/>3 Supplement<br/>3 Adventures<br/>2 Dice Projects<br/>1 Accessoire<br/>3 Enamel Pins<br/>1 Playing Cards<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/03/31/crowdfunding-collection-102/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/03/31/crowdfunding-collection-102/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
