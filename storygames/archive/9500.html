Anyways, the first thing that popped into my head was a knife. I don't know what you would do with it, but I think a big old knife stabbed into the middle of the table might do a lot to unnerve the players. Although if its at a con, balance the potential benefits against the chance of crazy con-goers and sharp things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210709/#Comment_210709" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-06T09:38:29+00:00" title="June  6, 2009  9:38AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>I tend to make people with only 1 cold write down I kill puppies for stan</blockquote>\nHilarious!<br/><br/>Here's a thing I do: you know how the NPCs have little character statements at the end of their stuff? I make the players write a quick sentence on their stuff too.
