It took the internet to reveal to me that gaming is rotten with liberals.  (insert VERY friendly smile)<br/><br/>So, the concept of political correctness in games is something realatively new to me.  Forty years of killing people and taking their stuff kind of defines the hobby as an equal opportunity cut throat.  As a card carrying libertarian, I want the PC police to keep their hands off of my players and their games.  There are thousands of games and game settings out there.  It's truly a cornucopia of variety and freedom of expression.   Vote with your dollars if you don't like one, but don't consider it your duty to infringe on the people's free speech and personal definition of fun.  A classic example would be blaxploitation.  Is it PC?   Oh hellz no, but it can make for a very fun game.  Is anyone hurt?  No.  Some people might bring baggage to the table, but the game itself is not doing a thing to anyone.

I am excited about that game, more so  after reading the sample page.<br/><br/>I'm a little worried about the generic resolution system, but, whatever, it's a buck.\n<blockquote> So, does that (or any) game make someone racist? </blockquote>\nNo, I don't think so. Racism is about systemic disadvantages, not hurt feelings. Racism is hiring a white dude over a more qualified person of color. Racism is red-lining. Racism is the prison system and black infant mortality rates and the 41 bullets fired at Amadou Diallo and all the other stuff mentioned near the beginning of the podcast.<br/><br/>The closest thing I could imagine to this kind of racism within the RPG community would be refusing to buy a game designed by a person of color or creating a whites only professional organization for designers. There would have to be material harm perpetuated through organization in order for it to be racist.<br/><br/>Playing a game like Funkadelic Frankenstein might be insensitive, but it's not racist. And, frankly, playing it hurts no one.\n<blockquote><br/> Does it result in racist actions against actual people?  Or, is it just another fantasy game? *<br/></blockquote>\nIt's not just another fantasy game. It's an attempt at social satire, I think.
