Sheesh!</blockquote>\nWhich I think is a bit unfair. Having read the obit myself I felt it said that TTRPG's (specifically D&amp;D) exploded as a fad in the 1980's, made a few million dollars and continue to enjoy a small following to this day, and also directly spawned the computer gaming industry which measures its profits in the billions. Which all sounds reasonable to me. Interpreting that as a malicious attack on the hobby is silly, even a little juvenile.<br/><br/>Lets be clear on the facts. From a mainstream perspective, TTRPG'ing (and Story Games, if you prefer) is insignificant by any reasonable criteria. Financially, more money is probably moved by even the hubcap industry alone. Culturally, even rodeos probably have a bigger impact. Compared to the phenomenal growth and presence of computer gaming, it barely even registers.<br/><br/>So when mainstream papers take the perspective that Gygax's (and tabletop gaming's) ongoing legacy is most relevant in how it lead to MMORPG's, its completely valid. Its just disconcerting that pulling back to a wide view shows what we often envision as the great citadel of gaming is just another bump on the cultural plain, and not a very big one at that. Worse, seeing it eclipsed by the shadow of the flashy tower with the "World of Warcraft" sign, makes some folks bristle.<br/><br/>None of which invalidates my (or anyone else's) enjoyment of the hobby, or efforts within it to grow it commercially or creatively. Being small is not the same thing as being nonexistent, nor does something need to be big or loud to be worthwhile. But I think pulling back to the long view every so often is important, and keeps me from taking some of the more picayune gaming controversies seriously.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Of course, countering entirely everything said above, note that Gygax rated full obit's in both the The Times of London and The New York Times, ongoing media attention, and a surprising turn of sympathy and recognition from many levels of society. It may not be all that small in here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133120/#Comment_133120" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T23:07:02+00:00" title="March  6, 2008 11:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It used to be a lot bigger, but that was a fad.

In painting such a sterotypical picture of what it means to be a gamer they were doing the same by implication to Gary.<br/><br/>Their history of D&amp;D too, missed the more recent releases of 3rd edition, instead portraying the game as having faded away into near obscurity after AD&amp;D. Is this really fair? Of course our hobby is not widespread, but is it really smaller than it used to be? That is not the impression that I get. <br/><br/>I'd like to see the media give serious value to roleplaying as an activity, whatever the medium. Tabletop, Computer, Forum and what have you. And to fantasy gaming, as expressed in RPGs, CCGs, and even modern fantasy movies. To me it is clear that our whole culture has changed its attitude to fantasy and fiction, it pervades everything now. Look at any blockbuster movie lineup, children's bookstore, or computer games shop, as an example. TTRPGs were not responsible for that, but they are part of an associated phenomenon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133131/#Comment_133131" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T01:09:12+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  1:09AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>nor does something need to be big or loud to be worthwhile.</blockquote>\nQFT.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I'd like to see the media give serious value to roleplaying as an activity, whatever the medium.</blockquote>\nUnlikely, until we reassess our point of view on aging and imaginative play.

A couple of years ago it would have pissed me off, but now I think it's just how anything fringe gets treated - rather than researching independantly, it's far easier for news organizations to fall back on tired stereotypes.

Is that a net positive?<br/>* Increased market pressures to serve the needs of the broadened demographic. Is that a net positive? Has D&amp;D's development benefitted from having to serve such a broad market?<br/>* General calcification of what the activity "should" be as a result of media groupthink.<br/>* Involvement by commercial interests who do not have gamers' interests at heart.<br/><br/><i>"You call someplace paradise, kiss it goodbye."</i><br/>-- <i>The Last Resort</i>, The Eagles<br/><br/>I don't advocate <i>less</i> coverage, either.

It is obvious that either (a) no one at NYT has ever played D&amp;D or (b) the managing editor didn't give a shit about the subject and tossed it to some obit hack. (Note that obit writing is, typically, entry-level or even apprentice-level work, at most papers.)<br/><br/>It bothers me more that fellow gamers say, "meh" and so many of my peers say, "who?" :{                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133358/#Comment_133358" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:43:21+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:43PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as coverage goes, I would imagine there would be many journalists happy to pick up such a job because they "played D&amp;D once" (maybe were even fanatics in their youth), but now, grown up, with their cool jobs and cool friends, are too afraid of how they'll be perceived.
