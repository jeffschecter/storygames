                    The idea is that the characters work together to solve a mystery of some sort. It could be a CSI game, a police detective game, a thriller murder mystery game, a Star Trek "solve the riddle" episode game, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
None of the players has any clue what the actual solution to the mystery is. There is no GM. The mystery is "discovered" through invention and play until resolved satisfactorily.<br/>
<br/>
The rules allow one player per scene to investigate some lead. There's freeform role-playing, then the player rolls dice and determines if he gets a clue or a red herring or a complication or a dead-end. The player invents the appropriate fiction to support the roll, then plays it out with the rest of the group. <br/>
<br/>
I imagine that there's a difficulty number set for the solution of the mystery. Let's say we set it at 10 for one game. As play progresses, the Progress Meter is incremented by successfully finding clues. It starts at 0 and each clue the players find moves it up a notch. The difficulty of finding a clue is based on the Progress Meter, so it becomes harder and harder as the game gets to the end (though collection of certain types of player currency will help the players a lot).<br/>
<br/>
Red herrings could spawn a separate mystery that must be "solved" before the real mystery can be solved. Start it at some relatively low difficulty rating, say 3. Maybe it applies only to the character who "found" it.<br/>
<br/>
Complications either push up the difficulty or decrement the Progress Meter. Dead ends just take up time (and a scene) with no other numerical effects.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that the players build a relationship map during play, and it is revised constantly as new information is "discovered" (invented). I would also allow for a player to introduce a fact that made it totally difficult to tie things together storywise, and make the resolution of the r-map and story a pre-requisite to the end game.<br/>
<br/>
Characters might have some basic attributes in common (e.g., Street, Brains, Muscle, Tech, Instinct) plus lots of freeform traits representing character abilities and issues and relationships. Probably develop some in chargen, and the majority during play. Once you use a trait, you cross it off your sheet. You'll need to earn rewards to get new ones (maybe even the same ones you had before).<br/>
<br/>
The roll in a scene would be a conflict with the stakes: "Do you learn the next clue?" All the character issue stuff comes into the scene as necessary color (because you're narrating for the issue traits you bring in for a better roll).<br/>
<br/>
I'd use a pile-of-d6 resolution system. Pick the attribute that most applies to this scene. Roll that many d6es. Count up the number of 6's. If that is greater than the Progress Meter (PM), then you find a clue. If it's equal to the PM, it's a dead end. If it's less than the PM, you get a red herring or complication (not sure how to determine which). Cross off a trait and narrate appropriately to get a reroll of all the non-6 dice. Do this (burn a trait and reroll) as many times as you want, or just stop at any time.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that doing certain things in the game might net you Story Points, which you can spend on new traits or spend on extra dice during a roll. Reward players for bringing another (willing) character into the scene, and for intentionally losing a roll.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone want to run with this?                </div>

                            :) This is almost exactly like an idea I've been working with lately. I think this is the only way to do a murder mystery game, with the outcome being reached by the players introducing clues as they go.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking something a bit more competitive, though, where each of the investigators has a reputation score that will go up or down depending on how many of the clues the player introduces are accepted in the final solution to the crime. Then, other players could turn some clues or lines of inquiry into red herrings.                        </div>

                            My feeling was that the group starts out by determining something that happened, yes. Or roll on some tables. Or draw some cards.<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on the genre. In a CSI game, it's probably as simple as "This guy was found dead." Then play starts. Clue scenes revolve around questions about the mystery: Who is he? How was he killed? Who has a motive to kill him? Where were the suspects at the time of death? What was the REAL cause of death? etc.                        </div>

                            Interesting.<br/><br/>Actually, I'm working on something for the Ghost Killers: The GM DOES make a mystery, complete with static clues, behaviors, "facts", etc. There's an "Investigator" class, who has an ability called "Cut the Bullshit", where he gets to ask the GM a straight up Yes or No question and the GM has to respond.<br/><br/>Also, at the beginning, the GM takes six blank note cards, and writes "permanent, immutable facts" on each, stuff like:<br/><br/>The Demons Eats the Eyes of Virgins<br/>The Demon lives in the sewers<br/>The Demon is invisible<br/>Jonathan summoned the Demon<br/>Jonathan wants revenge against his mother<br/>The demon posesses people<br/><br/>Stuff like that. Basically, the players can "uncover" (that is "make up") clues through rolls. The GM has to roll with it.  However, when one of those Immutable Facts is hit, the GM flips over the card and corrects that information, keeping a foundation to the mystery (or, the GM can just "change" the elements of the mystery, if he thinks the players' ideas are cooler).<br/><br/>Ex: <br/>Player: I roll to see if I find any clues in this house. I succeed.<br/>GM: OK, go for it.<br/>Player: Um... OK, I find some claw marks, it's obvious that this demon is eight feet high with huge claws.<br/>GM (flips over card): Actually, it's a posessor demon.<br/>Player: Ah, ok, cool. Well, after NOT finding any physical marks in the room, I'm starting to think that this demon is incorporeal and posesses people...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Adam, you mention that as the investigation draws on "finding" new clues becomes more and more difficult. This strikes me as a pacing problem - things should start out slow and sedate, a fact here a fact there, and generally escalate (for me reading "speed up") as we near the climax.<br/>

                            I can come up with answers to your questions but I really posted this in the spirit of a "Little Idea." That is, it was a bit of half-considered game that I wanted out of my head. I don't really have answers to any of these problems. I am not really looking for people to help ME finish it, but discussion of it is very welcome. If anyone wants to take it and write it into a game, go for it. I don't have time for it.<br/>
<br/>
I find it a very interesting problem because the conflict resolution system feels remarkably different than that of other games.<br/>
<br/>
As for "red herring = wasted time," I didn't mean to imply that's what I was thinking unless you equate "wasted time" with not moving towards the solution of the mystery. I imagined that it would put some additional steps between the player and the end game, but other players could still trigger the end game. The trick is to make the red herring inconvenient but not too annoying. I see the scenes inserted by the red herring as chances for additional character development. <br/>
<br/>
Certainly social commentary comes in any time a player narrates in a clue or red herring that has something to say about society. Characterization comes in any time a player address his character's issues on his sheet. I'd treat issues like any other trait: narrate in an issue, cross it off, get a reroll.                        </div>

                            I can totally sympathise with the "get it out of my head" thing, Adam.  I didn't do that with Web of Shadows and it's now pestering me something fierce.<br/>
<br/>
What I was getting at, however, is this -- what if a "red herring" meant that the ensuing scene (or preceding scene) doesn't forward the mystery, but it does -- mechanically -- forward characterization or social commentary?                        </div>
