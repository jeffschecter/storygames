Where no electricity is, there is no computer and console-games. Where no functional factories are maintained, there is no paper and printing. Simple role-playing games rule the world of entertainment. People scratch themselves their characters in the dirt, squatting with bone-dice in their hands, narrating grand <i>contemporary</i> (for their time) dystopias and quite believable and realistic sounding armageddons. <br/><br/>And their game-smiths make epic games on the folly of generations before them, mocking the age of enlightenment and industrialization, laughing their heads of, and crying a bit, over "the post-modern era", which they have aptly renamed <i>the last modern era</i>. Doing silly comedies set to that era, with characters of grand ineptness trying to save the earth, while refusing to change anything that leads to the catastrophe.<br/><br/>Role-playing games will be an effective tool for building tradition, propagate learning and developing sustainable philosophies. They will teach us love, happiness and good use of the environment, laying the foundations of an extraordinary surge in spiritual development amongst mankind. Mankind will gradually find itself in a paradise of real and imagined low-tech co-existence. All will be well, for the earth will regain its balance seven million years after the environmental catastrophe, with humans still roaming the continents, and having fun with their handprinted and highly sophisticated role-playing games.<br/><br/>Huzzah!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311971/#Comment_311971" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T23:00:32+00:00" title="February  9, 2011 11:00PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (hmmm. i'd forgotten that the world was ending still. damn it.)<br/><br/>I don't know if you're kidding, but if you are, then i can be serious about this for you.<br/>Or at least i can pretend to be serious, which, as we all know, is pretty much the same thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311972/#Comment_311972" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T23:45:30+00:00" title="February  9, 2011 11:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>And I gave this Grand Prediction:</blockquote>\nThat is really bleak and depressing.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/><br/>Grand prediction:  Within twenty years, RPGs will no longer be sold as physical books anywhere.

That's a grand prediction indeed.<br/><br/>Accounting for Taste: what you say is quite possible considering the printing costs and limited printing numbers. However, I sincerely hope not. No electronic means of creating a book can ever be as cool as, say, the ashcan of Acts of Evil. And how about the paper with which In A Wicked Age is printed?<br/>Lots of people recently speak about the disappearance of books in general, but that's not gonna happen. If your ebook reader breaks, you risk losing everything you had in it. A book can fall from a skyscraper and still be perfectly readable. Also, it's a physical medium that needs no support to be used. On the other hand, you can't read a PDF (or other file) without at least a screen.<br/>That leads to the growing frailty of the conservation of communications, and the dependancy from delicate technology for something which hasn't been requiring it for thousands of years, since writing was invented. So I hope your vision won't become true.

(As all the bookshelves in my home will attest to!)<br/><br/>But I have to admit that as enthusiastic as I am about books, I'm less enthusiastic about <i>gaming books</i>: they're expensive and I don't read them nearly as often as I do "real" books, so I could see myself adjusting to digital-only versions of them fairly easily...assuming that the technology and format of them improved a lot over the next ten years or so.  I mean, I only want the gaming books so I can play the games -- I don't need them to look good on the coffee table or the bookshelf or to last a thousand years, I just need them to be usable when we sit down to play at someone's home on Saturday night.  If they can go purely digital and still meet that minimum requirement, I'll be satisfied, because it's <i>playing the game</i> that's the awesome part for me, not <i>having the book</i>.<br/><br/>(and honestly, I would have said something to the effect of there still being <i>some</i> physical gaming books for sale, just not as many as there are now, but I figured the "grand" part of grand prediction meant "unrealistic and exaggerated."  Probably the books that will get sold will be specialty items, sold at a premium by the creator, for people who really want a cool-looking physical book to satisfy their collector's urges.  The mass-market standard will likely shift to digital, but paper will always be around.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311988/#Comment_311988" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T02:49:50+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  2:49AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, there you got some solid points, and no, wasn't commenting your tastes, just your vision.<br/>Now this is starting to sound like a thread where I encouraged people to barf forth their own apocalyptica... neat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311989/#Comment_311989" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T03:04:08+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  3:04AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>(hmmm. i'd forgotten that the world was ending still. damn it.)</blockquote>LOL<br/>It is of utmost importance not to forget the world is ending!

Companies like GW who produce both the minis and the rules as viable for-sale products are extremely rare and almost worthy of consideration as unique situations.<br/><br/>I don't think smaller producers will ever go entirely over to digital, although having both physical and digital available certainly makes sense.
