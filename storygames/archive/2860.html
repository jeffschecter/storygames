The bottom line is that I just didn't care for it.  I saw too much stick when carrot would have been more entertaining and a mound of paperwork that I had zero interest in paying attention to.  And after three sessions, I really didn't care what became of my character, much less anyone else's PCs.</p>\n<p>But what really stuck with me was the positioning system.  At first glance they seemed totally awesome.  At first the rules were a little bit bumpy.  Changing our initiative order between the positioning rounds and attack rounds was terribly bumpy at first, but became smooth from experience during the third session.  Trouble was that after a combat, I didn't have even a little bit of the combat's fiction in my head.  It was pure strategy and zero imaginary space for me.  And I blame the 8-bar positioning system.</p>\n<p>Lemmie take a moment to compare Agon's system to the two extremes that it sits between; D&amp;D's 2D battle map and tMW's near complete lack of combat structure.  In tMW the system encourages me to narrate what my character is up to and how each individual roll turns out.  There's a huge amount of room for me to narrate my character leaping from tree branches, climbing across falling snowflakes, and diving behind fallen corpses for cover.  On the other end of the spectrum is the drawn-out map, where I don't really have much room to author in new elements to the scenery, but I at least have some terrain to use and abuse.  The conflict comes alive in a different way.  But it still comes to life.</p>\n<p>Agon seems to have found that special middle ground where I find myself without any pre-planned background and with neither permission nor incentive to create any of that background.  Thus, the combats failed to spark my fun-meter.</p>\n<p>What do you think of the system?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64958/#Comment_64958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T09:12:44+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  9:12AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would blame the GM for failing to engage you with a vivid mental picture with lots of stuff to use for non-combat, and special-combat,  maneuvers. That's definitely the intent of the rules, and seems to address your main complaint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64984/#Comment_64984" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T10:07:24+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 10:07AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll let others talk about the game itself, but I wanted to say thanks for the critique, Eric.

The character generation of the game was the highlight for me as it totally set the tone for the game.  The early conflicts and tests between characters were great once we got up to speed.  And watching our ability dice rise and fall through our own actions was a bit of brilliant design.  The token system will take some getting used to, especially for "helping" others.  But there is great potential there in my opinion.<br/><br/>But definitely the game fell flat for me when the positioning board came out.  I had kitted myself out to be a master archer, and found it terribly frustrating to have the other players literally pull the opponent closer to get within their sword range.  The positioning board is reminiscent of sumo wrestling to me.  But when you add 5-8 people/monsters to it, the board becomes rather unwieldy and I agree with Eric that it hits a weird middle ground with it's combat system.  I found myself wanting to go back to the "ability vs. ability" tests from the earlier part of the session.<br/><br/>I liked the concept of having different dice in the left and right hands.  This reminded me of a cooler version of what BWR (and other games) do with splitting offensive and defensive dice in combat.  But it seemed to be geared more towards the "shield and sword" fighter and was less useful for a ranged weapon character.<br/><br/>Thanks for being open about constructive criticism, John.  There are a LOT of things I love about the game, so don't take the positioning board feedback for more than it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65046/#Comment_65046" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T13:02:10+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  1:02PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2007 1:03PM by Eric Provost.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>John,</p>\n<p>Awesome.  Glad you're not feeling ganged-up on over all the Agon feedback recently.  For the record, I only pick on it because that's what we <em>JUST</em> got finished playing.  It was totally fresh in my mind.  As far as a <em>"trend of honest feedback"</em>, I can tell you that you'll be seeing more from me.  I see plenty of issues in all of my favourite indie games, and I've been bursting at the seams to discuss them.</p>\n<p>Remi,</p>\n<p>It's true.  You did not bring the 100% Grade-A Awesome to those combats.  None of us did.  But we, the players, were all quite capable of bringing that awesome.  Agon just never invited us to do it.</p>\n<p>-Eric</p>\n<p>edited to add:</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and thanks for your perspective, Chris.  It's nice to know that I'm not the only one.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65071/#Comment_65071" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T14:02:02+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  2:02PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Chris! That's great feedback.<br/><br/>Eric: No worries a'tall. Like I said in the other thread, I'm very happy with Agon. It's easier to hear critical feedback when I'm at a place where I'm completely satisfied with the game, and have heard responses all across the spectrum. Now I have context when someone praises <i>or</i> criticizes it. I no longer have that <i>oh my god back to the drawing board!</i> panic that can happen when a design is still being hammered out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
