By 'history', I'm talking about the 28 pages that covers the creation of the universe, the Titanomachies, Atlantis, and all the other cool stuff that the game is loaded with. Cool stuff that the players need to know in order to create muses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that information very dense. It took me three attempts to read it all the way through. So, I'm asking: how would you explain the Nine Worlds setting?<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin that, I'm asking two questions:<br/>\n1) How much do the players need to know in order to create cool muses?<br/>\n2) How do I explain it in a way that's easy to understand? Timelines, summaries, flip-charts?<br/>\n<br/>\n... and to end on some positives:<br/>\n- I found the information on each planet really easy to read. I could see how to share that with the players. It's the historical information I'm concerned about here.<br/>\n- There's at least one awesome idea (and sometimes, three) on each page of the setting information.<br/>\n- What I love about the setting (and what made me realise why the game's system works the way it does) is the cold war between Titans and Eternals.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68672/#Comment_68672" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T07:46:02+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  7:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the history important?

Ptolemy was right: there are only nine worlds, with Earth at the center of the Cosmos, and aetherspace floating between them. Currently, the conflict is in a cold war stalemate, with the titans in possession of only one planet, Earth out of both sides' reach, and friction growing between the Olympians. You play the part of Archons, the expression of and motive force for the demiurge. If you're from Earth, one day something weird happened, and you caused it. Shortly thereafter, Prometheus turned up and explained the reality of the Cosmos to you, that you're a demigod, and told you to get on with make your life mean something.</blockquote>\nNot every player is going to jazz on the setting details (which I, too, love). From the sketched outline, I ask them what kind of character they're interested in playing, and then suggest setting details that would fit their desires. Like <i>"I wanna be a pirate"</i> says Atlantean, or <i>"I'm an undercover agent"</i> is an Archer or Aegis dude under-cover on ... well, where are the other players?<br/><br/>For my money, the setting gives <i>you</i>, the GM, material to work with: threads of story to weave into your opposition to give them a sense of depth in their imaginings. If y'ask me, what the players <i>need</i> to create Muses is one question:\n<blockquote>You're a demigod, so what do you want out of life?</blockquote>I particularly like it when the question is asked by Prometheus.<br/><br/>For a bit more context, how long are you expecting to play? Long-term, a few sessions, or a one-shot. I would approach a one-shot very differently, now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68679/#Comment_68679" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T09:36:11+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  9:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know very little about Nine Worlds, but just a general question: do characters start savvy, or do they discover details of the setting as they go along?

I actually hadn't thought of that - which reflects my personal bias of not wanting to play out origin stories, anymore. I'll ask the players about their preferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlexander, I'm expecting to play for about three sessions (but I'm also interested in your thoughts on a one-shot). Would that increase the amount of info you'd give the players, or would you stick with your Boxed Text, above? I like your spiel, by the way. It's a nice summary.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat strikes me is that it's important to give the players enough options to come up with a character concept that inspires them. So maybe a combination of Alexander's boxed text, an indication that you can start off already illumined, and then Nick's idea of sketching out the planets is enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68703/#Comment_68703" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T12:36:23+00:00" title="May 12, 2007 12:36PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Three sessions is <em>way</em> too few to justify history at all.

Thanks for asking about this. <br/><br/>Ok, you're already getting great suggestions. I agree that if you're going to do only a hanful of sessions, there's no need to convey the whole weight of the setting's backdrop. Instead, pick a couple planets and focus on the situations there. <br/><br/>For example, you could do a thing with Mars and Sol and how those two powers are competing rivalries for, say, acquiring weapons or something. Maybe it's a hot war on Mars that Sol is funding or something. And, then throw in the Titans because they see opportunity. Instant Afghanistan c. 1980s situation. Neat.<br/><br/>Now, figuring out what smaller chunks of the universe to use may need to wait until your players tell you something about what they want. The trick, of course, is that you've got to tell them JUST enough to "get it" and start coming up with some character ideas.<br/><br/>Here's one quick pitch I like to use: <br/><br/>"The true universe is dominated by a Cold War between the Gods and Titans of Greek myth. You're a mortal in the middle of it all, but you have the power to literally decide the fate of the universe. Whose side are you on? Who is important to you? What do you want to do?"<br/><br/>Follow that up with a conversation. When they start to answer those questions, you can chime in with "Ok, so you want to start your own army? Cool. That sounds like you might be on Mars where they fight wars a lot. Does a desert freedom fighter thing sound cool to you? ... "  Or, "Awesome! You want your guy to kill a Titan! Ok, you've got lots of good company. You could be an agent of Zeus on Jupiter -- they fight the Titans a LOT. Want to be on the front lines on Jupiter, maybe as a super agent kind of guy?"  Etc.<br/><br/>One last note about the history of the book. You've nailed it without realizing. The history isn't so much important <i>as a history</i> per se. It's important as a colorful <i>instruction book</i> for 1) what kinds of conflicts this game is about (big ones, ones with gods, ones that involve passionate family and/or romantic love struggles) and 2) to setting up the Cold War. Right on!<br/><br/>I really hope this helps you out. Please let me know if you'd like some more suggestions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68809/#Comment_68809" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-13T14:54:42+00:00" title="May 13, 2007  2:54PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great stuff, Matt.

Thanks, everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gut still says it'd be useful to nail down how a citizen of the Nine Worlds sees the history of the setting. I'm not talking about all the details presented in the book, but rather the simplified story they tell themselves about the sweep of history. The five or six big important points that make the universe make sense to them. "This Titan trapped his children in Hades, and then they broke out and killed everyone," sort of level.<br/>\n<br/>\nA really, really basic synopsis that does what you suggest above - provide colourful instructions for what sort of conflicts this game is about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
