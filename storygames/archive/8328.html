I've been trying to avoid the phrase "Happy Calvinball", since the use of that term elsewhere is almost purely negative.<br/><br/>But the thing is, it fits.<br/><br/>The idea that the rules aren't something you play <i>in</i>, but something you play <i>with</i> - that the group, fully aware, can make statements about the importance, desired detail, and handling methods of a given fictional thing <b>by picking and choosing the rules to apply to suit that.</b>  That's what I'm build rules to support, more and more.<br/><br/>You could say that I'm talking about "Mechanics that are reconstructed by fiat, mid-play".   Or you could talk about "The art and craft of applying the rules" - both of those, to me, read as identical statements.<br/><br/>Thing is, I'm not sure I'm expressing this clearly, even now.<br/><br/>Anyone know what the hell I'm talking about?  Anyone know how to express it <i>clearly</i>?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183927/#Comment_183927" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T10:07:20+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 10:07AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure.

Many players are ready to do this - to throw together "How to handle X" in a fashion that is just as much fun, in a let's-throw-ideas-around way, as some kinds of group character creation.<br/><br/>Howard largely dodges the issue in his main rules text, other than describing <i>the feel</i> of the games as he plays them. I'll try to find links to freeware versions of his games, but honestly, his rules appear to be there mostly as a starting point/training wheels for the GM and a possible security blanket for the players. OTOH, I've read articles he's written for minis wargaming magazines where he basically describes his rules as "an eye towards whatever seems fun and a simple die-roll to do, well, whatever"<br/><br/>IOW, a straight up, old-skool rpg mentality.<br/><br/>With Paddy Griffith's Mugger Games, he makes it pretty clear from the get-go that the ref is there mostly to create applicable mechanics on the fly. From second-hand discussion ( with Howard Whitehouse and Chris Engle, among others, by way of the TMP message boards, the actual method seems to resemble a very simple set of outcomes provided by the players, officalized and possibly modified by the ref, then assigned ranges on a die which is thrown.<br/><br/>So, not <i>completely</i> dissimilar to stake-setting. Other mechanics are created ad-hoc at the table.<br/><br/>Chris E's Matrix Games are essentially a refinement on this, with more formalization.<br/><br/>Interestingly, both Mugger Games and Matrix Games are, to a certain extent, a reaction to a desire for <b>even more</b> Simmy Goodness than wargames typically provide, in an easier-to-use format. <br/><br/>Howard is more of a "fun and cinematic-in-the-Saturday-Morning-Serials-sense" guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183956/#Comment_183956" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T11:10:46+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 11:10AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>When you're playing your own game, how do you decide which elements to include?

Okay, fast run-down (Cog Wars).<br/><br/>To do something with mechanics, you make a throw - opposed roll.  You name the things helping you, get dice for 'em, roll.  If you win, you say what happens.  Your opponent (person, place, or thing) can block your victory by taking a condition, which you describe.  If the condition is big enough, they can't block.<br/><br/>So far, so good?<br/><br/>Okay.  Now, <i>the group decides</i> if the actions of your character merit the victory.  The conditions you place can have intentions of their own if they get big enough (though the intentions are always hostile); conditions and intentions are <i>made up on the fly</i>.<br/><br/>The GM can also (or instead) go "hey, you can block with <i>duration</i>"; you can say that this victory-effect of their will only last such-and-so long - and that duration can be messed with, too.<br/><br/>So, I could decide to convince the local area to not like you.

Given these elements, being an umpire is easier than you might think!</b><br/> <br/>You do not need to be an expert on the Sudan, the British Army or, indeed anything at all. If your group contains someone who knows more than you, ask him to help run the scenario, or at least be supportive during the game when you announce that the Black Watch is a unit of African gentlemen with binoculars --- after all, you can read up on it later.<br/> <b>You do not have to know all the rules at one time (your humble game designer still doesn\u2019t!); </b>start out by emphasizing movement, melee and firing - disorder markers and visibility checks can wait. Work on making play flow smoothely. Roll dice for no reason and <b>get into the spirit of Free Kriegsspiel, which is German for making it up as you go along.</b> <br/> <br/>[snip]<br/>6)\tSet the tone for the game. Make sure the players are ready for a genial, \u201csocial\u201d kind of event. Some groups enjoy a roistering, \u201csilly hats and funny voices\u201d type of game, while others prefer a subdued, problem-solving approach with little overt role playing. Go with whatever fits the mood.<br/>[snip]<br/>11)\tAbove all, remember that the idea is for everyone to be entertained. This might mean \u2018hilarious fun\u2019 or \u2018nail-biting tension\u2019 or \u2018ironic commentary on the vanity of imperialism\u2019 or all-of-the-above. What matters is that the umpires and players should want to do it again, with fresh ideas and inspiration. <b>If you achieve that, it doesn\u2019t matter how many rules you got wrong or whether the historical research was spot-on.</b> Those things will look after themselves.

Those are two very, very different things in my book.<br/><br/>For example, consider that we're playing Sorcerer and your character has just been poisoned.  We want to know if you survive.  That could be a Will roll vs. a handful of GM chosen dice. That could be a Stamina roll vs. a handful of GM chosen dice.  It could be a Cover vs. Cover roll between your character and the person who poisoned you.  Which, all depends on the fictional context of the poisoning and the player's description of how they're dealing it with.<br/><br/>Just because we have to pick one based on our aesthetic commitment to the developing fiction doesn't mean we're "changing the rules."  We're applying the rules.<br/><br/>So you really mean *changing* the rules?

The closest thing I can think of is a toolkit game ,where the rules are quite explicit in saying that the game is in some very important sense not complete. So go finish it yo lazy bastards.<br/><br/>If that's what your going after than all the optional rules, rules fragments , rules that rhyme with lavender (including sidebars, panels and discussions about the true intent of the rule ) doesn't help you because your trying to codify a meta concern into the topic of the meta discussion. You said it yourself <br/><br/>First, I mean that many groups, in choosing to apply the mechanics they play with aesthetically, often act in contrast with the texts of the games they are playing. I don't think that's a strange statement at all.<br/><br/>if the joy is in being off the leash so to speak, how is a big book ful of leash gonna help. <br/><br/>it seems like your trying to write about the rules or some artistic thing when what your after is the boundry of it, While technically still part or related  of the original thing (rpg's and rpg texts), all that calvinballing (which does seem to be a bit of a missnomer ) is different from them. Like satire, I can tell a subverted text from the genuine. Starting with a subverted text doesn't change this. <br/><br/>Anyway those are my thoughts, best of luck with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184071/#Comment_184071" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T02:38:54+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  2:38AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2008 2:40AM by Hituro.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I agree that there isn't any point in making rules that support or encourage customization, it's a matter of conveying the ethics of your rule set, the things you think should matter in your rules-space (like the oft repeated "combat in this game is lethal" phrase, or the equivalence of successes and bonus dice in Sorcerer) so that when individual tables extrapolate your rules they do so in a way that keeps the game consistent with your original intents.<br/><br/>I mean often new rules fall naturally out of the rules described in the game text, without that meaning that the text is incomplete because it didn't have the rule before. If I know that a contested success in your game involves us rolling pools of dice until one of us accumulates a certain target number, and that penalties to this usually involve giving one or the other a penalty on each roll we do, then our group can have a particularly unfair contest resolved by giving each side a different target number of successes without breaking from the spirit of the mechanics. Does that rule need to be in the text? No ... because the rule in the text works fine too ... but I believe the text could be written to be more or less supportive of us adding that new rule and remaining in the spirit of the text.<br/><br/>So yes ... if you make a game that's amenable to change and customization then it will get customized, but the core mechanical-style probably will not. It's like how each game of Fluxx has totally different victory conditions and rule-sets, but those rules are built from a consistent toolbox, so that in each case we are still playing Fluxx.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184085/#Comment_184085" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T06:42:34+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  6:42AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Fluxx</blockquote>\nOh, <i>yeah</i>, man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184091/#Comment_184091" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T07:23:33+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  7:23AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2008 7:27AM by J_Walton.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Levi, have you seen my thread about rules teaching you how to break them?
