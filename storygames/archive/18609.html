While surfing the internet on rules light games i discovered this site and was intrigued by a lot of the posts.<br/> <br/>Recently i have had a trend of moving to games that are lighter on rules and allow the story to be less rigidly bound to the rules(you can't swing on the rope and draw your sword at the same time, it says so right here Player Book 3 page 1139 section 3, C) and allow more player creativity. After finding out about story games it seems like this is what i've been looking for all along.<br/><br/>I used to play with hardcore gamers but now i mostly gm for friends and family, my dad recently showed interest in playing with us but hes not going to sit and want to study a dusty tome to learn how to play.<br/><br/>so my question in a round about way is what story telling games are out there? which are highly recommended? my group tends to do a lot of different genres so universal rules would be great, but i'm open to a set genre as well if the rules are easy and its fun. also games where there is little to no prep by the gm would be great, possibly gm-less?(not necessary but i'd like to try it). if this isn't enough information id be glad to refine this. thanks for all help in advance.     <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418230/#Comment_418230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T12:03:56+00:00" title="July 12, 2013 12:03PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2013 12:06PM by James_Stuart.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there, welcome!

As you can imagine with games that take 2-3 hours prep that can be quite demanding. I had to tell them after a while we would have to take a break, because I was getting a little burnt out. After finding these little-to-no-prep-games I told them about it and they were excited to try them. I have to admit I'm a bit excited myself, as this means we can get back to gaming every night with much less demand on my time.<br/><br/>So thanks again for all of the suggestions, everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418239/#Comment_418239" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T12:50:01+00:00" title="July 12, 2013 12:50PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2013 12:56PM by mease19.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a>, it's no-prep, there are lots of <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/03/lady-blackbird-hacks.html" rel="nofollow">hacks</a> for different genres.

I think we're in similar boats--I've only really become interested in pursuing more story-game solutions to my RPGing in the last year. This was partly interest, and partly because two years of running Pathfinder burnt me out on high-prep, heavily crunchy rules where I had to fight the system to get player agency. And I ran a low-prep Pathfinder game! ;-)<br/><br/>As a bridge into story gaming (and one of the finest games ever written), I can't recommend Lady Blackbird enough. It's a graduate-level seminar on roleplaying games in 17 nifty pages! And immense fun to play and "run".<br/><br/>I've only read Apocalypse World, but it's bloody brilliant and will very likely change the way you look at RPGing, GMing...oh, everything. Including the sky. You. Will. Want. To. Run. It.<br/><br/>GUMSHOE games (<a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/site/?page_id=242" rel="nofollow">Trail of Cthulhu</a>, <a>The Esoterrorists</a>, <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=1081" rel="nofollow">Night's Black Agents</a> and a <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/" rel="nofollow">bunch of others</a>) make, IMHO, a nice bridge between older-style, crunchier games and more player-driven, lighter rules story gaming.<br/><br/>If you want to read the ongoing saga of this old dog trying to learn new tricks, check out my Actual Play thread wherein I try to run the classic <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i> under Trail of Cthulhu, meanwhile taking a crowbar to major sections of the module: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu#Item_189" rel="nofollow">The Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep</a>.<br/><br/>Fiasco is super-fun, and can be useful as a springboard to other systems--I used a Fiasco playset to kick off my Nyarlathotep campaign. If you want to gently introduce folks to RPGing, you'll not go wrong with Fiasco.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Drakon" title="Drakon"><img alt="Drakon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nFKC2362UBWY0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Drakon">Drakon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418250/#Comment_418250" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T14:03:18+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  2:03PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2013 2:03PM by Drakon.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a><br/><br/>lol, yes pathfinder is one of the systems i was referring to, not that its a bad game but like you said it burns you out.

Earl misplaced a trunk full of gold and he drinks so much he couldn't remember what he did with it, Leroy his partner was really mad; Earl thought he misplaced the trunk in town so Leroy went to find it, meanwhile the sheriff found it and told the deputy to hide it, Leroy finds the sheriff and asks if he saw Earl lately sheriff says he hadn't so Leroy tells him about the chest and if he finds it he will cut Earl out of his share and give it to the sheriff. Meanwhile the deputy and Earl are old friends so the deputy goes to Earl and offers to give the chest back to Earl if he will split it with him and take him back east. <br/><br/>then the tilt happened and it was all about settling scores, Earl wasn't even listening to the deputy anymore and set off to find Leroy. Leroy met the sheriff at boot hill who told him that he had the gold but he wanted a 70-30 split because he was going to cut his deputy out. Leroy got mad and told the sheriff he better watch his back and went in to town looking for the deputy. Earl meanwhile had found the gold buried at boothill and took the gold and rigged the chest with dynamite and was hiding away off with the plunger waiting for the first person to try and retrieve it. the sheriff got the drop on earl and they fought, Earl got the upper hand and tied the sheriff to the trunk(lol) but tripped on some ropes and had the plunger underneath him and couldn't move without setting it off. Leroy found the deputy and asked him if he knew where the gold was, that he knew the sheriff had him hide it. the deputy acted dumb so earl punched him grabbed his gun and locked him in a cell, and went to find the sheriff. the deputy got free grabbed a billyclub out of his desk and went after Leroy. Leroy arrived on the seen and saw the gold loaded on a horse with the sheriff and the earl in trouble, he went over and decided to help Earl because they had been partners, they both decided the sheriff was to blame and blew him up, the deputy got there just in time for the fireworks, and tried to sneak up on them but he was seen and got pistol whipped and left in the dust as Earl and Leroy rode off.<br/><br/>In the aftermath, Earl and Leroy where on a train Leroy found out Earl had been stealing from him and threw him off the train and earl was last seen being chased by Indians. Leroy was chased by posse's for killing the sheriff, and was caught and lost the gold.<br/>The deputy became the new sheriff and actually improved the town.<br/><br/>We didn't really know what to do with the sheriff since he was gone.<br/><br/>All in all we had a really good time, and now that we know the rules things will go smoother next time.<br/><br/>I had a chance to look over some of the other games and will try running them soon too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418283/#Comment_418283" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T17:29:05+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  5:29PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of curiosity - aside from enjoying themselves (which is great!), how did they react to the style of gameplay?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Drakon" title="Drakon"><img alt="Drakon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nFKC2362UBWY0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Drakon">Drakon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418284/#Comment_418284" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T18:02:01+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  6:02PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">@cucumberkappa</a><br/><br/>lol, well at first they were a little shy, they're used to waiting for me to describe a scene to them and they choose what they want to do, look at the skill, roll, and i tell them what happens. Well when we finished the setup, they were all looking at me like what now? lol. I told one of the players that it was his turn, and he had to either make the scene or let others do it for him, as soon as the other players heard this they all glared evilly at him, he promptly decided to frame the scene himself.<br/><br/>It took him a little while he suggested a few things then changed his mind, once he finished i told him it was alright the first scene is the hardest and he did a good job. the other players picked things up from each-other pretty quickly and pretty soon we had to put a limit on how long a scene could be (one player was still going after 15 mins, the shy one lol).<br/><br/>After the tilt we all talked about about the mechanics of the game, there was a little confusion on how giving someone a die worked, one player wanted to know did you give it to the player after his narration or during, and another wondered if the players that give the die get to decide what happens to the current character.<br/><br/>It was much different then our normal games but they adjusted and got more interested in telling a story then worrying about rules, by act 2 they were confident and hooked.<br/><br/>Overall id call it a great success as they asked me to run it again soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418287/#Comment_418287" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T18:58:36+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  6:58PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks very much!

Every game is a mystery, but because the players have so much creative input, no one knows how the mystery will be solved until the mystery is solved.<br/>  Dogs in the Vineyard is another game where players have the ability to create game-world content moreso than other games.

You won't be dissapointed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418644/#Comment_418644" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-18T17:57:39+00:00" title="July 18, 2013  5:57PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, TBZ is not that conventional.

Gameplay split up into scenes and acts.<br/>5. An experience system that directly rewards players chasing after their goals, dramatic roleplaying, and being badass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo" title="Maese_Mateo"><img alt="Maese_Mateo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/897/nVSZHDY85YP2W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo">Maese_Mateo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418669/#Comment_418669" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-19T06:48:08+00:00" title="July 19, 2013  6:48AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's why I said it's somewhere in the middle.

But don't despair, since that is a lot less than you think since the book isn't of traditional A4/Letter size, but rather smaller (and you don't even need to read the whole thing, I've storytelled TBZ a couple of times in the past, and I've started to read the setting book cover to cover just a week ago). For the rulebook itsef, around 80 pages or so (maybe even less) are actual rules, the rest is just explanations of each "power" subsystem (shinto rituals, yoroi armours, samurais, etc), gives you playable archetypes, pregens and other extra content you don't actually need to read if it's not going to appear on your game.<br/><br/>For a player it's a lot easier: make them read the manga at the start of the setting book (30 pages), and they'll know eveything they need to select characters and play. The rules are also sumarized by a series of mangas with examples (around 10 pages), and that's all they need to start as well, you can explain everything else on the fly as it becomes relevant. Since the book comes with pregens, you don't need to invest time making character (although that only takes around 5 to 10 minutes since it's just stacking archetypes, not a big deal). But the pregens are very cool, so you can use them over and over again just fine.<br/><br/>The only thing that you can't probably make on the fly is the basic framework for the scenario (how an adventure is called in TBZ), since it's important that the GM has at least some idea of what's going to happen on each Act (a scenario usually has 3 or 4 Acts), particularly to roleplay the Zero Act (a small prelude for each character, where you asign each character his Destiny for the scenario). Other than that, you can improvise just fine (I know I have =P).<br/><br/><br/>And seriously, if you enjoy anime, give it a shot, it's one of the best  game I've played in years (and I don't even like anime that much, but the game is amazing). You can purchase the PDFs for just $14, and if you want to grab the physical copy later (which comes with the PDFs for free), I think Andy is discounting the PDF price from the physical purchase, so it's a great deal, IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo" title="Maese_Mateo"><img alt="Maese_Mateo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/897/nVSZHDY85YP2W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo">Maese_Mateo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418739/#Comment_418739" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-20T17:38:01+00:00" title="July 20, 2013  5:38PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2013 5:39PM by Maese_Mateo.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a visual way to introduce people to the game, I like to use <a href="http://youtu.be/ECOq6aydx1k" rel="nofollow">this Samurai 7 fanmade trailer</a> (that series has a lot in common with TBZ aesthetically).<br/><br/>Anyway, if you have any other questions about TBZ, I'm glad to help. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
