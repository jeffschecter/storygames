Within this challenge participants must design, create, play and talk about a game all before the month's end. The challenge is over now and I am so pleased to say I that I successfully slayed the DeMon! <br/><br/>Say hello to <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/140769/Trials-of-the-Magi" rel="nofollow">Trials of the Magi</a><br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/140769/Trials-of-the-Magi" rel="nofollow">Trials of the Magi</a> is a tabletop roleplaying game [RPG] as well as an alternate reality game [ARG]. Within the game players are told of a secret world of magic, similar to the world of Harry Potter. These players are also told that they have the potential to join this arcane society, but only if they prove themselves worthy by completing a set of trials. These trials take the form of a tabletop RPG in which players control a projection of themselves called a Persona. While looking and acting like the player, This Persona may not have the same attributes and skills the Person they are based on. Being a mental projection the qualities of a Persona are derived from the players personality, psyche and knowledge opposed to their physical characteristics. The other major difference between the Persona and the player is that the Persona has the power to control the arcane and cast spells. <br/><br/>These spells are the focus of the system as it's free-form and open nature allows players to use it for almost any interaction. It should also be noted that just like with the Persona's qualities, a players affinity to the different schools of magic is also base upon their psyche and knowledge.<br/><br/>If this concept Interests you at all please check it out at the link above. If you have any thoughts questions or suggestions about the system please post them in this thread, as I will be further developing this system in the upcoming months [prior to taking it to print]. If you have any specific questions about the rules or its design, feel free to post in this thread or PM me, I am always happy to chat!<br/><br/>Thanks a bunch!<br/>-Patrick                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
