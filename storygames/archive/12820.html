"seed rpg" is the frame work my sci-fi games will have in common. so when i make a smuggler's game (firefly), the content will be compatible with the bounty hunters game so they can fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other goal is to make something accessible, Something that will reach people who are not currently playing role playing games but would if they had a gateway game. Something that can do what "settlers" and "ticket to ride" did for strategy games. I'm not compromising what i like about rpgs to do this, I'm trying to address what keeps myself from playing more rpgs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I'm doing is formatting the game as a deck of cards and using a few components to keep track of numbers and such, there will be a rule book but it's limited in use, sort of like how you use a rule book for a board game, (you wont look at it much after your first game)<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of what I'm doing is inspired by a whole lot of the games I have got to play and read from this community. The main goal of seed is to inspire people and share stories with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288612/#Comment_288612" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T22:22:40+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 10:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>I'm not compromising what i like about rpgs to do this, I'm trying to address what keeps myself from playing more rpgs.</blockquote>\nDoes play time factor into this for <b>seed rpg</b>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288627/#Comment_288627" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T01:02:53+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  1:02AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 2:53AM by TylerT.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, my goal for session length is about two hours, it's something i'm getting much closer too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe important thing to me about time investment is prep time.

Learning is even harder if there are no visual aids or physical objects for procedure to attach it's self to in the player's mind. while I would absolutely love to buy more story games I always have a hard time because of how hard it is for me to take text and extract a game from it. I'm far more likely to buy an rpg if I can play it first, mostly because that makes it 100% easier for me to get my own game going.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo draw an example of what a component shift is capable of look at Mageknight. Before it most miniatures games kept all their rules in one fat book. But then mageknight exploded, it took what was exciting about miniatures games and made it accessible. and while that game is dead today, almost all popular miniatures games (pre-painted or not) take component design seriously. Mageknight and it's click wheel base was something of a resurgence for the whole category of miniatures games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said there are many possible ways to use components that do not make a game more accessible. Like if you try to translate a usual big fat source book into a component based game your going to end up with a box that costs near $100 bucks. That is why i'm taking the whole "seed rpg" branding approach. if seed rpg were traditional fat source book, bounty hunters (0 hunters) would just be a chapter on how to run a bounty hunting campaign, along with chapters to run smugglers, black ops, space pirates, and so on. as a component based game i can break these apart and make each thing it's own self contained game for around 20-30 bucks retail.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thats just the "hard product" accessibility, i'm really happy with how the rules are shaping up as far as accessibility but i will be posting on that later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288669/#Comment_288669" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T07:20:37+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  7:20AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your other <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.papercrafted.com/" rel="nofollow">papercraft kit blog</a> is also pretty cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289277/#Comment_289277" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T18:28:54+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  6:28PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2010 6:30PM by TylerT.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks jenskot!<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted another entry, i will just re-post it here so people wont need to click the link.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="choserolltell.jpg?w=458&amp;h=376" class="bbcode_img" src="http://seedrpg.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/choserolltell.jpg?w=458&amp;h=376"/><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I sit down to playtest with an experienced role player there is something I need to explain clearly, this is how actions are chosen and resolved while playing SEED RPG. There are some foundational changes to this because of how the game uses rules to inspire a story.<br/>\n<br/>\nA usual rpg follows the TELL, CHOSE, ROLL sequence. The player will TELL the GM what they want to accomplish, the GM will CHOSE what rules are in effect and then the player will ROLL to find the outcome of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nSEED RPG changes this sequence, the player CHOSES a game play option, ROLLS to find the outcome and TELLS a story that reflects the outcome of the action. For example take a look at the actions available during a fight on this card.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="fightcard.jpg?w=458&amp;h=376" class="bbcode_img" src="http://seedrpg.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fightcard.jpg?w=458&amp;h=376"/><br/>\n<br/>\nIf it's your turn you will usually have access to these four actions as well as actions provided by your items or traits. The name of each action is clearly displayed in the black bar, along with it's action and die type (action type is the circle, die type is the square) . Under the black bar are the possible effects the action may provide.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets say it's the start of a fight task. The GM's character will act first and he chose the \u201cmove it\u201d action, he rolls the character's dice indicated by the action (agility and sense) and his roll is successful enough to get the \u201cRun away\u201d effect, this gives him one point of advantage and the effect listed. after applying the efect he would tell the story of what happened, something like \u201cThe bounty head is relaxing in the crowded pavilion, as you approach he catches a glimpse of your rifle and can tell your on the hunt so he bolts, shoving his way into a crowd of people\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it's your turn, the effect attached to \u201cRun away\u201d means the bounty head is immune to \u201cclose\u201d action types (that\u2019s what the funny symbol is for), so logical y actions like \u201chand to hand\u201d have no effect against a target that is running away. You could chose to perform the \u201ctaunt\u201d action, or try \u201cmoving it\u201d yourself. But like I said you have a rifle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="god-that-art-is-ugly.jpg?w=458&amp;h=376" class="bbcode_img" src="http://seedrpg.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/god-that-art-is-ugly.jpg?w=458&amp;h=376"/><br/>\n<br/>\nYou pick the aim and shoot option and your dice roll well enough to get the \u201cfrighten\u201d effect. It's a strait 3 damage to the target's advantage. You could then narrate your turn like this \u201cI see him run into the crowd so I take out my rifle and fire a shot into the air and yell \u201cget down or get shot people, we\u2019re bounty hunters!\u201d the pedestrians drop down, leaving a clear line for me to take a few shots in the bounty head's direction. One knocks off his hat making causing him to hesitate and trip over a cowering pedestrian\u201d This cycle of \u201cchose, roll, tell\u201d continues to build the scene, until one side loses their advantage points.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith \u201cchose, roll, tell\u201d the story is built around rules and effects. To accommodate this the rules do not try and model a particular time scale or realism, the rules are based around exciting character choices, and a system that models how stories are told. This is one way rules inspire a story with seed rpg.<br/>\n<br/>\nHug party,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tyler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
