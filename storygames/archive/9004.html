(Yes, I mention the sunny beach mostly to inspire jealousy from my fellow Seattlites.) One of the chapters focusing on Sibelius starts with this description of composition:\n<blockquote>Composing is a difficult business. "Desperately difficult," says the devil in <i>Doctor Faustus</i>. Is is a laborious traversal of an imaginary landscape. What emerges is artwork in code, which other musicians must be persuaded to unravel. Unlike a novel or a painting, a score gives up it's full meaning only when it is performed in front of an audience; it is a child of loneliness the lives off crowds. Nameless terrors creep into the limbo between composition and performance, during which the score site mutely on the desk. Hans Pfitzner dramatized that moment of panic and doubt in <i>Palestrina</i>, his "musical legend" about the life of the Italian Renaissance composer. The character of Palestrina speaks for colleagues across the centuries when he stops his work to cry, "What is the point of all this? <i>Ach</i>, what is it for, What for?"</blockquote>\nIt struck me that this is a pretty good description of writing a game, and gaming in general. John Harper and I brainstormed some more similarities here, the analogy actually suggests some interesting parallels. Will gaming ever have an audience? <br/><br/>I think there's also some potential here for explaining gaming. It's kind of like an orchestral performance: there's a score to keep everyone in the same key and in the same theme, but there's plenty of room for each conductor and performer to leave their mark. It's a group activity that also allows for virtuoso performances by individuals, and so on.<br/><br/>I mostly wanted to share my thoughts and provoke some discussion, but here's some questions too: is this a good metaphor for gaming, and writing games in particular? Does it suggest interesting ideas for where gaming may move in the future?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NPC" title="NPC"><img alt="NPC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://nathanaelcole.com/_pics/me/spider.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NPC">NPC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198980/#Comment_198980" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T17:14:36+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  5:14PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2009 5:15PM by NPC.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Will gaming ever have an audience?<br/></blockquote>\n<br/>In some ways, it already has.  There are already a few movies based on gamers, including the eponymous "The Gamers" and a few variations of that theme.  One could argue that the purpose of these is primarily to make fun of the hobby, but I disagree, as the aforementioned movie was primarily a comedy directed <i>towards</i> its audience - the audience being its very subject matter.<br/><br/>But then you have TV shows wherein you watch people actually play through games like Madden and various others.  A few channels televise video game tournaments as if they were football games.  At the same time, several podcasts are recording their entire play sessions and sharing them with an audience.  How much further, then until tabletop game sessions are specifically organized <i>for</i> those recordings, and we start seeing "named players" in various live tabletop events?<br/><br/>And in such cases I wonder, how would the preparation for these specific "audience-based" game sessions differ from any normal session?  Would the prep for these sessions grow to more closely resemble the prep for a musical performance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
