I have it (yay, me!), and I think it'd be nice to put it somewhere for general access.  A thread on the Forge tried to do that, but all the links posted there appear dead.  So...I'd like to post it to the PTA page on the new RPG Geek.  But I'd like to make sure I do it properly, and ask the creator for permission.  He originally posted it for everyone to access, so if I don't get it I'd still be OK with posting it, but I have to try, right?<br/><br/>The original poster on the Forge was the user "chrisn".  He hasn't been active there for two years.  Yeah, I could ask there, but I haven't registered at the Forge yet, and would rather not.  Can anyone here help get me in contact with "chrisn"?<br/><br/>And while I'm at it:  Matt Wilson, would you mind my posting this on RPG Geek?  No, it's not your PDF, but it's based on your material.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
