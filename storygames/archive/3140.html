You'll need to playtest the whole game at some point, but you can start with just the basics and then add the elaborated rules in later iterations.<br/><br/>If you can record the session -- video or audio -- that's good stuff.<br/><br/>I tend to go for hardcore playtests and tell the players to try and break the game.  However, there is a catch to this in that some games require a certain level of buy-in that gamebreaking is totally at odds with.  Figure out if the game really needs players to invest and care on their own before asking them to consider the game in a dispassionate and analytical fashion (dispassionate and analytical can happen after play, anyway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71705/#Comment_71705" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T13:20:19+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  1:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>If you can record the session -- video or audio -- that's good stuff.</blockquote>\nJeff has found this very useful in his playtests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71711/#Comment_71711" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T13:26:47+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  1:26PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2007 1:27PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited to note that this cross-posted with Christian and others]<br/>\n<br/>\nBe prepared for people to try to break the game - in fact they may even ask if it's OK to do so. For a certain sort of geek like myself it's fun to stress-test the rules and see what taking the extreme options does to play. This is actually pretty useful, but can make play suck, like Judd says. The goal of this is to tell you where you may have to shore up limitations and such, or create different ranges of options.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one is difficult, but... try not to "fill in the blanks" for the players. That is, if you're one of the designers, then you know how the game is supposed to play. Try to only deliver information that's actually in the book. Even if this is a tad stilted. People playing will not have you or any of the designers there when they play. So they won't have their gaps filled in by somebody who knows the intent of the game. That has to come from the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this is so difficult (impossible to do perfectly, really), this is why you also must do independent playtesting where everybody running and playing have only the text to work from. Yeah, sure, if you're available to people online you can fix some perceptions. But the quality of the text is precisely in how little they have to contact you to figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Judd says, getting feedback is important. That said, a good technique (one I've only used a couple of times, but works well) is to have people write down comments on paper right after the game ends. Some folks will find this to be a bit of a bore, and won't want to do it. But see if you can get them to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for doing this is the same reason that police take statements from witnesses individually. Which is that if you do it in a group feedback session, players perceptions tend to get altered by social patterns. People start to agree with each other, and not state differing perceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have gathered their separate feedback, then you can put them together to get group feedback. This actually has it's own benefits. So do both.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71713/#Comment_71713" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T13:31:37+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  1:31PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the tips, fellas.  Since this is our first-ever playtest, I (the writer) will be leading the testing for now, as I'm not sure how well-written it is just yet for another to understand the flow.  I've got some basic rules concepts for printing and handing out, but not enough to explain how to run it to someone new.<br><br>I will definitely be recording this session.  I even bought a conference mic just for the purpose.  I'll be running it at a new local game store, too.  The place mainly focuses on the money-makers (D20, magic, minis, etc), but they welcome smaller games too, and I'm hoping that by getting some more indie-minded gamers around they will see the benefit of appealing to that crowd too.<br><br>Currently, I've got the following idea for sequencing:<br><br>1. Start with a round of introductions, and then explain what I'm looking to do with this session<br>2. Begin the actual testing with pre-generated characters, putting the players in a situation to test the basics of the rules, and also allowing them to get the feel of the core themes and concepts in play.  Additionally, they'd get more used to the character sheet I've designed.<br>3. After a bit of testing the rules, then we'd start from scratch and create characters together.<br>4. If there is time after that, I want to try and run them through the mini-scenario a second time, this time with the new characters.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71719/#Comment_71719" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T14:12:01+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  2:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>If you're brave, you'll let someone else run the game using only the text provided to them, no further advice or techniques that you give them.<br><br>You need to do this sooner or later, anyway, and it depends on the state of your draft whether that would work or not.</br></br></blockquote>\nYou definitely need to do it, but it should wait until you've got the text to the point that you feel the game is finished.Then let the blind playtesters show you everything you thought was in there but isn't.<br><br>At this early stage, what the players say they have problems (while still worthy of attention) is less important than what you see them doing at the table.

If you say, "I know this is gonna suck, but . . . " you might set people up to agree with you. I think it's fine to make it clear that it's rough, but that you hope to have fun.<br/><br/>Design the scenario or guide the game toward testing the parts of the game you think might be weakest or that you have questions on. Since this is your first test, use every part of the buffalo (see if you can get every part of the game played). Joshua disagrees but I think maybe you can touch on everything. If you can't, if the game's too big, don't stretch things and make an unfun play experience to achieve the buffalo-usage. If you don't get to use every part, try to make sure the parts you didn't use get used in the next playtest along with all the stuff you changed and are excited about.<br/><br/>Solicit feedback in a structured way. Have a series of feedback questions to ask ahead of time rather than just "what did you think?" You might want to dump those questions in this thread and get them critiqued. Also if anyone is quiet, ask them what they thought. If they're uncomfortable talking, ask them to email you. Invite people to email you anything they'd rather not say in-group.<br/><br/>I think it might be more useful to record the after-game bull session than the game itself (if you had to choose, which you don't, which is just to say I think that's the more interesting part to listen to later and the part you're more likely to forget).<br/><br/>On the recording front, pay attention to what you tell people and if the game is successful, make sure that whatever you said gets textualized and used in the rules. Judd says a version of this above.<br/><br/>Don't be stubborn about killing your babies, but don't assume that everything that everyone says is equally valid. My second playtest had a very vocal person who had ideas for the game that were very different from mine and it was hard not to get demoralized or add badwrongstuff to it. I managed, though, I think.<br/><br/>I do not think you have to bring a functioning text to the game.
