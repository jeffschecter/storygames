This is a setting me and my group have just put together for a new campaign of Other Worlds, this time based around the idea of doing a really epic fantasy saga (that's eventually going to turn into a global conflict a la the War of the Ring). It's a fair bit more detailed than is usually needed, and we ended up fleshing out the player characters afterwards via email, but most of this was done in one session. I would love to see other people post similar examples of their own! <br/><br/><b>The World of Amar</b><br/><br/><b>Broad Concept</b><br/>An epic fantasy quest with many different factions, like in LotR or Babylon 5. <br/>Politics, economics, and tensions between different factions should be a factor. A war is brewing.<br/>The game starts in a neutral place between the races like Babylon 5 or the UN. A treaty city.<br/>The characters are all representatives/champions of their races like the Fellowship of the Ring.<br/>Some kind of common enemy has emerged that threatens all the free peoples<br/>The characters are put together on a mission to stop it<br/>Everyone has a special reason to be on the mission - some quality or power that will be needed<br/>Characters may also be pushed/manipulated by their own faction who may have a separate agenda?<br/>Threat could be a new land mass emerging from the sea - a relic of ancient times? 'The Tenth Kingdom'. A returned god? Some strange and powerful items might have been salvaged from this place already.<br/>Or a new evil religion - led by an Osama Bin Thulsa Doom type figure. A false prophet. The rise of this cult could be what is causing the war (religious vs secular?). He could be an avatar or have some special item.<br/>Or demons, planar invasion, dragons (allied to the forces on the island maybe?), gnomes, etc<br/><br/><b>Tone</b><br/>More serious than comic (where possible). Magic is low key. Gritty. Characters can get hurt, even killed<br/><br/><b>History</b><br/>Legends of the creation of the world<br/>Unseelie war<br/>The evernight<br/>The Age of Darkness - lasted 3,000 years<br/>Now = The Age of Twilight<br/>Once a year the unseelie come back on winter solstice - longest night of the year<br/>The unseelie have their sport - consume life, keep races down<br/>Next = age of the sun? or age of darkness? - could go either way<br/><br/>Recent events:<br/>New landmass emerges - its a prophecy or just discovered by ogres<br/>Vision, ancient scroll<br/>Lights of the world are getting dim<br/>The dwarves have discovered something?<br/>Ogres want to cross the great ocean<br/><br/><b>Geography</b><br/>Huge staircase going down<br/>frozen wastes<br/>remnants of old civilisations<br/>giant statue of unknown origin<br/>city on stilts in marshland<br/>incan temple in the firests (tie to beastmen?)<br/><br/>city states<br/>treaty city - mos eisley-like lawless ankh moorpork<br/>valley of the dead<br/><br/>Seas, lakes<br/>An island<br/>Gates/dimensional rift<br/>Woods/forests<br/>the underdark<br/>swamp<br/>floating rock cities in the sky<br/>volcanos<br/>Mordor<br/>Indiana Jones-style dungeon/temple<br/>A tunnel between two races (like the channel tunnel) as the surface is very dangerous<br/><br/>other continents are held at bay by some sort of magic barrier \u2013 invisible mist which sweeps ships away like bermuda triangle myths; <br/><br/>lots of dangerous/strange animals<br/>centipedes<br/>six legged riding cats - ridden by beastmen, minotaurs - fox guys, bull guys<br/>flying monkeys<br/>treehounds<br/>Silly animal hybrids - rhinoroo, paul the dogtopus, duck-billed badgerpuss<br/>Drakh keepers<br/>Weird mounts<br/>Unusual species abound - normal stuff like cats and dogs simply don't exist<br/><br/><b>Technology</b><br/>Primitve tech - swords and shields and bows. Not a lot of armour. Chariots. Catapults. <br/>Night steel/cold iron - dwarves invented after industrialisation - found the secret of reliably creating it.<br/>Conan, Runequest, bronze age feel<br/><br/>Strange riding beasts as transports<br/>Lizardmen - Star Wars lizard (from Revenge of the Sith).<br/>Ogres - ships, dolphins, walk on land. Sea lubbers - prefer sea to land. Flying stingrays. <br/>Dwarves - giant worms - tunnel underground. ride them like in Dune.<br/>Faeries - giant dragonflies, lots of giant insects in their home forests. Unseelie ride horses in hunt.<br/><br/><b>Magic</b><br/>Celtic style magic - leylines, faerie toadstool rings, dolmens and stone circles, potions/cauldrons, pagan nature worship, rituals, poisons, scrying the future, subtle magic rather than obvious fireballs, runes, weather influence, influencing natural world, speak to animals, cause fear, curses. <br/>Harness power<br/>superhuman jumps<br/>rituals, grimoires, sacrifices<br/>alchemical<br/>morgoth/sauron-like - drain energy from self<br/>spirits<br/>leyline at midsummer's eve<br/>faerie glamour - appear as other things<br/>black obselisk<br/><br/>Different races draw energy in different ways<br/>Dwarves draw energy from ley lines, which tap into the spirit world, stone circles and chasms - leaks up to the surface from the Earth's core<br/>Ogres - where it's stormiest (ley lines). Small rocky island where the sages live - Isle of the Sorcerers. <br/>Some live on boats - The Waterbound<br/>Lizardmen = magic from smoke - rituals, capturing it. firestones. Look into the smoke = see into the other realm<br/>Faeries: faerie gateways, wardstones - portals into the other realm<br/><br/>Failure = drains own energy/lifespan? attracts unseelie?<br/>Unseelie give magical energy when destroyed<br/>Dead spots where magic has been drained away<br/><br/><b>Factions</b><br/>There are 4 races on Amar, representing the 4 elements.<br/><br/>Richard's race: The Ohmryn<br/>Ogre-like in appearance. 7-8 feet tall, strong and tough like Conan.

The Faetouched are very unhappy about all of these things. <br/><br/>Fire vs Water = clash over the seas between their lands. The Kasheeta call it the Strait of Muldrasa, while the Ohmryn call it the Alamin Channel. The Ohmryn have spirit bonds with many sea creatures that live in these waters, from sharks and whales to dolphins and octopuses. But the Kasheeta hunt them for food and also for food (a lot like the Japanese and whaling). This is a big source of conflict. <br/><br/><b>Game Length</b><br/>One 'movie length' adventure - about 12 sessions.<br/><br/><b>Player Characters</b><br/>We said that we've done games at the lower power level so we should try something a bit more epic and fantastical.

I thought I would post the ongoing journal of what's happened but also add in some notes about the game mechanics side or any other bits of play advice I learned from the experience. <br/><br/><b>Worldbuilding Summary</b><br/>On the world of Amar there are four great races, each drawing their power from one of the four elements. The Basites embody the element of earth; they are dwarves with bodies made of raw stone, known for their love of mining and solitary, stubborn disposition. The Kasheeta are scaly grey-green lizardmen who embody the element of fire; they are deeply religious and consider volcanos to be the most sacred places in the world. The Ohmryn are great blue seafaring ogres who embody the element of water; they are honourable traders famous for their laid back attitudes, but can be stormy if wronged. The Phae-Touched are small and insect-like faeries who embody the element of air; they all share a direct connection to the Hive Prime and live in an alliance with the Wildren beastmen. <br/><br/>The current Age of Twilight has lasted for thousands of years. The whole world is dark and gloomy and full daylight is considered a faerie tale of the olden days. Relations between the four races are fractious at best; disputes are handled in the Great Council chambers in the neutral ground of Sanctuary Island. The most common source of trouble are the unseelie, who raid the free peoples of Amar every winter solstice and cause untold amounts of pain and suffering.   <br/><br/><b>Character Summary</b><br/>Goldrock of the Basites is a Runesmith Guilder with all the elemental powers of a Stormforger Runesmith. His key abilities include Beacon to the Unseelie, Build the Ultimate WMD, Call Lightning, Feared, Granite Skin, Nightsteel Armour, Reduced Senses, Rune Lore, See Through Illusions, and Tremor Sense.<br/><br/>Zhel'darax of the Kasheetans is Captain of their noble order of Fire Guardians. He was raised on sacred Mount Hilipha is an Acolyte of Cyratha (a dreamseer). His key abilities include Apprenticed by the Oracle, Burn Infidel, Cold Blooded, Filter Smoke, Impart Wisdom, Lonely Widower, Read Object, and Step Between Moments.<br/><br/>Sharl of the Ohmryn is a hunter with a spiritual connection to a berserker shark spirit named Ghar. His key abilities include Avoid Unnecessary Violence, Blackouts and Memory Loss, Dislikes Dishonesty, Treated with Suspicion, Uneasy When Away From the Sea, and Wielder of the Relic Spear Haon-Sri-Hu.<br/><br/>Fleet of the Phae-Touched is a Way Warden of En Jaides who was promoted to the status of Greysmith Mediator. His key abilities include Connected to the Web of Life, Fascinated by Mortals, Hero of Mherun Vale, Insectoid Wings, Saddened by Violence, Treestep, Vulnerable to Night Steel, andWindshard Staff of Office.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405786/#Comment_405786" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T09:03:40+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  9:03AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>1. Prophecy</b><br/>The four heroes were summoned to the Partitioned City on Sanctuary Island. <b>[1]</b><br/><br/>Fleet was the first to arrive. He had spent the last few years travelling the world, mediating in disputes with both the Wildren and the Basites. He flew in from the Wychlight Forest on a giant dragonfly, landing by the great termite mounds in one of the Phae-Touched quarter's many parks. <br/>Sharl came next. He had recently been helping to block Kasheetan hunting expeditions in the contested waters of the Alamin Channel when an argument escalated into violence and he killed several Kasheetans.  This had led to increased tensions between the two races and Sharl knew that things could easily tip over into all-out war if he was not careful. He arrived at the bustling docks of Sanctuary Island's Ohmryn quarter by boat, heading inland through the canals and passing its famously colourful stilted wooden houses on the way. <br/><br/>Zhel'darax had been busy meditating at home near Mount Hilipha in preparation for being entered into the Order of Siratha next year. He had also been helping train his daughter Lyzara train so she can attempt the gruelling initiation rites of the illustrious Fire Guardians, an order he is himself a Captain of. He arrived at the island by boat and immediately sought out one of the round stone temples in the Kasheetan quarter so he could filter holy smoke and clear his mind. <br/><br/>Goldrock came last. He had been very busy in his homeland chopping down woodlands and strip mining ('landscaping') the lands near the border with the Phae-Touched, in order to provide enough fuel for the creation of some new war machines. No fan of boats, Goldrock had arrived by simply walking along the sea bed. He emerged in the polluted workshops and narrow gothic streets of the Basite quarter looking sodden and exhausted. <br/><br/>All four characters then made their way to the Sanctuary Temple itself to meet with their respective race's ambassadors and discuss recent events. The temple was essentially a large dome built over the sacred circle of standing stones that provides much of the island's natural arcane power. Powerful runes of warding protect this holy site from potential attack. Soon enough the heroes and their advisors were summoned to a council meeting in the adjoining chamber. <br/><br/>The seer of Sanctuary Island, a venerable Phae-Touched called Swiftstream, laid out the reason for the summons. With the winter solstice fast approaching all four races had begun to suffer from raids by the Unseelie on outlying villages. But this year was different. This year was the year of prophecy, the year of the Grand Convergence when the moon aligns perfectly with the sun. As had been foretold over a thousand years ago, this was the time when the Unseelie would launch their biggest attacks yet, when they would make their great play for the control - or destruction - of the world. Would the current Age of Twilight be replaced by a glorious new Age of the Sun - or a terrible new Age of Darkness?<br/><br/>Our four heroes were the chosen ones, a fact signified by the birthmarks they bore carrying the rune of their people's sacred element. What could they do to help save their peoples? Swiftstream read out the Scroll of the Prophet:<br/><br/>When the sky turns red with blood<br/>And the darkness surrounds us all<br/>Four heroes will emerge<br/>Bearing the hearts of their people<br/>And the keys of their fathers<br/>And step forward to claim their destinies<br/><br/>Last night the sky had indeed turned red as blood, so there could be no doubt that this was the signified time. Scholars had debated endlessly over the full meaning of the ancient scroll, but the 'keys of their fathers' line was a clear reference to each race's sacred elemental key - the Firestone Amulet of the Kasheetans, the Gate Key of the Phae Touched, the Unbreakable Pickaxe of the Basites, and the Echo Shell of the Ohmyrn.  These keys would have to be collected from their appointed guarding places and given to the heroes for use in the battles to come. The line about the 'hearts of their people' had been taken to mean that if any of the chosen ones fell, or if any of the sacred keys were captured by the enemy, the race in question would face a rapid and terrible decline (not to say destruction) regardless of the outcome of the larger war. <br/><br/>The full council meeting began. As per tradition, only the individual bearing the speaking stone, a heavy piece of basalt carried by a frail and diminutive looking Phae-Touched clerk, would be allowed to speak <b>[2]</b>. The clerk fluttered around the room, passing the stone round to those that signalled for it. But many other issues were raised before this most important of crises could be addressed. Ambassador Snowfall for the Phae Touched rose to complain about Basite pollution and tree felling, calling on the council to sanction them for their actions. The Basite ambassador in turn rose to defend the merits of Basite industry and tried to portray the Phae Touched as enemies of progress. The Kasheetan ambassador rose to condemn Ohmryn acts of aggression in the contested waters of the Strait of Muldrasa, while the Ohmryn condemned the Kasheetan's repeated hunting parties into the same waters (which they call the Alamin Channel) and threatened a repeat of such blockades in the future. Discussion turned into debate and debate turned into all-out argument.<br/><br/>In the end Goldrock had had enough. He rose to his feet and slammed his mighty hammer down onto the table. 'Order, order!' he cried. 'We must discuss the seer's prophecies while there is still time to do something about them!'. <b>[3]</b><br/><br/>Swiftstream asked the council for permission to use the sacred stone of seeing, to understand more about the threat they faced. There was also the question of how long they should look into the stone - the more time they spent, the bigger the risk that some kind of magical backlash would take place. After a vote the assembled council agreed to use the stone on full power, regardless of the risk, and so all parties reconvened in the great stone circle itself. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405787/#Comment_405787" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T09:03:54+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  9:03AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Swiftstream looked into the stone. 'I see a vision of an island emerging from the depths of the ocean', he said. 'It is shielded, somehow. It lies to the north west, beyond the mists. It is a place of great magical energy. It beckons us, we must go to it and find out what is there'. Pushing harder, he said 'I can see some sort of structure on it, made of black stone. There is a terrible stench of death there.' <br/><br/>'The worldbound unseelie stir in the darkness. Four dark princes watch from beyond the realm. A black-armoured figure riding a two-headed pterodactyl. A towering figure of orange rock with six spider-like legs. A black-sailed ship covered in severed heads on spikes. A flaming man on a great chariot, pulled by giant steel bulls. A great needle-like tower stands over a dark and twisted city.'<br/><br/>'I see Kasheetan soldiers marshalling for war, clad in strange armour and bearing strange and powerful weapons. I see a squid-faced unseelie striding through the Phae-Touched capital, leaving puddles of dark water in his wake. I see a great fleet of Ohmryn setting sail, their prospects uncertain. I see the Basite capital fall totally silent, the emissions from its chimneys guttering and dying. I see this city, this island, our most sacred of places, on fire.'<br/><br/>'There will be much slaughter and torment. A great flood, a terrible fire. A city will fall. A great battle where one of you will die. One race in civil war, another race swearing a terrible oath. The seas will run red with blood, the sky will turn black with smoke. It will be a time of great darkness, but also of great hope. There will be heroes, and victories. But one of you is not what he seems.' <br/><br/>'Do not awaken the sleeping goddess! She slumbers beneath the earth. If she were to awake, all would be lost. Let her be!'<br/><br/>And with that final exclamation Swiftstream collapsed to the ground, the spell broken. Arcane energies crackled through the air, as though something on the other side was trying to break out. It could be a chaos moth, an elemental backlash, or something much, much, worse. The four heroes stepped forward, working together to wrestle the magical energies back under control. With grim determination they were successful and the room was silent once more <b>[4]</b>.<br/><br/>******<br/><br/>[1] This whole section came about because the characters and world were pretty weird. So to help set the tone I asked every player to describe what their character had been doing when they got the summons, how they got to the island, and what their race's quarter of the partitioned city was like. <br/><br/>[2] I actually did this. The person whose house we were playing at had some kind of rock/mineral thing that we literally passed round during the scene. <br/><br/>[3] Using his prologue ability of Slams Down His Hammer and Calls for Order.  There was a lot of exposition to get through in this session, so most of the other prologue abilities didn't really get used until session two. <br/><br/>[4] This was a big mistake on my part. Having the chaos moth come through the barrier would have been a great way of ending the session and would have let the players show off how their new characters behave in a fight. Instead I framed some bullshit conflict about controlling the ritual with success stakes that ultimately boiled down to 'nothing happens'. That's a lesson I've tried to bear in mind since - 'roll to prevent cool shit from happening' is usually just bad play. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405802/#Comment_405802" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T14:12:58+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  2:12PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice recounting.

First Blood<br/>After Swiftstream recovered he spoke to the chosen ones. All four agreed to pursue the quest that had seemingly been laid out for them. They would collect the sacred keys of their peoples and investigate this strange island. <br/><br/>Now came the bad news. This was still a bureaucracy. Tomorrow there would be another committee meeting, with such items on the agenda as: what should this party of heroes be called? What will be their stated objectives? What will be their agreed code of conduct? Should there be a uniform? What is their diplomatic status, and what level of access will they have to each race's capital?<br/><br/>Further points of discussion had been added by the various ambassadors. The Phae Touched wanted to enforce a minimum number of good deeds on the way and include a ban on any further forest destruction. The Basites wanted to make Goldrock the leader of this party and give them all an instruction to kill all faeries on site (the fact that the ambiguity of the term faeries would also include the Phae Touched was surely a simple oversight). The Kasheetans wanted to add a statement condemning Ohmryn expansionism in the Strait of Muldrasa. And the Ohmryn wanted the heroes to travel in a party boat with a full entourage. <br/><br/>All this was to look forward to tomorrow. For today each hero still had other meetings and preparations to attend to. <br/><br/>Fleet returned to his office to find a vast queue of visitors. This was something he had gotten used to over the years. His assistant Leafthorn also provided him with a big pile of paperwork and complained about having to always stay late due to Fleet's many visitors. Fleet decided he had time to see three visitors but no more <b>[1]</b>. The first visitor was desperately ill, having contracted Dutch Elm disease due to his severe beetle infestation. Fleet was not able to heal him personally but recommended the services of Fieldshadow, a local healer/varnisher. The second visitor was Knick-Knack, a 'businessman' of dubious honesty who offered to cut Fleet into various get rich quick schemes. The third visitor was a concerned mother whose son had fallen in with a bad crowd and had been arrested for various misdemeanours; she asked Fleet to look into his case and see if there was anything he could do to help him out. Just as Leafthorn was about to send everyone away a fourth visitor stepped forward. It was Bethran Highhill, his old Wildren comrade. Bethran explained that he would very much like to meet the seer and see the standing stones before he died. Fleet passed this request on to Swiftstream who agreed to make this exception to protocol as a personal favour.<br/><br/>Sharl had a meeting with Ambassador Makrun and other political advisors. In the light of Sharl's recent 'indiscretion' with the Kasheetans, they had decided to give him some much-needed diversity training so as to avoid upsetting the other races any further. After a brief period of relaxation, including the smoking of a large amount of sea weed, various scenarios and strategies were explored. Sharl seemed thoroughly bored by the whole endeavour, but the politicians would not give up. Sharl left several hours later feeling none the wiser, only to bump into one of Sanctuary Island's guards - in this case, a Kasheetan. The guard seemed to recognise him and launched into a tirade of abuse, saying he had Kasheetan blood on his hands and was not fit to even step foot on Sanctuary Island. Sharl tried to remain cool but as soon as the Kasheetan started making threats and shoving him, he lost it. He went into a berserk shark fury and blacked out. <br/><br/>Zhel'darax was to greet the Sorcerer-Poet of Kratos Dai, the new Kasheetan apprentice to the seer of Sanctuary Island. They filtered smoke and then conducted a ritual of sacrifice <b>[2]</b>; the Sorcerer-Poet surprised Zhel-darax by asking him to take over this important ritual, but Zhel-darax proved more than up to this task and impressed his visitor with his insight. A poetry duel conducted afterwards only cemented this relationship. The Sorcerer-Poet has the ear of the Grand Matriarch so this was an important connection to have. During the period of meditation afterwards, however, Zhel'darax once again had his recurring dream. A younger-looking Grand Matriarch approaches a simple Kasheetan hut with two of her guards. Inside there is a female Kasheetan lying on the bed. The child she has just given birth to bears the sacred rune of fire as a birthmark. A Kasheetan man stands in the corner. The guards draw their weapons. And then the dream ends, as it always does, with no other clues as to what it's about.<br/><br/>Goldrock attended a guild meeting in the Basite temple in the east wing, where there was a small circle of standing stones. In union the Basites present performed the holy ritual of veneration and then announced the time of grudges, where Basites could present their grievances and seek restitution from one another. One of Goldrock's main customers, Stalag, complained that one of the  runehammers that had been sold to him had broken and must have been substandard. Goldrock's whole reputation as a craftsman was on the line, not to mention his pride. Stalag demanded a full apology and 17 free replacements! An attempt at negotiation failed so the matter was escalated to a full duel of honour before the sacred ancestor stones. At first it seemed that Goldrock was on the back foot, if only because he was holding back so as not to risk seriously injuring or killing one of his best customers. But then Stalag made a particularly cutting jibe about Goldrock's martial prowess and the gloves were off. Within seconds Stalag was lying on the floor with a sore head and Goldrock stood victorious. The pair shook hands and agreed to resume their working relationship in full. <br/><br/>Sharl woke up in the corridor. His knuckles were bloodied and bruised. The Kasheetan guard lay on the floor next to him, beaten to death. In panic, Sharl picked up the body and threw it into the nearest room. He could not remember the fight but did not want to be accused of a crime he may not have committed.<br/><br/>Fleet flew over to the sacred chamber to see how Swiftstream and Bethran were getting on. Along the way he passed a pair of Basite guards, but then when he went round the corner he passed another pair of Basite guards who looked just like them. He had the briefest feeling of deja vu and then carried on his way. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405859/#Comment_405859" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T12:03:01+00:00" title="February 10, 2013 12:03PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just then shouts were heard coming from the inner sanctum. The elderly Phae Touched who had carried the talking stone around during the council meeting came flying down the corridor raising the alarm. 'Help! Help! Swiftstream has been murdered!' she said. People started coming out of their rooms to see what all the fuss is about. All four heroes ran towards the chamber and opened the door. Inside they found a circle of magical energy crackling around the stones. Within the circle lay the bodies of both Swiftstream and Bethan; both had been stabbed multiple times. A chaos moth was in the process of emerging from the astral plane, attracted by the wild energies of Swiftstream's now-fizzled ritual of seeing; anyone inside the circle who was still alive would not stay so for long. <br/><br/>Fleet threw his javelin through at the chaotic creature but missed. Goldrock ran in but the giant moth unleashed a storm of electricity, trapping him in a cage of pure lightning and fusing the hinges of his nightsteel armour. Zhel'darax threw his bolas but the dread creature used its telekinesis to bat the weapon straight back at him. In the end it was Sharl who saved the day, barrelling towards the creature and running it though with his ancient relic spear Haon-Sri-Hu. <b>[3]</b><br/><br/>By this time there was a crowd outside. The heroes worked together again to take control of the fizzled ritual and drain away the wild magical energies that were surging through the room. On examination it was clear that Swiftstream was dead; he had been stabbed multiple times, and judging by the burn marks the assailant had used some kind of nightsteel weapon to do it. Bethran was gravely injured but still just about holding on. Zhel'darax tried to heal him with his Breath of Life but all that could be done was to make his last moments more comfortable. Fleet was beside himself with grief. <br/><br/>To try to shed more light on what had happened, Fleet used his power to Sift Through Memory and Borrow Senses to replay Bethran's memories. He saw two figures come into the room - a Basite and an Ohmryn. The Ohmryn was none other than the supposed hero Sharl! It seems Sharl had approached the seer, pulled out a nightsteel dagger, and leaped on him in a frenzy. The unknown Basite did the same thing to Bethan and then both assailants left. At this time Bethan began to drift away, and Fleet had to move quickly to avoid being left inside his mind at the terrifying moment of death itself. Bethan died. <b>[4]</b><br/><br/>Outside the Sorcerer-Poet and members of the guards were busy organising a full lock-down of the building in case the perpetrators had not already escaped. Goldrock joined the search. Soon enough the bodies of two Basite guards were found in a small closet, with a weird pile of skin flakes on the floor next to them. Skinchanger assassins! Those rare snakelike creatures can alter their appearance at will, and they are as deadly as they are fanatical. They could be anyone, or anywhere. From the success of their infiltration they must also have a set of keys. <br/><br/>The Sorcerer-Poet explained to the heroes that although skinchangers may well have been involved, they still had to investigate every lead no matter how unlikely. Some reports had also come in of Sharl being seen throwing a body into a deserted room, in which the body of a dead Kasheetan guard was subsequently found. This was clear evidence against Sharl so he and his quarters needed to be searched. Sharl refused, bristling with pride and fury at being suspected of such a crime <b>[5]</b>. The other heroes offered to be searched as well, and for their quarters to be examined, but this turned up no additional clues. Next stop: Sharl's quarters. <br/><br/>[1] Fleet's visitors were roleplayed by the other players (that's why there are three). I gave each player a one-sentence brief and let them improv the rest. It was quite a fun little diversion. <br/><br/>[2], [4], [5] Prologue abilities driving the fiction!<br/><br/>[3] This is the fight scene I should really have run in session one. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408042/#Comment_408042" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T15:48:55+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  3:48PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3. The Equinox<br/>The characters searched Sharl's room and, as anticipated, found two bloodied nightsteel daggers. Sharl denied having seen them before. Goldrock examined them and explained that although they are of Basite manufacture he could not tell precisely where they were made as the normal runes of craftsmanship had been left off. At this point the evidence against Sharl was clearly mounting and with the permission of Ambassador Makrun he was placed into custody. [1]<br/><br/>Zhel'darax used his powers of psychometry to determine how the daggers found their way into the sanctuary. He had a vision of a cloaked Kasheetan entering a bar - the Spotted Dogtopus in the Ohmryn quarter - and meeting with three Ohmryn. The Kasheetan handed the Ohmryn some daggers wrapped in a leather pouch, a set of keys, and three pass bracelets for the sanctuary. The three Ohmryn then disappeared into the shadows and emerged as Basites before making their way towards the sanctuary compound. The Kasheetan fled. <br/><br/>So there was a third assassin and the plot may have had a man on the inside (a Kasheetan?). The heroes spoke to the Sorcerer-Poet of Kratos Dai and the other two apprentice seers, Galdr of the Ohmryn and Baldurr of the Basites, but not before Goldrock surreptitiously examined them to make sure they were  not really skinchangers.  A check of the inventory revealed that one of the Ohmryn's sets of keys for the building were missing - presumably the ones used by the assassins. Was this proof of Ohmryn complicity or merely their incompetence?<br/><br/>Either way, as skinchanger assassins can only maintain their form for so long, and the whole building was in lockdown, they agreed to assemble everyone in the main voting chamber. Between the Basites' ability to see through illusion and the pressure of everyone being all together at once, any remaining assassins were sure to be revealed. Due to concerns over Sharl's safety it was agreed that he would be released from his cell under armed guard, his manacles removed as a gesture of diplomatic courtesy for such a public arena.  <br/><br/>As the room began to fill up, Fleet's clerk Leafthorn darted into the chamber holding a message scroll. Heading straight for the Sorcerer-Poet, he pulled out a nightsteel dagger coated in orange poison. Zhel-darax saw this and responded immediately, hurling his firestone bolas at the would-be assassin and knocking him to the ground. The Sorcerer-Poet himself, seemingly taken by surprise, lifted his firestone staff to finish the job. Fleet, wanting a live prisoner to interrogate, shouted across the room to intervene but was too late - a white hot beam of pure energy burned a channel through the skinchanger's head and ten feet into the stone floor. The assassin was dead! The Sorcerer-Poet thanked Fleet and Zhel'darax for their assistance and then moved on to the next item on the agenda - determining who would succeed Swiftstream as the next seer. <br/><br/>This was a contest between the three apprentices - the Sorcerer-Poet, Galdr, and Baldurr. There would be no candidate for the Phae-Touched as they had been the last ones to hold the position, although a new apprentice would be sent over from the Wychlight Forest as soon as the vote was decided. Each race had one vote. Out of embarrassment due to Sharl's alleged crimes and their own apparent loss of the keys, the Ohmryn abstained. With no candidate of their own, the Phae Touched also abstained. The Basites and the Kasheetans both then voted for the Sorcerer-Poet to formally become the new seer of Sanctuary Island. <br/><br/>The characters now went to investigate Fleet's office to see if they could find the real Leafthorn. Which they did, snapped in two and stuffed into a cupboard. The body was still warm so it was clear that this had happened after Sharl had been arrested. This along with the evidence of the seeing stone was enough to prove that Sharl could not have been the murderer and so he was exonerated of those crimes. The matter of the dead Kasheetan he had woken up next to was less clear - possibly this murder was committed by the same person who had planted the daggers in his quarters, but it could not be proven - but was simply glossed over in the interests of diplomacy. However, Sharl would still find that the shadow of these allegations hanging over him in any future dealings with the Kasheetans. <br/><br/>Now that everyone in the building had been cleared of being a skinchanger, the lockdown was removed. The Sorcerer-Poet gave the group permission to carry on with their quest immediately, promising to resolve all the bureaucratic issues on their behalf. It also emerged that Swiftstream had left them something of a legacy - being a fervent believer in the ancient prophecies, he had commissioned the creation of a medium sized boat to take the group on their quest. This boat was named the Equinox, and came equipped with wind spirits bound to the sails, and broadside cannons loaded with nightsteel ammunition [2]. At its prow was a figurehead of the four races together holding up the sun, a symbol of unity intended to have an inspirational effect on all concerned. It was also agreed that the ship would be crewed by 16 members of the sanctuary guard, ensuring an even split between the four races and reducing the risk of inter-species conflict.<br/><br/>Later a messenger relayed the news that two skinchangers had been found and killed in the Ohmryn quarters while trying to get a boat off the island. The immediate problem had been resolved. However, it was still clear that security needed to be beefed up. As the Basites can see through illusions, their guards would be allowed to stay on. And as the Sorcerer-Poet could personally vouch for all the Kasheetans, they too could stay on. However, the Ohmryn and Phae Touched guards would have to be temporarily suspended until their background checks could be fully completed, just to make sure there were no more incidents. <br/><br/>After a brief fanfare the Equinox and her crew left for the first leg of their journey.  As the rocky cliffs of the Kasheetan Empire came into view, the crew found themselves mesmerised by a strange and beautiful song drifting over the wind. Fleet recognised this straight away as the call of the Siren, an aquatic form of Unseelie that tries to lure unwitting sailors to their doom. As he looked more closely he noticed two such creatures in the waters ahead of the ship, darting gleefully between the waves and drawing them towards some very sharp looking rocks.  Fleet began a powerful countersong in an attempt to protect himself as much as the crew - in the past he has felt vulnerable to the call of the Unseelie, and if he was not careful he could easily find himself reinforcing the Sirens call rather than opposing it. Due to this internal conflict he was only partially successful - some of the crew were broken out of their trance, but not all, and this risked spilling over into a fight between the two camps. Taking advantage of the time Fleet had bought them, Goldrock summoned a brief but terrible lightning storm straight ahead to smash the Sirens into submission.  Sure enough two burnt and broken mermaid-like bodies floated up to the surface, still hissing in the boiling water, and the ship was able to continue safely on its way. <br/><br/>[1] Sharl's player wasn't present at the session so this was quite a convenient way of writing him out of the action for a while. <br/><br/>[2] The Equinox came about entirely from the imaginations of the players. I had no involvement. They had the idea that such a ship might have been built and then used spotlight points to stat it up and buy relationships to it. One player also drew a picture of it afterwards. Giving players creative input into the game really works. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
