What happens if you both roll the same initial sum?</blockquote>\nAn attacking 1 is removed from play after the attack. If both players initially roll the same amount the player using the lighter colored dice goes first (like white going first in Chess). I also updated this in the PDF.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Guy Srinivasan</cite>It looks to me like any initial difference in rolls of more than 3 pips if both rolls are high gives player 2 a pretty strong advantage, and if 1s are removed upon demotion, the higher roll nearly always wins if both rolls are low.</blockquote>\nI'm hoping to figure some of this out with more play.

I just included the rule to make it possible for a player with more dice to compete against a player with one higher value die. I hadn't considered what would happen in the case of a tie situation. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: balthazar</cite>2) You're only allowed to re-roll if you don't have a single die that can take out any of your opponent's dice. Can you still do a re-roll even if a ganging up attack is possible?</blockquote>\nYou can re-roll any die at any time. The disadvantage in doing so is forfeiting your attack that round and the risk is rolling the same or a lower number. I need to make that clear in the rules. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: balthazar</cite>When you have a tie, you need to bring in two external dice to do the roll-off. That's a little sloppy.

I like your solution much better. I'd like to play it a few times and see how it works. <br/><br/>This complicates your first point though (ganging up to make a tie). It would certainly give an advantage to the person ganging up. It also brings the issue of whether you would lower the winning die (or not) after rolling to break the tie. I don't think it would be necessary but it might make sense to remain consistent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273539/#Comment_273539" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T21:07:57+00:00" title="May 28, 2010  9:07PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is hella fucking slick.<br/>I love little dice games.

I keep meaning to change that officially.<br/><br/>I like the changes, although I think that taking out the Ganging Up does eliminate a whole bunch of strategy. I'd have to play the game a bit to be sure.<br/><br/>Reading over the rules this time, I noticed something that might have been present before. By the letter of the rules, you're allowed to launch a losing attack, and I think it might sometimes be to your benefit.<br/><br/>For example, suppose that I have a 5 and a 1, and you have a 6. It's my turn. I can attack your 6 with my 1. The 1 is removed, but your 6 gets reduced to a 5, since it's the winning die. This gives me a 50% chance of winning the game, whereas if I chose to reroll the 1 instead the best I could do is get a 6, which still doesn't guarantee me a win. It might not come up that often, but it's valid.<br/><br/>In order to do this, though, you have to read the second paragraph of your "re-roll" section as advice, rather than a rule. I'm not sure if you want to make that explicit or not.<br/><br/>By the way, if you've ever played "Button Men" from Cheapass Games, it resembles this a lot. But Button Men is more complex - you use different polyhedral dice, there are special attacks, and there's definitely a ganging-up mechanism, though I don't remember the specifics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274574/#Comment_274574" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T13:30:21+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  1:30PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2010 1:52PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems like a pretty cool game!<br/><br/>I'm curious why you made the decision to remove Ganging Up? Was it just for reasons of simplicity? It seems like it would work fine, as long as you don't allow "Ganging Up" to be a "Fair Fight" at the same time...<br/><br/>EDIT: Or, if you do want to allow Ganging Up in a Fair Fight situation, wouldn't it work to have each side reroll one of their dice (but not both)? That gives an interesting incentive (potentially) to Gang Up with higher dice than needed (for instance, two 5s Ganging Up on a single 6 have a better chance of success than two 4s).<br/><br/>(You'd probably need to specify that the Ganging Up group needs to reroll the higher of the two dice, for balance. But I'm not 100% sure on that one, though I like it a lot as a variation--adds some unpredictable events to play without being an obvious choice one way or another.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274580/#Comment_274580" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T13:51:55+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  1:51PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2010 2:25PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just "solo playtested" the version I suggested above, and it seems like fun.<br/><br/>My variation is to add a simple "map": one "home zone" for each army/team, and two "no man's lands" in the middle, so you can pass through either one in order to get to the opponent's home zone--like a 2 x 2 square, with no diagonal movement. All your dice start in your home zone. You lose the game if your home zone is occupied by enemy dice (and none of your own) for two turns in a row.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can: <br/><br/>* Reroll a die<br/>* Attack an enemy's die (via Attack, Fair Fight, or Ganging Up). You may use dice already in the enemy's zone, or move the attacking dice into an adjacent zone as part of the Attack.<br/>* Move any number of dice from one zone to an adjacent zone, but only if there are no enemy dice there.<br/><br/>My version's not all that playtested just yet! Just brainstorming.

So, using the second version of the rules:<br/><br/>On your turn, you can Feint/Step Back or Attack.<br/><br/>* If you Feint or Step Back, say how and reroll one die of your choice.<br/>* If you Attack, push forward one die. Any die that is smaller than all your opponent's dice cannot be used to attack.<br/><br/>The defender then must decide to Take the Blow, Block, or Challenge.<br/><br/>* To Block, the defender discards one die that is one pip smaller than the attacking die. The attacking die loses one pip.<br/>* To Take the Blow, the defender discards one die that is smaller than the attacking die by two or more. The difference between the two dice becomes damage to the defender; the attacking die loses one pip.<br/>* To Challenge, the defender pushes forward one die of equal size. Reroll both dice; the smaller of the two is discarded.<br/><br/>At the end, the winner's remaining dice are also damage to the loser, if desired.<br/><br/>That's Risus combat for you, Dogs-style. I think it could be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
