The premise (in brief): It is three generations after the Deluge, a great flood that washed away a life-threatening poison. Our technology is essentially dead (with some limited exceptions) and monsters and magic have stepped out of the rain. Ever since the Deluge, there has been the rain; non-stop, sometimes thundering hard, sometimes barely a mist. Not terribly original, perhaps, but I'm going for a game in which the cities of today are the ruins explored by expeditions in a fantasy game.<br/><br/>RAIN uses tarot cards for both its mechanic and the character ... "interface." By that I mean that players use cards laid out in front of them for their character sheet, the environment and the NPCs are also represented by the tarot. <br/><br/>I've written a <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxjb3VydG9mbWlkbmlnaHR8Z3g6NDEyM2ZmMmU3ZjY5MDgwNA" rel="nofollow">book for the players</a> and a <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxjb3VydG9mbWlkbmlnaHR8Z3g6MTdiNGY1Zjg1YTk0NjZjZA" rel="nofollow">book for the GM</a>. Both are about 30 pages long (font 12, no columns). <br/><br/>I would love to get some feedback from my fellow Story-gamers. I've put a lot of effort into making the mechanic engaging and driven by the narrative. There is a lot still in my head, so questions about setting and clarity are EXACTLY what I'm looking for. <br/><br/>I'm also looking for artists. Ahh, better clarify: I'm looking for VOLUNTEER artists. This is a labor of love for me and I am hoping to start promoting the game (once it is complete) as much as I can - for free. I don't want to make money off it, I just want to share what I think is a really good idea. I am not an artist, though, and I'm looking for some talented folks to help me out. <br/><br/>For comments on the game, please reply to this thread so everyone can see your thoughts and not repeat them. If you are interested in helping with art (and bless you), please send me a whisper or a message. <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421214/#Comment_421214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-08T10:32:00+00:00" title="September  8, 2013 10:32AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2013 10:47AM by AllanDotson.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good looking game.  You've got a lot of cool imagery around the rain and lush, overgrown ruins.  It might be cool to create a custom Tarot deck for the game, incorporating the visuals of your setting into the cards.  Those illustrations could be part of the book, but they could also be printed off separately as a deck for players to use.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421220/#Comment_421220" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-08T17:15:06+00:00" title="September  8, 2013  5:15PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you! I think you're right both about a custom tarot deck and using the illustrations for the books. That's a pretty ambitious project, though. I can see having a few cards done at a time, enough initially to put the books in good shape, then developing the rest of the deck as time and talent allows. <br/><br/>I'm very glad you like the imagery. Any comment on the mechanics? While I would be glad to hear whether you liked them or not, I'm especially interested in clarity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421243/#Comment_421243" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T08:26:18+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  8:26AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found the rules clear.  My initial reaction to the Set-Up move was that it was too complicated.  Do you need to draw a card for this?  What if you just traded a minor complication for -1 to the threat?  The more I think about it, I like it as is.  It does mean you could potentially have a lot of card draws for each action (set-ups, challenge draw, redraws), but since the players have to narrate each draw, that could be just fine, and make for a lot of description on each action.<br/><br/>The one thing I'm unclear on is spells.  Do you draw for them just like you would for skills?  An example of play using spells would help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421310/#Comment_421310" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-10T04:01:05+00:00" title="September 10, 2013  4:01AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see your confusion regarding how spells are cast. There are two kinds of spells: the specific ones granted by Strengths and the free-form magic accessed by the Skill Sets.<br/><br/>The spells from Strengths are cast simply by flipping that Strength; there is no card draw. The free-form magic works just like any other skill (mechanically). You narrate the magic and can either flip the Skill Set to reduce the Threat or challenge a card and draw. <br/><br/>I have been test-playing the rules quite a bit, but that has resulted in a lot of rule changes because I have a tendency to tinker when given the slightest excuse. I'm not allowing myself to do that as quickly now, but I'm not going to start test-playing these rules until the end of this month. I wonder if requiring a card-flip for Set-Ups is too much, especially given that there is already the chance of consequences.<br/><br/>And, yes, the fact that every use of the mechanic requires narration or description means that a lot of mechanic equals a lot of story. And since the mechanic is either a simple flip of the card or a single draw from the deck, I think it's a good balance.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feed-back. I'll put in an example of the two kinds of magic. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423276/#Comment_423276" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-22T04:36:22+00:00" title="October 22, 2013  4:36AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've started test playing the system and so far it's going really well! You can read about it <a href="http://courtofmidnight.blogspot.com/2013/10/its-raining-again.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you like. <br/><br/>One element of the game mechanic that is working very well is the consequence system. The game uses Tarot Cards for just about everything. When a player wants to do something dramatic, they draw a card from their constructed deck. If that card is inverted, or if they fail to resist an action from someone acting against them, they get 1 to 4 consequence markers (the one thing for which the cards AREN'T used). <br/><br/>In these first few sessions, my players have really latched on to those markers and what they represent. So, one player had his backpack destroyed in a scuffle with goblins (consequence), then another player took it with the promise to replace it. He still doesn't have it back yet, so he's kept that consequence marker. Since he lost his backpack, he has gotten into an argument with a merchant because she was making fun of his name (two consequences), and got into a fight with dead dogs (two or three consequences). Most of those other consequences he has recovered from - but he still doesn't have his backpack so he's hanging on to that marker!<br/><br/>And that has kind of been a thing: when they play through a recovery scene (an idea I got from John Harper's Lady Blackbird), they are very choosey about which consequences they feel they have recovered from and which are still too fresh or heavy, whether a physical wound or a point of embarrassment. I don't know why I didn't see this coming - it's pretty much written into the game without being explicitly so - but it's great to see.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424026/#Comment_424026" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T13:01:01+00:00" title="November 10, 2013  1:01PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another player has joined the game and I wanted to put the character creation to the test - instead of sitting down with him before we played, we made his character as we played the game - he made decisions as things came up and without much help from me. You can read about it <a href="http://courtofmidnight.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>It worked pretty well. He did need to decide upon his Nature before he was able to play. As part of that, he also ended up choosing his Identity, which seemed to flow pretty naturally - looked like he had no problem choosing how people saw his character or what social class he belonged to. <br/><br/>I asked him one question about his strength - it seemed like "Strong" should be a strength for a blacksmith. It looked like he was very easily able to put the rest of the character (skills, realm, and a second strength) without much issue while playing the character.  <br/><br/>The group role-played really well together. We have two players who have never role-played before and it seems they are having a lot fun and getting into the characters nicely. <br/><br/>A side note, I'm moving this thread to "actual play" since that is the direction it is taking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
