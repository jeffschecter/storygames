She's got her favorites among those I've riffed, but sometimes coming up with a new hook to spin and Abby story is hard.  So I whipped up this oracle, with some characters we've met before, and some new ones included.  I haven't played it with Ads yet, but I'm going to do it with her tonight and see how she takes to the whole thing.  Half the time, she's making suggestions as I tell the story anyhow, and sometimes she pretends to be Abby and does Abby's voice, and sometimes I do Jaja the blue horse's voice.  <br/><br/>There's not much game in it right now, but she's not yet three... I think adding some more game gradually as we go along is going to be really fun.<br/><br/>-B                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165003/#Comment_165003" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T13:58:24+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  1:58PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool.

I might have to turn this into a 4d20 oracle because the dice were such a hit.<br/><br/>Abby had lots of things around the house that needed fixing, and got really tired and went to sit in her garden on a rock... which started to talk.  She made friends with Charlie the Talking Rock, and he mentioned a monster had just moved into a cave across the lake.  Abby decided to go be neighborly, so she packed up her favorite suitcase (with the secret compartments) with bread, and cake, and scones ("and blueberries!") and five <i>perfect </i>raspberries which she put into a hidden place in the suitcase.  So she walks along the windy trail around the lake, and to the monster's cave, and they have an echoed conversation until the monster comes out, all huge and harry, and complains about people always being afraid of him because he's so big and loud, and Abby said she wasn't afraid, and brought bread and scones and cake and blueberries, and five <i>perfect </i>raspberries.   The monster was so touched, he and Addy shared the <i>perfect </i>raspberries (giving one to a very lucky passing bird), and he offered to help Abby with any work around her house, and she mentioned her goopy gunky gutters needed cleaning out.  Joy!  The monster <i>loves </i>gutter-gunk!  So they tromp back along the windy trail around the lake to Abby's house, and the big monster (who needed no ladder), scraped his big finger down the gutter like he was scooping frosting off a cake, and he ate it up with a smile.  Abby, Charlie, and their new monster friend sat in her garden, and talked about all kinds of things for the rest of the afternoon. <br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
