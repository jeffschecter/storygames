And while it's not (usually) outright <i>killing</i> the fun, it's definitely impeding it. I can totally see how I'm contributing to the problem, too! I'm totally giving marching orders and providing plans and stuff. I just don't know how to break out of the loop. I'll try to explain with an example:<br/><br/>Setting: a fictional island dictatorship full of conspiracies and psychics and crazies. One PC, Frank, was taken in for questioning at Peace Force HQ, because he checked in to the State hospital with bullet wounds from UN Peacekeeper weapons and the cops put 2 and 2 together and figured he had something to do with the UN facility that was blown up the other night. In fact, he WAS there with his pal Delcus, trying to warn the base personnel about the other PCs who did infiltrate and blow the place up. Only they "warned" them rather belligerently, and got thrown in the brig then later Frank was shot as they escaped.<br/><br/>So he's in custody, and the cops are trying to soften him up and get him to spill before they hand him over to the UN guys, who won't ask so. . .<i>nicely</i>. Meanwhile, Delcus tries to get in to see him, but the Peace won't let him in, so he returns to Frank's apartment to weigh his options. Now, so far, the players got here through their own choices. . .they found out about the UN raid through player interaction, decided what to do about it, decided to go to the Govt. hospital even knowing the risk (getting shot is practically a confession on this island that you were interfering with state business), decided what to do about the arrest. But at this point, the players seem to be out of ideas. Frank's player is just going with a belligerent "hey, I'm innocent, you got nothing on me" stance, and not giving any info on thew real infiltrators, and Del's player is just, "eh, couldn't get in to help him, I'll just check on him in the morning." As it stands, Frank's gonna get tortured for information, then summarily executed. Delcus will poke around and maaaybe find out where they dumped the body, but will never see his friend alive again. The end.<br/><br/>Soooo, I stepped in. Suddenly the setting is crawling with helpful NPCs suggesting courses of action to save poor Frank's ass. When Del arrives at Frank's apt Aleksandr, apprentice to the sorceror Frank had dealings with, is waiting, seeking Frank on his master's behalf, and suggests a plan to get in to save him. Another PC, James is contacted by the organization he works for and told that his friend Frank has been arrested and helpfully contacts an inside man on the Peace Force to help James infiltrate HQ. And when the UN interrogators come in, Frank does spill the beans on the infiltrator PC, but then sits in relative silence as I have the two interrogators argue about whether the information is legit (one of them KNOWS it's legit, because <i>he</i> tipped off the PC about the facility, and is trying to distract from that avenue of investigation). And everyone's "playing their character," and seems to be having a good time more or less, but it strikes me when I'm about two-thirds deep into it that nobody's really <i>doing</i> much of anything except me, as I furiously spin and weave this elaborate web of situation.<br/><br/>The causes of this dynamic aren't exactly mysterious:\n<ul><li>I know all kinds of crap about the setting that nobody else does (OTE is a book crammed THICK with weird and wild setting bits), and the game really hinges around discovering that setting, therefore I often end up doing a lot of exposition, introducing characters and locations, highlighting little vignettes and snapshots of what the city is like.</li><li>I tend to try to support the PCs' character concepts by having those around them treat them like important people--hey, MR thief, can you steal this for me, hey Mr Assassin, can you take somebody out?--but this leads to a lot of NPCs doing a lot of the talking and planning.</li><li>When PCs are in a fix, I've often had NPCs come to their aid, to avoid senseless PC death and such, so now it's a habit. The aid is generally pretty plausible in terms of PCs' contacts and relationship, but still.</li></ul>\nWhat I <i>don't</i> know is how to break out of it. It seems like we're stuck in a rut; the players are low on solutions to problems or initiative to solve them, probably because I keep doing it for them, but if I stop doing it for them, they're screwed, so I keep supplying the plans. . .I totally <i>don't</i> wanna be that "Come and listen to my cool GM story and roll some dice occasionally" guy, but at these sessions I'm just <i>talking</i> so damn much. Even when I try to draw the players in, solicit or wait for their input, it still ends up defaulting back to me. Like, when the cops turned Frank over to the UN guys, there was some cool tension because Frank DID spill the beans about Ai'li, the infiltrator PC, and one of the interrogators tried to discredit Frank's claim, because unbeknownst to the other guy, <i>he</i> was the one who leaked Ai'li the info on the facility. Ai'li's player even pointed that out, confused, and I said "yeah, but THIS guy doesn't know that!" and she wen't "O-oh," and suddenly everyone was interested in this little exchange. People started to go, "Hey, maybe Frank could figure out that this guy's lying," but Frank's player was like, "uh, no, he's not <i>psychic</i>." I suggested that he roll his "Keen insight into Homo Sapiens" trait to figure out that he's hiding something," but the player insisted that that trait was <i>only</i> for discerning what bugs a person so he can get under their skin, not for any kind of lie detecting or motive sensing application (which isn't the way OTE traits are supposed to work, but hey). And so boom, it's kicked back to me, as I proceed to talk to myself for 10-15 minutes as the two interrogators argue. Bleh.<br/><br/>The whole game doesn't necessarily proceed this way; a couple of players are pretty consistent with driving the action forward proactively with their characters. And most of the players have <i>some</i> initiative; they'll at least know what their characters want, and pursue that. But there's this sort of uneven lurching start-stop pace to play as they take decisive action toward <i>whatever</i>, then don't know what to do when they get there, so their momentum grinds to a halt and I end up taking over, until finally they get to a point where they know what they want to do it, until the next time they draw a blank, so I step in. . .it's kinda frustrating and wearing.<br/><br/>Can anyone relate? Any advice and ideas are welcome, or just personal impressions and such. One thing to note, though: we're actually working on bringing the game to a close--not with any kind of deadline, just a general directive to move toward completion and closure of individual characters' storylines. This makes hangups in the pacing even more frustrating, and also means that any solutions have to work within the timeframe of oh, 6-10 sessions.

It seems like you want to remain faithful to that, but at the same time run it in sort of a Sim way, i.e. the Peace Force would torture and murder the PC and that's the only plausible option. <br/><br/>This seems to be a pattern -- you also say that the PC's aren't able to figure out what's going on so you help them with NPC's, because otherwise they'd be screwed.  <br/><br/>I mean, it seems like you're playing tennis on both sides of the net here, which leads to you working way too hard and the players getting disengaged and confused.  The scene where you feel obliged to dramatize an arguement between NPC's because the PC in the scene won't bite any of the hooks you offer is probably the ultimate example of this.  <br/><br/> That's the key dysfunction from what you wrote; there are probably many ways to respond to it.  <br/><br/>Here's one way that's worked for me as GM:<br/> <br/>If you have a wheels-within-wheels plot that the players can't keep up with and which is not working very well, why not jettison it and go with something much simpler?  You know, like come up with a film noir sort of backstory that's consistent with what's gone before but helps both you and them make sense of what is to come.  Let the plot move forward, getting more and more obvious as time goes on, until the PC's figure it out and start engaging it.  <br/><br/>Another gimmick from film noir: reveal at some point that one of the NPCs has been using the PC's as catspaws all along, and that's why they keep getting manipulated, assisted, and rescued from all angles -- this guy is trying to get them into position to make his enemy vulnerable, or to make them act as fall guys.  If the players are feeling confused and paranoid, it might be good for them to figure out who's been screwing with their heads this whole time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125670/#Comment_125670" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T23:40:13+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 11:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>Can anyone relate? Any advice and ideas are welcome, or just personal impressions and such.</blockquote>\nI can relate.<br/><br/>Here's some things that we did in our With Great Power game to basically focus it on the PCs, with the adventure moving with them (it's in line with Danny's observation above). Not sure how much of this you can do now that the campaign is winding down though. But the steps below were directly responsible for the players running the game with me as a facilitator (and yeah, having some "world secrets" to reveal, some of which changed as the PCs invented new shit):<br/><br/>1) Create a stable of NPCs that the players regularly interact with. I did this all myself as the GM, setting up the world so that we didn't have to have a totally hippie "lets make all characters together" session. Still, I left it open for if the players were aiming to create a new NPC or two. Didn't happen, though, we just used my stable of about a dozen characters: 4 "baddies" (who weren't out to directly kill the NPCs, they could have meals with them and stuff; they just weren't friendlies), 6 "coworkers/friends", and about 1-2 characters per PC which were personally attached to them: Best Friend, Fiancee, and Ex-girlfriend.<br/><br/>2) The important part: Make the players take on the roles of the NPCs.  Tell them like two things about that character, make them take the role, and let them go nuts. If you have a scene with one PC and one NPC, hand the NPC over to another player. Let them go at it. Maybe tell the player the NPC's motivation and maybe 1-2 things about them so they can "take on the role", but let them go at it.  If you have a "GM secret", only step in and "take back control" or "guide the conversation" when the player-run NPC starts to move into that territory: "Great job, Rick, I'll take it from here".  But for the most part you let them take on the roles on NPCs.<br/><br/>In the above, one the players take on responsibilities that lay on "both sides of the screen", you'll see them become more like GMs themselves, authoring their own, and others', stories.<br/><br/>I can't theoretically explain the solid connection between <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and how it directly led to the players calling their own shots, developing their own storylines, and most importantly doing it themselves without waiting for the GM to force them. But that's Exactly what happened. It worked. More than the backbone rules of With Great Power, those above two bits of WGP game advice really drove the players into carving their own stories with the material provided.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125671/#Comment_125671" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T01:04:38+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  1:04AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like you are presenting the players with problems that they don't know how to solve. Like that situation that woulda/shoula/coulda ended with Frank as a corpse. Maybe what you need are situations that become interesting no matter what players decide to do. Or perhaps they need to be more important? If all they do is investigate stuff they don't already have a seriously vested interest in, it easily starts to feel like you have your own GM story, and they are wandering into it and don't know what to do.<br/><br/>Or try to base adventures on what they find interesting. If they latch onto some clue, spin it out into a whole crazy adventure. Have NPCs ask the PCs for their theories and opinions, then use those answers - either make them true, or pull out the interesting bits.<br/><br/>I totally know how you feel, though.

And given that, I can't say I'm surprised to hear that your group tends to flounder when called upon to make useful plans for what to do next, and even when simply deciding what (if anything) they ought to do next.  They probably feel like they only understand enough about the setting to know that they don't understand nearly enough about it, and so you're probably right to feel like doing a lot of exposition might be doing more harm than good.  You're trying to throw a lot of light onto the setting, but because so much of it is unrecognizable, all it's doing is making bigger and scarier shadows.<br/><br/>(Seriously, I love Al Amarja, but...holy kickboxing jesus, I don't know that I'd want to run a game set in it.  Certainly not for a group of people who aren't already familiar with it and with the mind-boggling assortment of source material it's swiped from.)<br/><br/>So the suggestion to simplify sounds like a good one to me.  Pick out one or two bits of the weirdness that you think really click with you and with the group, and then "normalize" the rest so that A.) you don't have to spend time on exposition to familiarize everyone with it, and B.) everyone can feel like their normal everyday knowledge of human motivations/society/technology/whatever is applicable in this game.  Trim the story's complexity down -- fewer NPCs, simpler plots, more straightforward agendas -- until you hit the sweet spot where there's enough material to keep the players engaged without there being so much that it buries them.<br/><br/>Of course, that'd be a lot easier if you were, say, two sessions in...but since you're actually 6-10 sessions from the end, the time when you could have reasonably simplified the setting without anyone noticing is probably long past.  But you still have time to cut out anything that you haven't already shoved at the players and come up with something cleaner and more straightforward.  And maybe instead of doing exposition and having NPCs jump into the mix, you can fall back on asking the players how <i>they</i> think something works (like what the cops are going to do with a re-captured prisoner) and reassure them that you will be their "common sense" and jump in if they're making an incorrect assumption -- although, again, this late in the game they may have already decided that they just don't know enough to even guess at how things work and will be totally gunshy about suggesting anything.<br/><br/>Oh, and as always, this is exactly the kind of thing you should sit down and discuss with your group.  Asking people on the internet is fun and sometimes interesting, but it's nothing compared the results you get when you actually address your concerns with the people who share them.  Probably you've already mentioned it to them, but if you haven't (or if you just haven't gone into the same kind of detail you have here), that really should be your next step: any ideas you and your group think up to make your game better will automatically be fifteen trillion times better than the best idea you'll read here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125996/#Comment_125996" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T12:32:33+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 12:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the responses, guys!<br/><br/>A general remark: yes, i have talked about this stuff with the group; I think it's a had mixed success. Lots of head-nodding, "oh yeah, that's a problem, we agree, let's not do that," kind of response, then very little actual modification of behavior. I absolutely believe that communication is vital, but on some level I just have to accept that I'm not going <i>discuss</i> my players into playing a certain way.<br/><br/>So right now i'm focusing more on modifying  my <i>own</i> behavior.<br/><br/>Now, some specific comments:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>It seems like you want to remain faithful to that, but at the same time run it in sort of a Sim way, i.e. the Peace Force would torture and murder the PC and that's the only plausible option.<br/></blockquote>\nI just wanted to point out that it looks like the only option <i>under a highly specific set of circumstances</i>. Like, the severity of the incident and the events leading up to the arrest and questioning just can't end with a slap on the wrist without straining credibility. Also, I should add that my personal tendency has been toward leniency, and it's the players who're really reinforcing the expectation that Frank's screwed. I don't think my usual M.O. of "The cops come sniffing around, lean on the PCs a bit but don't really do much" would be satisfying for anyone. I don't think it's all that "Sim" to avoid an "Aww, c'm<i>on</i>!" outcome. This is all just a bit of a quibble, I suppose, but I wanted to clarify.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite><br/>If you have a wheels-within-wheels plot that the players can't keep up with and which is not working very well, why not jettison it and go with something much simpler?  You know, like come up with a film noir sort of backstory that's consistent with what's gone before but helps both you and them make sense of what is to come.</blockquote>\nI'm not really certain how you mean I should do this--have a talk with everybody about handwaving a lot of the setting detail away and making it more vague? I don't think that would really "take," and it's definitely too late in the campaign for a paradigm shift. the level of detail is, for better or worse, set where it's at--dial it down and you'd undercut a lot of leverage for effectiveness that the players DO depend on using.<br/><br/>Your catspaw idea is excellent and quite compatible, though. I don't think there would be any strain on expectations to reveal secret, hidden motives. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Andy: great idea, wish i'd thought of that years ago for this campaign, might be a little late to start fiddling with it now, though.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>It sounds like you are presenting the players with problems that they don't know how to solve. Like that situation that woulda/shoula/coulda ended with Frank as a corpse. Maybe what you need are situations that become interesting no matter what players decide to do. Or perhaps they need to be more important? If all they do is investigate stuff they don't already have a seriously vested interest in, it easily starts to feel like you have your own GM story, and they are wandering into it and don't know what to do.</blockquote>\nYeah, one problem, I think, is that when i set out on this whole endeavor, I had very little idea of what the point or purpose wof anything would be. And while it's useful to be fluid with expectations and not overplan, when your whole ambition is "I'm gonna reveal [X big conspiracy or weird thing] and it's gonna be so <i>cool</i>!" things become especially aimless; the conspiracies aren't really striving to <i>do</i> anything (here, now, un-ignorable by the PCs), so when they're uncovered it's kind of like, "uh, OK? So what?" it's like a Dogs town without the "what will happen if the PCs don't intervene" section filled out. When we discussed this recently one player confessed that now that the big global, millennia-old conspiracy that was behind his character's "kicker" was revealed, it just seemed too 'big" for him, like OK, these guys control the world, whatchagunnado, eh?" I think if the conspiracy were going to DO something, right now, that he couldn't ignore, he'd be able to fly into action to stop it.<br/><br/>So yeah, it's not so much (anymore) that they're pursuing stuff unrelated to the characters, it's just that there's a vital component missing for compelling story-driving action. I think I've identified that component now, so that should help things immensely in the limited time remaining.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>All that setting? The conspiracies? They're details of the playtest campaign. And you're 'supposed' (though the text doesn't cover it) to make up your own. It's not a bible to adhere to, it's examples to follow.</blockquote>\nHoly shit, Joe, no <i>KIDDING</i>. I heard that fairly recently too, and I wish that'd occurred to me years earliewr. A lot of my problem with running this game was being an Al Amarja fanboy from the card game and wanting to "present" all the <i>superkewl</i> setting stuff to everybody so they could move it as much as me.

Overprotectiveness isn't going to help your players from taking bad choices, not taking the initiative and not even bothering on thinking what to do next. They need to learn that their choices have consequences (even choosing not to do anything at all), instead of letting the GM lead the way once they run out of ideas.<br/><br/>As a GM wanting to tell a story, that will be frustrating. But think on how frustrating it already is for you. Do you really want to keep saving their asses over and over again?<br/><br/>Of course, this is not the only thing you could (or should) do, but it relates to part of the problem. You have tried talking with them, it didn't work... But think of them as teenagers. Since when do teenagers really act differently by just talking to them? You have to make them realize they are doing wrong, and face the consequences to their actions.<br/><br/>Else, they will remain the same no matter what you do, how much you make them relate to the story and characters, how easy the problems get, how cool and detailed the setting is...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126058/#Comment_126058" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T15:27:34+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  3:27PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you have to consider the possibility that the reason they're not engaging with the situation is that they really don't care about it.

I remember this one D&amp;D game where I set up an adventure which involved escorting a diplomat through miles of forests filled with hostile tribes.  The problem?  The diplomat had far better social skills than anyone in the party.  Every time they met some hostiles, they'd sick the diplomat on them, to talk their way out.

Now I'll answer this specific question:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Endgame is 6 to 10 sessions long? How long have you guys been playing for? And was the proactiveness level of the players greater or lower at the beginning than it is now?</blockquote>\nWe've been playing for. . .lemme see, 'bout 8 years. Though really it's more like half that since I rotate game night with another GM. Still, the game has progressed slowly, slower than I'd like, in fact, owing partly to group size (now 6 players, has been as high as 9) and partly to our play paradigm (not much "skipping" or "fast-forwarding" in fictional time). And it wasn't until about 2 years ago that I started figuring out how to play more proactively myself, and drive things toward dynamic situation and resolution, rather than stalling indefinitely and parceling out information and progress by minute degrees. So yeah, 6-10 sessions in that context feels just about right.<br/><br/>To answer your second question: Player proactivity has peaked and valley-ed over the years; i've got one player who's been consistently proactive, and early on many other players formed kind of a "party' around her PC. We've since lost players and added new ones (like 4-5 years ago), and the new ones have tended to be pretty "I dunno what to do" about things. I'm trying to coax 'em out of that shell, but it's hard to fight established habit and momentum.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS I wouldn't mind at all if this topic grew beyond "How to fix Joel's game."

I was in an OTE campaign a while back that ran aground after only about four sessions (I was a player). The biggest impediment was that all of us players tended to sit back and wait for the GM to give us interesting things to do, while the GM was much more interested in having us drive things forward.<br/><br/>As I recall, the things that kept us from doing that were pretty clear, at least in retrospect:<br/>- We were small fish dumped in a really big, weird, pond and everybody we ran into had tomes full of secrets. We each had our one little secret. So we didn't feel that special.<br/>- Everybody in the setting had connections and plots - it was very well worked out. We had each other, and we didn't even really know each other, we just happened to come in on the same plane.<br/>- We each had personal goals (find my missing son, find and take over a mysterious ninja cult, stuff like that). But we didn't have any idea how to take little steps toward that goal, so we looked to the GM to provide them.<br/><br/>Some of this was because of the setting. It was impossible to tell what sorts of actions would work in this weird setting, and reality wasn't a very good guide. I could look for my missing son by putting up posters, or hiring a detective, or talking to the cops. But maybe talking to the cops gets is a good idea, or maybe its a really bad idea - there was no way to know. Maybe putting up posters is reasonable, but maybe it leaves traces of your DNA around and you'll get cloned by aliens or something - there was no way to know. It was all very frustrating.<br/><br/>Now, it sounds like this all might not be directly relevant to your situation - you've been playing for eight years here. Frankly, I find that pretty impressive, and feel a little strange trying to give you advice. But the sorts of problems that you're describing seem like the same kinds that we ran into at the very start of our campaign, so maybe there's some overlap.<br/><br/>As far as your immediate situation, I would recommend giving the PCs broad categories of actions that they could take, but not spelling out specific plans. That might be a way of meeting them halfway and getting them to contribute more. For example, any given problem could be  attacked by one of the following methods:<br/>1) Physical assault. (But then how will you do it? What's the plan, and what weapons can you bring to bear?)<br/>2) Socially manipulating someone who has power in the situation. (Who do you go after? How do you investigate what sort of blackmail/threat/bribe/persuasion will work against them? How do you get into a situation where you can interact with them closely?)<br/>3) Calling in allies. (Who do you call? What do you expect they might do?)<br/>4) Something Weird. (Your buddy's trapped - maybe you can transfer his soul/mind out while leaving his body trapped? Maybe you can dig up a time machine and keep him from getting captured in the first place?)<br/>5) etc., etc. You can probably come up with other broad categories.<br/><br/>The idea is to have a semi-formalized list of Ways to Attack Problems. Once the PCs decide on a Way, you can question them to pull out specific details of their plan. When the question is too open-ended, it's possible for players to get frozen; by channeling things a little maybe you can get them to start being more proactive without having to have one of your NPCs come up with the whole plan.<br/><br/>The second bit of advice is to let them succeed. No matter what plan they come up with. Now you don't have to do this forever, but at least when you're starting to get them used to coming up with their own plans, let any wacky idea they have work brilliantly. Later you can ramp this down. But there's nothing more frustrating than being told you have to come up with a plan, spending an hour on it, and then having it fail miserably (often because the GM's assumptions of how reality works aren't the same as the players'). If that happens two or three times in a row, then you'd better believe the players will start waiting for the GM to spoon-feed them a plan of action, because at least there's the hope that there's fun down that road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126279/#Comment_126279" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T14:17:00+00:00" title="February 13, 2008  2:17PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2008 2:17PM by DannyK.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><br/>It seems like the players have gotten used to having answers provided for them, and have retreated into "I'm just playing my character" disengagement.

I believe this community has difficulty visualizing other kinds of traditional gameplay outside of, say, the dungeon crawl.<br/><br/>There is no need for you to make a story and give chunks of it to the PCs. Rather, Al-Amaja is already set up as a large network where even visiting a particular barrio triggers meaningful activity in the environment. It's enough to let the PCs know that something is happening and make *them* invest in revealing it through their own efforts. The setting is an engine that produces stories based on what the characters put into it. The typical structure for this kind of game (which, incidentally, is also the way Vampire works) is that while there is a GM-generated plotline, the players relate to it by making use of their own network within the setting. That means, for instance, that if there's some mystery about a psychic that the GM starts up, the players are the ones who, for instance, connect it to the Mr. LeThuys because of their contacts. The basic site and situation based entry points to player contact are fairly well-coded into things, so it is not difficult to make this happen.<br/><br/>So as I said: Back off and give the PCs time to proactively build relationships in Al-Amarja, so they can draw on these to take true ownership of the setting and storyline.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126543/#Comment_126543" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:29:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: balthazar</cite>Now, it sounds like this all might not be directly relevant to your situation - you've been playing for eight years here.

I said nothing about a "story-games" vs. "traditional" approach.

There's no kind of "make a story and give chunks of it to the PCs" thing going on--you've inferred that. The whole game has been the PCs wandering around encountering the setting, and me trying like mad to present the setting in a way that relates to each character's setting. The problem we're encountering is that the players don't seem to know what to do with all the info. Also, as i originally said there <i>has</i> been some player proactivity, it just kind of comes in awkward spurts, as the PCs' actions drive things forward then come to a screeching halt as the players get stumped. As for your statement, "It's enough to let the PCs know that something is happening and make *them* invest in revealing it through their own efforts." i'm having a hard time understanding how that's different from "advice. . .about how to push the players around."

That's why I'm concentrating more now on modifying my own behavior; if I can't break the cycle completely at least I can, like, not play into it. I'm also doing something else about it, but I'll get to that down below when I reply to Aaron.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>I keep imagining dead silence as you do your best to GM, but it could be that everyone's loud and enthusiastic, but flapping their gums.</blockquote>\nYeah, more of the second.

Bear in mind that I'm describing the <i>shitty half</i> of the game here; I'm not describing the fun parts that are player-driven and exciting, or the little bits of dialogue and description that has everyone going "whoa!" or laughing their asses off. Those moments do exist, and constitute genuine enjoyment on all our parts. I think we can have an ending that, while not as rewarding as a more focused, finely-honed game, will still bring its own satisfaction. A couple of players have in fact expressed excitement at the prospect of any campaign <i>ending at all</i>, that is, purposefully instead of just petering out and fading away. SO that's work sticking around a couple of months for, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127437/#Comment_127437" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T22:23:31+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 10:23PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Aaron!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>Trying actual advice for a moment: Why don't you?

I might consider going back <i>some</i>day, with <i>some</i> group of people, to run a game in that manner, but right now I'm ready to move on to something else entirely.<br/><br/>Which is what you're suggesting of course. I already gave my reasons for riding out the campaign in my reply to Joe, but that doesn't mean I can't try new things in the meantime. I've been getting together semi-regularly with some other story-gamers in my area to try out new games and such, and I've also found a way to mix things up with my regular group, as I alluded to Joe. It kind of fell into my lap, really--one of the players (the aforementioned consistently proactive one), started playing a D&amp;D game on a different night with a friend who wanted to try roleplaying. She invited her favorite folks from the Friday night group to join, and suddenly, voila, the core of folks that I really enjoy playing with, who are engaging and proactive and fun, are all together and having tons of fun! One player put it something like this: "The old group is cool, in this sorta, 'get together and bullshit all night, and get a little playing done' kinda way. But it's so amazing to actually do some focused roleplaying."<br/><br/>So there's light at the end of the tunnel. I'm already considering the new Sunday group to be my "regular" gaming group, and the Friday game to be just this other thing I'm doing, for now. So thanks everyone for the advice, support and perspective. If anyone still wants to discuss these issues in a larger context, great!

Sometimes it's really blatant, like your "GM's Girlfriend" scenario. Other times it's more subtle, like "X and Y are best friends, so so Y tends to back up X's GMing decisions, and X tends to support and riff off of Y's player input more." Or a million other permutations.<br/><br/>Elsewhere on the web I was talking more about the social dimension of my group WRT murkiness on the fictional input level, and Ron Edwards said this: "The reason the situation [murkiness of input] persists is because one or more group members are used to exploiting it for minor advantages." That seems to match up with your girlfriend example pretty well. What do you think? Are there any other examples besides the girlfriend of this kind of thing taking place, maybe at a subtler level? And I'm curious, how does your GM feel about all this, do you think? Is he just fine with playing a heavy input-coordinating role, and humming merrily along now that he's broken up with Whiny Girl? Or is there any kind of reluctance to play that role, like I was expressing upthread?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128922/#Comment_128922" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T22:41:21+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 10:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is funny, really.<br/><br/>He finally says <b>no </b>to her.
