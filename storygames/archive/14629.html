It's influenced by Danger Patrol which, afaict, has a vastly simpler example of the same thing.<br/><br/>Each encounter is ascribed a Threat value. This assumes the encounter will feature antagonists of some kind and some kind of opposition or goal if only just to defeat the enemies. To beat the encounter and move forward, the players must reduce that value to zero. At this point they win: all remaining opposition is neutralised.<br/><br/>There are only three things a PC can do, using whatever appropriate skills/talents and abilities he has:<br/>1. He can directly act to reduce the threat, doing so if his effort succeeds.<br/>2. He can manouevre into some position to enable him to do this if not otherwise able.<br/>3. Neither; ie his choice of activity will do none of the above.<br/><br/>For example: the PC's reach the villain stronghold where the bomb is going to be launched by the villain. The PC's have to deal with the villain and his henchmen as well as the bomb. The Threat value assigned to this is reduced by either: attacking the villain, his henchmen, or directly working on the bomb. In the meantime the antagonists will of course attack. Any action that affects those three things will reduce the Threat value. Once that value is reduced, regardless of all other factors, the players win. If they reduced it by solely fighting the villain then it is assumed that, with the enemies removed, they can easily defuse the bomb. Conversely, if they reduced the Threat by concentrating solely on the bomb, it is assumed that, with their weapon removed, neautralising the villain and his mooks was a foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>This way there's no need to keep track of individual NPC stat values except the bare essentials - their ability to influence or harm the players. No need to track their health points or such.<br/><br/>When dealing with antagonists that aren't part of the Threat (ie attacking them will not contribute to Threat reduction), the player can give them a Capture token (tokens are easily tracked visually though other methods are entirely possible). During the round when an enemy would act while in possessions of any such tokens, they simply remove a token instead. No need to track damage/hit points for NPC's, just a means to keep them from acting which can be narratively described as the attacker sees fit, which is the point of this system.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
