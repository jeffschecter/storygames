Someone who has done a lot of storytelling or read a lot of books before may think the payoff is to listen to, or tell, a cool story - what are all these die rolls for?<br/><br/>For me, coming in to story games was a breeze, an eye-opener in many ways, because I had played a lot of role playing games before but rarely got that payoff I was looking for - the payoff of telling a dynamic, high-quality story, mostly in real-time, with a group of good friends. For others, the very idea of that is meaningless and holds no payoff.<br/><br/>The best approach, IMHO, is to discuss these expectations and accurately represent the game you're pitching. Be careful with comparisons, because they contain baggage - saying that playing Dogs in the Vineyard is like playing D&amp;D paladins but adapted to mormons in the Wild West is true in one sense, but also totally false and misleading in another sense. Saying that IAWA is a sword and sorcery RPG is true in one sense, but will set strange expectations if someone has played the d20-based Conan RPG in another sense.<br/><br/>After you're convinced that you know a person's expectations and preferred payoffs in perfect detail, try a game that matches them. Throwing game after game at them until something sticks is wearying and is likely to get you nowhere.<br/><br/>Never play with people whose payoffs cannot be met by the game you're playing. They will invariably bring the game to its knees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288506/#Comment_288506" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T11:29:47+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 11:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2010 11:30AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't even understand the OP.

("It's your turn, so you say what your guy is doing to achieve (or not achieve) his best interests, such as killing the snitch.") <br/><br/>If 2, then questions and suggestions are good.

No matter what you do, your efforts may fall short. There is no telling if a new players takes to this kind of leisure. It helps to give them a good introduction, but a good result is not guaranteed.<br/><br/>Yes:<br/>- be forewarned about players new to rpgs/storygames; they may need to be told beforehand what to expect, and how to deal with the situations. So make an effort on their behalf; explaining, showing the moves, telling them "you simply do so ...". <br/>- if you're in the middle of it, and a player seems to be out of it; take a break, send out the other players, ask questions about the stumble-stones, and help the player in (doing this alone with him, will make you an ally of him, and raise his confidence in the game-situation)<br/>- if a player claims to have "no imagination", you just helps them understand that this is no worse than having a conversation; you have to come up with a normal reply to a normal statement. Here you have to make normal comments on what may happen, and that is enough to take the game further. <i>Say the first thing that comes to mind, and bugger being smart or creative!</i><br/><br/>No:<br/>- the social situation may be wrong; and no speech from you will change it<br/>- the activity is all wrong for this player, and no advise will make it so<br/>- somehow his mindset is locked in a perception of the game that makes it impossible for him to enjoy it<br/>- he has no patience to learn new tricks; he's an old dog, he is, and you are not the bitch he needs to get going ...<br/><br/>I've taken understanding of the game-procedures for granted time and again, and been punished for it (with bewildered, despondent and sour players). It is natural for us to forget how strange the procedures we've trained for over years, is perceived to the newbie. This is especially true for grown-up newbies. Some grown-ups have no mind for new things, and stumbles when we take for granted that they have gotten the message. We make the mistake of talking too fast and too little, and don't see that they need good examples and patient teachers to grasp it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288511/#Comment_288511" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T12:01:12+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 12:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If he doesn't really want to try -- if he's telling you that he doesn't know what to do, that he doesn't see the point, and that it's not his thing -- why force him?

When I'm in the spotlight and speak for my character, and that makes the game objectively <i>better</i> than if I manipulate them in tyrannical author-stance, I hit massive personal payoff. Burning Empires is a great example of this. Donjon, sort of, another one.<br/><br/>IAWA is a tricky one; on the one hand it's totally competitive and the best interests are clearly defined, but on the other hand the tools at my disposal are more fluid and up for discussion. The final attributes (With Love, For Others, etc) helps this a lot compared to the early playtest ones (Art, Grace, Guts) and the We Owe list helps to discourage people from always using their best available option, but in the end the game doesn't feel quite as impartial and clear cut as it needs to for me to play it no-holds-barred. It is more of a collaborative story-telling exercise informed by the best interests than it is a totally competitive game you play to win.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is the traditional example I fall back on when discussing the pitfalls of play-to-win games, though. When people play the game to win, they bring in all kinds of d6s and d4s into every conflict, no matter how believable; "My horse is looking threatening as I intimidate you (d6), and my cousin has warned you about me (2d6), and this fish I got out of the river that's hanging from my belt sure is ugly (d4)". Sure, this screws them in the end with a pile of fallout, but in the short term that just leads to a character with even more d4s to draw upon in time of need. I find Dogs really does require restraint and a willingness to accept defeat rather than compromising the coherency of the story. Furthermore, I think that attitude is <i>good</i> for Dogs play - but the players all have to get that for the resulting story to really fit.<br/><br/>What it comes down to, and to bring this back to the thread's purpose, is to make it clear what sorts of actions are beneficial to the game, and what sorts of payoffs one can expect from the game. If that's not clear, whether by accidental misrepresentation or by prior assumptions, the game's not going to work for people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288829/#Comment_288829" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T13:17:34+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  1:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>IAWA is a tricky one; on the one hand it's totally competitive and the best interests are clearly defined, but on the other hand the tools at my disposal are more fluid and up for discussion.
