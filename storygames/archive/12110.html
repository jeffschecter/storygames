I moved this discussion over here to let that thread focus on its actual topic, GNS analysis. Having the premise of the discussion debated in the same thread isn't very conducive to clear thinking, I imagine.<br/><br/>So, continuing where I left of with the resident GNS sceptic, Jason:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>My sense from our interaction is that you, Jason, probably mostly play in a narrativist mode, so maybe you just have trouble believing that somebody could actually play that daredevil-cop thing without actually being interested in having the character face a genuine moral conundrum over what amounts to a character quirk in a certain sort of cop buddy movie.</blockquote>\n(Well, I don't believe in GNS, so I don't really identify with any of the modes, I think it's all garbage.)<br/><br/>But again, you are drawing a distinction between two things that are exactly the same.  There is no "genuine" moral conundrum in any play. That's why it's play! Nobody is really going to be shot and killed when a Dogs in the Vineyard PC guns someone down.  It's a fantasy, it's imagination, it's what-if.  We figure out what happens and are interested to see what happens next.<br/><br/>I think what you imagine is that the person who is primarily interested in replicating buddy-cop drama (or comedy) isn't interested in his character's decision as to (for example) cover up his partner's mistake to protect him from Internal Affairs versus ratting him out, because, hey, that happens in buddy-cop dramas all the time.  But I think that turns things on its head.  The person who is primarily interested in buddy-cop drama story gaming is<i>highly</i>interested in things that happen in buddy-cop dramas all the time.  They're highly engaged in those moments.  They have to be, by virtue of their interest. If they aren't, if they really don't care what their character does in those moments, or what will happen to them as a result of their decision, they really aren't as interested in the material as we thought they were.<br/><br/>(We're discussing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_cop_film" rel="nofollow">buddy cop genre</a> as an example of something you might draw from in highly dramatic gaming. Jason's essentially saying that there is no such thing as GNS mode, while I'm trying to explain to him how people can be interested in doing dramatic emulation of cop drama for different reasons.)<br/><br/>You know Jason, I think you convinced me; GNS is clearly simply confused terminology, better get rid of it.<br/><br/>Or, less ironically: I'm not actually just speculating here, I've played my fair share of simulationistic games, including highly stylized genre-sim. My own experience is that I'm interested in affirmation of the dramatic rules of the genre in question when I'm playing a game like this. That is, I'm interested by the cop getting chewed on by his Sergeant because I'm excited about my competence in knowing exactly what scene needs to follow from the one in which the cop caused a political scandal by breaking into the mayor's house and getting caught in his bedroom. I'm also interested in seeing the dramatic logic unfold: what will we think up in the dialogue to justify why my character is still on the force and on the trail of the drug lords even after his faux pas? All this works to reinforce my character's nature as a daredevil and rules-breaker who gets away with it glamorously, very unlike his partner the by-the-book cop. This interests me because I signed up to play the game because I wanted to wisecrack like Eddie Murphy and get away with it to begin with.<br/><br/>In contrast, a narrativist approach to similar content would be to put the elements celebrated by the sim approach under critical consideration: was it worth it for my character to break procedure if it means losing his job? What are the consequences for the police commissioner if he lets me get away with it? These sorts of questions do not occur in genre-faithful play because the genre has already presupposed them away: it'd be a rather strange and iconoclastic cop adventure comedy thingy where the daredevil archetype would be fucked with a baton like that in the first act of the movie. Now, it's notable that you can do narrativism-within-a-genre, but that sort of play tends to gloss over the scenes that don't have genuine stakes; if we know that our genre prevents really serious consequences to the daredevil cop, then we simply don't play the official reprimand scene, or only deal with it in passing towards whatever it is that we see as a genuine conflict in the genre.<br/><br/>I think that these are pretty different approaches, myself: one viewpoint is to reaffirm predetermined thematic value by acting out genre conventions, while the other is to determine the thematic message yourself by recognizing and resolving dramatic situations. One approach to character identity is to affirm the player's character vision, while the other is to allow the pressures of the story to shape that vision. I don't really see how these are the same thing aside from the fact that both deal with stories and story-creation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271138/#Comment_271138" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T11:49:36+00:00" title="May 14, 2010 11:49AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Similar to "climate sceptic" I don't get the term "GNS sceptic" - it should be "GNS denier", surely?

In this way we seek to produce real experiences ... <br/><br/>- and sometimes we really succeed in doing so; our experiences from the game create genuine human conditions in us, individually or as a group. Our immersion is so total that there is no real divide between our strongest game-experience and a real life one. We may call it flow, or nirvana, or a higher form of consciousness ... whatever. The point is that some of us have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">been there</span>.

The other tries to deconstruct it, or isn't informed by the genre at all. They're very dissimilar approaches. The post you're quoting seems to state that genre cliches necessarily become important choice points in a genre-oriented campaign. I don't agree: if some option isn't possible in the source material, it shouldn't be an option in the game either, unless deconstructing, rather than emulating, is your goal. Choices should occur only when there's room for variety in the source material.

It's not a challenge and the gm is actively working to reveal his preplanned plot so as long as the players come up with a semi-reasonable plan we end up finding out what is happening.    Things like the cop who is pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable get's glossed over because what we're doing is solving the crime and catching the bad guys.  We throw things in like the rebel cop for a little bit of spice but we dont want too much spice cause that'll spoil the soup.

The people in those examples are...well, they aren't people, that's for damn sure.  They're robots or aliens or some kind of hyper-specialized freaks, because real people could/would never adhere so faithfully to those entirely arbitrary little CA boxes.<br/><br/>GNS is a theory in the glorious old-timey philosophical sense -- a clever little scheme which can exist only within the thinker's imagination, not a scientific theory that describes a real-world phenomenon and can be tested.  It works and seems coherent enough in the big picture ("What do people want out of games, generally, and what can games do to provide those things to people?"), but falls apart in a really ugly way when you get down to detailed cases.  The moment we cross the line from talking about GNS theory in a purely speculative, wide-angle way to talking about GNS theory as though it can tell us how two different people would play a buddy-cop game, we're pretty much screwed.  GNS theory can't do that, it has nothing meaningful to say on a personal level like that.  It cannot account for the complexities of actual human behavior except by pulling so far back that all those complexities can be safely lost in the distance and can therefore be treated as simple, uniform dots: this one is gamist, this one is narrativist, etc..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271158/#Comment_271158" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T13:24:09+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  1:24PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I think that these are pretty different approaches, myself: one viewpoint is to reaffirm predetermined thematic value by acting out genre conventions, while the other is to determine the thematic message yourself by recognizing and resolving dramatic situations.

You seem to think that they're imposed by some external force - not so, they are picked very much because of player interest in them.  The very reason they're interested in the genre, or group of stories, or whatever classification it is, is exactly because they're interested in what characters in those genre situations do and what comes of it. We can even use your example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>That is, I'm interested by the cop getting chewed on by his Sergeant because I'm excited about my competence in knowing exactly what scene needs to follow from the one in which the cop caused a political scandal by breaking into the mayor's house and getting caught in his bedroom. I'm also interested in seeing the dramatic logic unfold: what will we think up in the dialogue to justify why my character is still on the force and on the trail of the drug lords even after his faux pas?</blockquote>\nThat is exactly the same, <i>exactly</i>, what-you-call the narrativist is interested in: the dramatic consequences of character action.  Just as you can be disappointed in a Dogs in the Vineyard game where the GM says, "He gives in" too soon, you can be disappointed in a buddy-cop Feng Shui game where the GM gives a crap reason for you still being on the force. There are outcomes in all games that potentially disappoint our expectations of what the consequences of our character's decision should be.  But to say that the genre fan doesn't care about the consequences because they have a strong expectation of what they should be is self-contradictory.  Of course they care about the consequences, that's why they have the expectation that they do. That's part of their decisionmaking when they think about what their character is going to do in a particular situation.  Just as you might have an expectation about how far a Dogs NPC will push things, or how bad a Dogs Town will get, that expectation can be disappointed or off-target based on how other participants at the table see things.<br/><br/>Again, take the PTA example. If you have "Police Officer" on your sheet, but it's not your spotlight episode, the pilot or the season finale, you know for a fact, a dead-on fact that you're going to be a police officer at the end of the episode.  A decision to sass the Sergeant in such a situation is based on your knowledge of the rest of the fiction as well as your character.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>We should all be sceptics and ask questions to become wiser, not simply, and stupidly I might add, "don't believe in GNS".</blockquote>\nHey, cool, I'm stupid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271159/#Comment_271159" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T13:24:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  1:24PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>To me there is a strong link between<i>simulation</i>and<i>immersion</i>.

To someone who'se never played G or N, it's literally the whole of roleplaying.  It's essentially "roleplaying that manages to be fun without a G or N to hold it together."  So what does hold it together?  A lot of the stuff that holds any social activity together.  Listening to each other, trying to engage with each other, investing in the activity, etc.  "Affirming the right to dream" and "constructive denial" and "aesthetic constraints" are just more specific ways of saying that.<br/><br/>To say anything more interesting, we need to chop Ron's "Right to Dream" into smaller categories with newer and better names.  His simulationism essay actually takes a stab at this, although his categories (High Concept, Purist for System, etc.) don't thrill me personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271164/#Comment_271164" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T13:30:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  1:30PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ThomasHVM: I've engaged in simulationist play where immersing in my character was the farthest thing from my mind.

We look at a group in play we can see they are obviously competing.  Watch them longer and we can even discerning what they are competing over and what skills are in play.  Similarly, we watch another group and we can clearly see that they are grappling with the issues the fiction raises.  Watch them longer and we can even talk about exactly what issues are and aren't at stake.<br/><br/>But some groups aren't doing either of those things.  There's nothing competitively interesting going on, nor are there any real-world issues at stake.  They're just "making stuff up".  They just like the fact that their guy is shooting a laser beam at some bad guys.  The fact that it isn't tactically interesting doesn't matter.  And the fact that he's a faceless bad guy with no thematic weight doesn't matter.  His guy got to shoot a laser and that's cool to think about.<br/><br/>The problem is that when that's going on there must be SOME standard of participation.  It must be cool to contribute something and not cool to contribute something else.  The fundamental question becomes: Who gets to decide?  What BASIS is there for judging each other's input?  There's where the whole is it "reality"?  Is it "genre"?  Is it "The Marvel Universe circa 1982"?  Is it "The Marvel Universe circa 1982 but as if it were all grounded in a reality?"  Hell is it, "The thematic story dynamics the GM has chosen"? Communicating that standard of participation is actually REALLY, REALLY difficult if you aren't playing with a bunch of raving fans already.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271169/#Comment_271169" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T13:47:56+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  1:47PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Accounting for taste, it may not work for you but for me it makes a ton of sense.

I played some Old school D&amp;D; that was clearly gamist, then I've played some old D&amp;D; that clearly wasnt.  I played Star Trek that was almost Narrativist but we really struggled with how to continue play once players started making choices that addressed premise and broke the mold.  I've played in a long series of Gurps campaigns that are very much sim and very much the purist for system style of sim that Ron Edwards spoke of in his essay.

It seems like the narrativist wants to be immersed in the character so deeply that he's feeling the character wrestle with the moral issues while the genre-emulator may just be going through the motions because having his character get chewed out by his sergeant is "the right thing to do" with respect to his genre expectations.<br/><br/>The definition of Narrativism has gotten a little fuzzy for me. Is that immersion in emotionally wrestling with "the premise" the core of narrativist play? Or is the dynamic story creation the core? The lack of simple bright-line tests for non-experts to identify G, N, or S play indicates to me that they aren't well understood concepts. If we're genre-emulating a genre in which the characters wrestle with moral issues, how to we tell if we're playing N or S?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_271187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271187/#Comment_271187" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T14:19:27+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  2:19PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2010 2:20PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul88</cite>In my experience of gaming some players like to get emotionally involved some not.</blockquote>My experience too. And more: many players I have GMed have had misgivings about delving into their character, but when encouraged and supported in the right way, they find it a great experience.<br/><br/>So in my experience this is all about playing on the same team, doing things together, and being generous with eachother in the game-situation. That is very much true for the simulationist stance I'm talking about.<br/><br/>It is seldom to see gameplay with Sim being dominant. I strive to do it, but more often than not ends up with an even mix of Sim and Gam, sometimes heavily influenced by Nar. Most gameplay in classical games is like that.<br/><br/>Most gameplay in modern games is leaning heavily on Nar. For the reasons Robert describes here:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Part of the reason that I like a lot of dirty-hippie mechanics developed for highly emotional Narr style character play is that they can be easily repurposed to support that particular approach to Sim.</blockquote>I do not share in this "Nar-stance and mechanics will save all gameplay" kind of idea. In my view a lot of the Nar-play gives you a hard time really identifying with your character. As a consequence a lot of these games, although great fun at first contact, fail to deliver really profound and heart-rendering experiences.<br/><br/>That is my personal view, of course, and I am aware of players disagreeing heartily with me. But still I maintain that this is a potential weakness in all such games, and this weakness should not be overlooked by conscientious designers. These are the kind of challenges which need to be met, to make our games work wonders for more players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271190/#Comment_271190" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T14:21:44+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  2:21PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2010 2:24PM by komradebob.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>ThomasHVM: I've engaged in simulationist play where immersing in my character was the farthest thing from my mind.

They're just not finding any use in it, and like good and active culture participants are thus questioning it for our mutual erudition. GNS isn't some holy crusade where you need to have firm and vehement convictions, I find - for me it's a descriptive theory of roleplaying and nothing more; useful as a basic starting point for analysis, but nothing that I have a great need to advocate as a panacea for practical problems others have. If I show any sort of absolutist passion about it, that's just because I've used the theory myself routinely and successfully so often that any proposition that begins with "GNS is rubbish" simply doesn't fit into my experience without extensive discussion of how it's possible for us to have such different experience.<br/><br/>(The above is in clarification: I didn't exactly intend to start an arbitrary debate here with the intent of proving the truth once and for all. Rather, I just wanted to discuss this thing with Jason without messing up the other thread. I'm enjoying the different perspectives on simulationism, heterodox as they may occasionally be.)<br/><br/>Jason: if I understand you correctly, you're saying that my examples of narrativistic and simulationistic attitudes are similar because both are committed to a robust fiction and well-crafted drama wherein consequence follows from action and so on and so forth. I do not dispute this. However, the part I don't get is why you don't see a difference in the agenda of the players, what they're trying to achieve as the end-state of their play. For instance, when I wrote that the difference between sim and nar is that one reaffirms preset theme to enjoy it while the other enjoys the act of creating theme, you said that these are the same thing. It is rather plain to me, however, that these are not at all the same. When I go into that cop buddy game with my daredevil character, in the sim version of the game we've already established that the buddyhood lives forever and there will be a time and place for breaking the rules for the greater common good; the point of play is to celebrate buddyhood and the two-man sentai party the cop buddies form. On the other hand, when I go into a narrativist game that actually doesn't have a preset theme, but rather questions the assumptions of the buddy cop genre as its basis, then all bets are off: will the friendship endure cultural and philosophical differences? Will the power of friendship win the day? To me it seems plain as day that the fundamental purpose of why we're playing these two different games about the same topical matter is different in each case, characterized as "Story Now" vs. "Right to Dream" in Ron's quirky lexicon. In one game we're driving towards conflict, in the other we're driving towards affirmation.<br/><br/>Of course this sort of comparison is confused by the fact that mere genre-fidelity does not mean that all potentially interesting conflicts in a story are already resolved before the story begins. Aside from intentional genre-breaking and deconstruction most literary genres tend to have a core set of issues that are very much available for free resolution. For instance, one might argue that the cop buddy genre doesn't predetermine the relationship of heroes and buddies to women; you might know that the cop buddies will get the bad guy at the end, but you don't really know whether they'll do it after setting aside the woman who came in between them, or whether they'll manage to make their peace with adulthood and allow one or both members of the pair to have a relationship outside the duo, or perhaps for some other reason entirely. In this regard it's possible to have narrativism "inside" a genre as opposed to as deconstruction of the genre. A matter of focus, nothing more.<br/><br/>Still, no matter how we focus a given campaign, that doesn't change the fact that we're doing such focus for a reason, and that reason reflects on our core activity in playing the game. For a narrativistic game the core activity tends to be conflict-based, so much so that modern narrativism seems to consistently run on the precept of recognizing and handling dramatic conflicts efficiently. In comparison, simulationistic gaming concerns itself with experiencing the fiction, which activity causes even the same fictional material to be handled differently: instead of a conflict we see an opportunity for affirmation, instead of challenge of character identity we see an opportunity to reaffirm the same. These are so different activities that I'm not really sure how you can claim that they're the same thing, except by not having practical experience of both.<br/><br/>Of course we're not going to convince each other by insisting on our own perception of how different games and game experiences work. If I'm convinced that I'm seeing GNS agendas in my direct experiences of play and Jason thinks that he's never seen them, then of course the best we can do is to make sure we all understand the theoretical framework clearly and leave it at that. Luckily, as I intimated above, it's not such a serious matter if people disagree about GNS. It's such a theoretical issue that I don't really care about anybody's opinion on the matter so long as they're still on this side of the "system does matter" principle. (If you happen to think that different game systems do not matter as a part of your play even that's OK with me, it's just likely that we can't practically play together because I'm not that interested in freeform roleplaying. It's game or nothing for me, I fear.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271194/#Comment_271194" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T14:27:58+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  2:27PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2010 2:29PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>To rephrase your questions:<br/>- 1 - What different kinds of Sim are there or could there be?</i><br/><br/>Heavy emulation-of-genre can be counter-immersive, but would still fall into the category as written.

That doesn't mean the PROCESS which created it was identical.<br/><br/>In one group, the "friendship" is open question being evaluated and at risk every step of the way.  In the other group the "friendship" issue is a given up front and at every step of the way choices are made to guarantee its preservation.<br/><br/>And don't forget the role of system here.

If you claim that it doesn't matter whether theme is chosen before play or established in play, then of course you won't see any difference between simulationism and narrativism - that's basically the extent of their difference. Also, I have those same experiences Jesse has with sim/nar clash.<br/><br/>I like Tomas's angle as a passionate expression of what he wants out of roleplaying, but that really doesn't have that much to do with GNS simulationism. One basic result of Big Model theory is that our specific relationships to the characters played in a game are actually somewhat arbitrary technical matters that are best resolved by referencing the psychological and cultural state of the players themselves - that is, we play characters in an immersive relationship or advocation relationship or some such relationship because characters are interesting and intuitive for humans as a conduit for handling the GNS issues of experiencing fiction, facing challenges and creating story. Character immersion is a well-preferred technique for play because it's amechanical and anti-intellectual as regards the means provided to the player for playing the game, but it's not inherently tied to any individual Creative Agenda mode. I've seen Nordic immersionism game texts for both narrativism and simulationism, and I'm pretty sure that I could sketch a gamist immersionist game, too, if it came to that.<br/><br/>Anyway, interesting angles on the matter. I would like to suggest that we probably have too much posting and too many different angles in this thread for comprehensive dialogue, so there's no need to try for such. I'll just pick out some random ideas that strike me as comment-worthy. For the rest of you I'll just say that I'm probably going to agree with anything Jesse says about GNS stuff <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>It seems to me that this is backwards with respect to Eero's rogue cop example. It seems like the narrativist wants to be immersed in the character so deeply that he's feeling the character wrestle with the moral issues while the genre-emulator may just be going through the motions because having his character get chewed out by his sergeant is "the right thing to do" with respect to his genre expectations.<br/><br/>The definition of Narrativism has gotten a little fuzzy for me. Is that immersion in emotionally wrestling with "the premise" the core of narrativist play? Or is the dynamic story creation the core? The lack of simple bright-line tests for non-experts to identify G, N, or S play indicates to me that they aren't well understood concepts. If we're genre-emulating a genre in which the characters wrestle with moral issues, how to we tell if we're playing N or S?</blockquote>\nDan, narrativism by itself is agnostic over the matter of how deep your character identification is. Narrativism is technically defined as a joint effort by the group in presenting dramatic conflict and resolving it, thus creating theme, thus achieving thematic ("meaningful") storytelling. Especially that moment of resolution as an artistic statement is a source of enjoyment, but different games go about achieving it differently; some have deep character immersion, others only superficial.<br/><br/>As for simple tests, I guess those are possible, but only once you're exact enough with language. RPG theory is difficult exactly because the imaginary structures manipulated in playing aren't very substantial, so we're forced to use vague words in describing the things used. I could say that "Narrativism is the effort of achieving artistic satisfaction by dynamic story creation in within a Shared Imagined Space", or I could say that "Narrativism is the effort of conclusively resolving a Premise in a robust Exploratory context", and I'm pretty sure that I could find some theory-heads who'd understand and agree that those are conscise, exact definitions that are both true, albeit describing the concept from different viewpoints.<br/><br/>For your specific confusion I can say that both of your propositions are sort of true: narrativism is both about dynamic story creation and premise-resolution at the same time. This is because narrativist theory defines "story" as "thematic narration resulting from premise-resolution". The premise-based description of the phenomenon is more accurate in that if you want to use the word "story" to mean something that doesn't necessarily entail a premise (non-Egrian literary theory certainly exists), then you don't have to mix up narrativism in those different understandings of what story is. I myself happen to think that the premise-theme model of story creation is remarkably accurate as literary theory, but there seem to be plenty of people who think that Egri is a hack, too. Either way, narrativism isn't really tied to the common-language meaning of story, as it specifically pertains to the creative satisfaction and excitement of premise-resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271206/#Comment_271206" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T15:03:42+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  3:03PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Can I have an example of a genre that's very moral-conflict-heavy?

Replace "Ethical" or even problematic in human terms if you prefer.  War movies have lots issues about brotherhood and loyalty and authority and individual vs group needs and stuff like that going in on that.  If those things aren't "moral" issues to you that's fine.

A movie might very well be devoid of these things and contain lots of "dramay stuff" going on but in fact be devoid of content.  It's a spectacle full of sound and fury but signifying nothing.

You could just as easily call it "fluid" or "responsive": a group which slides its play between categories to suit their needs and moods and desires of the session (or the scene, or the moment) is pretty normal, in my experience.  The only way you can make them fit a neat category is to generalize them in some way.  And that's fine: you can say that Bob typically enjoys foobar in a game, and it doesn't make you a liar when it turns out that tonight Bob's enjoying bargle play.  Bob's just a foobar kind of guy, most of the time.  If he goes for bargle in this scene and everyone else is all like, "Bargle? AWESOME!", it doesn't make them an incoherent group, it just means that like ordinary people everywhere, Bob and his group will sometimes prefer bargle to foobar and will pursue it.<br/><br/>...this is pretty much why I despair when people try to flip the theory around by making up actual-play examples using it.

If your particular experience in a game was really and truly fucked up -- no one wanted the same things ever, no one ever reached consensus on what they wanted, everyone changed their minds about what they wanted from moment to moment with no rhyme or reason -- well, damn, that's awful.  I'd agree that it was totally incoherent, even, in the finest dictionary sense of the word.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you told me that your particular experience in a game had a few moments which didn't fall neatly into a category of play described by one general theory or another (or jumped categories and then jumped back), then I'd nod sagely so as to indicate that you and I are both men of the world and understand that this is how real live human behavior truly is, and the word "incoherent" wouldn't really fit to describe that situation.  Instead, I'd politely ask whether you and your friends had fun in those category-defying moments, because I think that's interesting, and I'd hope that the answer was "Yes, it was fun."

None.  Zero.  I think that's perfect:  that's exactly what theory is for.<br/><br/>I think that theory falls apart when you get down to specific examples, because the theory cannot be as fine-grained as actual human experience and motivations, and so I don't find specific examples created by the theory (or for that matter, specific examples from real life which are filtered exclusively through theory) to be as compelling or believable or useful as someone just telling me about their real-life experience.  So I complain about that.  If you disagree, well, it's not like either of us has any money or honor riding on this argument, so I think we're allowed to just leave it at that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271281/#Comment_271281" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T19:03:55+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  7:03PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Jesse basically says what I was going to say at Jason's latest: it's definitely, definitely process that is the thing about Creative Agendas. If you claim that it doesn't matter whether theme is chosen before play or established in play, then of course you won't see any difference between simulationism and narrativism - that's basically the extent of their difference.</blockquote>\nOh, it definitely matters, design-in-play vs. design-at-start is real, absolutely, but all sorts of other things get decided before and during play too.  Anyway I can never draw a clear distinction between the before- and during-play, because sometimes I invent something new between one breath and the next, and yet it is as new and fresh to the fiction as something I wrote on an index card 9 months before but just haven't introduced yet.  I think that experience has happened to everyone in the hobby.  If I say "the guy's name is Donnie and he's as gay as the day is long", what does it matter to everyone else, or the fiction, if I just now made it up or thought it up 5 years ago and have been waiting for the perfect moment to introduce it?  (What, in the end, does it matter to me?)<br/><br/>Besides, everyone says that design-at-start and design-in-play can be present in all CAs, so clearly that can't be the difference.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>In one group, the "friendship" is open question being evaluated and at risk every step of the way.

You are fully entitled to your opinion about the value of that theory and that analysis, I fail to see why it should be threatened by me explaining my own opinion; I know that mine is hardly threatened by yours.  So if you're looking for a flamewar, look elsewhere, I guess.<br/><br/><i>For me</i> it is true that GNS theory is the wrong tool to usefully analyze real-life play, and that the theory only hangs together properly when you step back from actual moment-to-moment play and think of your gaming in more general terms.

Anyway I can never draw a clear distinction between the before- and during-play, because sometimes I invent something new between one breath and the next, and yet it is as new and fresh to the fiction as something I wrote on an index card 9 months before but just haven't introduced yet.  I think that experience has happened to everyone in the hobby.  If I say "the guy's name is Donnie and he's as gay as the day is long", what does it matter to everyone else, or the fiction, if I just now made it up or thought it up 5 years ago and have been waiting for the perfect moment to introduce it?  (What, in the end, does it matter to me?)<br/><br/>Besides, everyone says that design-at-start and design-in-play can be present in all CAs, so clearly that can't be the difference.</blockquote>\nWell, thematic meaning is different from many other things we prepare for play when stories are our focal interest in the whole activity of play. It's like we were convening to build some birdhouses together and you came to the event with a bunch of birdhouses you bought at a shop and I come with some planks and nails. Your solution is great if we just wanted to put up some birdhouses for the birds, while my solution is better if we wanted to build something together. You can't claim that any prep at all is equivalent, as this sort of preparation strikes directly at the core of the activity itself: we can't build the birdhouse if you already finished it before we even begin. Point being, playing a story game is about playing with theme, not just generally playing; other elements of play can be varied, like I can bring a saw or a hammer, but the thematic content at the core of play cannot be manipulated directly without causing huge changes in the very nature of play.<br/><br/>So I do stand by the notion that prepped theme is contrary to narrativist activity; it's just one of those things you can't bring to the table and expect it to be the center of play if there is narrativism to be had. I could see how this wouldn't be an important detail from a practical viewpoint for somebody who doesn't use these particular tools (premise, theme, so on) at a practical level in design and play, but I'm personally pretty convinced that this is the most fundamental issue behind the procedural design of good story games: the game needs to have a clear stand on how themes are to become part of the story in play, and it needs to have the tools for making this so. For this purpose the divide between narrativism and simulationism is fundamental, as they contradict each other: one requires preset theme, one requires the freedom to create its own.<br/><br/>Really, though, I'm sure that you've heard all of this before. Not very likely that I can make it sound sensible to you if it hasn't so far. My own position on this sort of thing just happens to be pretty firm due to how I've actually used the Big Model framework successfully in my game design and GMing, so it seems strange to get these experiences denied. For instance, if this whole premise-theme model of things is arbitrary and just not very important, how come I've been designing narrativist games laden with premise but devoid of theme for years? Maybe I'm just not as good a designer as I think I am, that'd explain a thing or two <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271354/#Comment_271354" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T05:01:58+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  5:01AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Is that a retreat from whatever position you imagine I've been holding, or is it just both of us saying "No, I think you're wrong about that," for like the third time in a row?</blockquote>\nBoy, you really dance around. You said:<br/><br/><i>..this is pretty much why I despair when people try to flip the theory around by making up actual-play examples using it.

Which, yes, you're right, I didn't read and didn't deal with, because I didn't notice it and usually don't click on links unless they grab my attention in some way.<br/><br/>The first time I addressed <i>anything</i> you've written in this thread was post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2341&amp;Mode=like">#41</a>, where I agreed with what you were saying almost entirely but quibbled about one thing at the end.  And for my part, that's the full extent and compass of our conversation here; I hadn't read whatever's at the other end of that link (obviously, since I didn't even notice it until I went back and looked for posts from you earlier than the one I replied to), and I'm sorry if you thought that I was responding to anything in it.<br/><br/>But whatever.  Water under the bridge.  I've gone and looked at it now, and all I will quote from it is "it's a huge topic that I've simplified and schematised to some degree."  And so I think you made fine use of the theory, analyzing and describing a general overview of your game.  I've never had any complaints about anyone who does that, and have been bending over backwards in this thread to make it clear that I am not complaining about that.  Seriously, go back and look, if you care to.  I've been making a real effort to <i>not</i> trash GNS theory in that respect.  It's fine at the big picture, it's <i>meant</i> for the big picture, that's where its strength lies.  Distilling twelve years of experience in a campaign into a useful and informative analysis, I'm all for that, and don't object to GNS/BM in that context.<br/><br/>If you had taken, say, one scene of one session of your Glorantha game and looked at it through GNS theory and said "this is a fully accurate and complete explanation for what was happening here," we would disagree about that, because I still maintain that GNS theory is not the right tool for that.  <i>But you didn't do that.</i>  I never meant to give you the impression that I was addressing the Glorantha analysis that you actually did, and I certainly didn't mean for you to read anything we've talked about so far as a refutation and misrepresentation of what you actually did.  Mea culpa.  Apparently you and I only managed to talk about the same subject one or two times in this entire flurry of posts, and I wish that one of us had realized it sooner.  (No doubt the poor bastards who've been struggling to skip past our posts feel the same way.)\n<blockquote>You would like to prove that GNS/BM is completely without value, but you can't.

Nor do I agree that games identified as narrativist-supporting indicate that the theme or premise is particularly different. Take PTA - is there any way to describe the selection of a character Issue other than something that happens before play?  Or Town Generation in Dogs, which entails the GM deciding what consequences will occur if the PCs choose a particular reaction to the town's sin (i.e. doing nothing) before anyone ever rides into town.  Or With Great Power, in which before play begins, Beliefs go on a scratch pad, and then one is selected to be relevant to this particular (comic book) Issue, and a player may or may not pick it to be the Strife Aspect that has the spotlight on it. All these things happen prior to play.  GMs in Burning * games come up with NPC Beliefs and Instincts separately from the players - in fact you're very much encouraged to do it exactly that way, non-collaboratively, before the first session of play.  <br/><br/>Now, you are correct, that engaging with the theme is something that happens in play in all these games. But it is also something that happens in play in <i>every game</i> with story as a goal.

Because the game will not support it, and as a result, you flail around trying like crazy to get to the conclusion you picked out in advance. Games like Sorcerer are meant to ask the question, repeatedly, in play - and NOT let you answer it in advance. Dogs is another great example of a game that just sucks wind utterly when played by people who have already set their minds on a particular answer to its questions in advance.<br/><br/>The essential difference between N-supporting play and S-supporting play may be in exactly that: N-support means the game DOES NOT ENFORCE any particular answer to its thematically relevant questions, and indeed may not allow players to effectively enforce one through play. S-support, on the other hand, DOES ENFORCE whatever the "thing that is celebrated" is so that it comes out "right".<br/><br/>Which is not to say that you can't get good, coherent, N or S play out of rules not set up to support one or the other. You just all have to be pulling for the same thing and put your own structure in place to get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271421/#Comment_271421" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T11:43:36+00:00" title="May 15, 2010 11:43AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2010 11:45AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Yes, this is exactly what I've been trying (unsuccessfully, it seems) to say!</blockquote>\nRight.

Whatever his claim about the game, I think it's pretty clear the game works very well in the mode I've described, where people actually think about their characters and their, um, character, while not playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271455/#Comment_271455" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T16:36:02+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  4:36PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, Mark, and others - - here's some AP to back up my agreement with both of you!<br/><br/>I played a game of Polaris in which I was a physician who'd been secretly hired to dispose of mutated babies for a noble family. That premise was actually decided during play, in session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> - - our first session had me delivering a baby because I knew my character was a physician, but I went from being a noble, if ineffectual knight to being a downright murderous scoundrel and liar - and I can safely say that wasn't my initial intention. <br/><br/>We established through play that a Demon artifact - a bronze salamander figurine - had been causing deformities and low birth rate. The scene that changed things for my character - quite unexpectedly - went roughly as follows:<br/><br/><i>My friend Liz:</i> I find a device in your observatory that proves you to be a Demon spy!<br/><i>Me</i>: You ask far too much. <br/><i>Liz</i>: I... find a device in your observatory that tells me to dig in the courtyard.<br/><i>Me</i>: Intriguing... And so it was.<br/>*Liz's character, a Star Knight, enters the courtyard with a shovel. <br/><i>Liz</i>: I find a bronze figure of a salamander beneath the tree. [No conflict from me, so she continues] It's been set there by you, Zac, to poison the fortress's well.<br/><i>Me</i>: Whoa, no, no no - you ask far too much.<br/><i>Liz</i>: It's a Southern artifact that makes babies grow scaly skin and be all mutated [it had been established that her PC's family had delivered several such babies]. And you put it there. Was that the part you objected to?<br/><i>Me</i>: No, I'm intrigued. But I'm not trying to kill everybody!<br/><i>Liz</i>: Okay, so you did put it there, right? [I agree to this] Awesome!<br/><br/>TECHnically, since Liz and I are both portraying Star Knights, we shouldn't be antagonizing each other like this. But it was fun and consensual, so it's all good. From this sequence, our group started to envision my character as much more icky and dark than before - - he might not be a Demon supporter, but he's engaged in some pretty terrible, weird stuff. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm being picky, but I think this scene solidified my concept of the character big-time, and that was stuff I didn't plan at all when I started out. My initial concept was quite simple \u2013 a Star Knight who was also the lead physician for his fortress. While we set the first scene, I was struck with the idea of delivering a baby, and so a very LARPy scene then began (I acted out a rather ill-informed pantomime of delivery; it was good times) that centered on that subject. <br/><br/>The second move, towards being a creepy, dark force in the fastness that was doing unspeakable acts to guarantee his own importance (making the children into deformed stillbirths, and then helping their distraught parents conceal the babes' existence), took things in another, yet more unexpected direction. <br/><br/>As to the source of this shift, I would attribute both our group's ideas and the escalation-of-conflict rules in <i>Polaris</i>. <br/><br/>There! Some nice AP to support my understanding of Narrativism's don't-predetermine-theme element. That, uh, could've been better-worded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271459/#Comment_271459" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T17:02:06+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  5:02PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it sounds to me like it was a combination of some things you worked out "up front", i.e. lead physician, and some things that occurred to you and other players in play.

I wanted some authority and a gun, so I joined the Dogs and jumped on board with all their religious stuff to see what it'd get me.  I was looking to find out whether the King of Life would in fact make me personally potent and powerful for being a Dog.  I was perfectly willing to ditch the Dogs for any better offer that could prove itself.  In my youth I'd been a fan of a badass bounty hunter.  <br/><br/>I came up with all of this pre-play, and told the GM.<br/><br/>The GM set us on a mission where our status as Dogs got us a lot of obedience and sway.  We were opposed by that bounty hunter.  The bounty hunter did all sorts of badass shit.  He told me if I stayed out of his way, he wouldn't kill me.<br/><br/>None of this provided me an obvious answer, and even if it had, it wouldn't have done so quickly, and it would have been a lot of fun to portray my character's decision ("Ah, the bounty hunter is indeed more potent than god, so I'm siding with him!") to the other players.<br/><br/>What actually happened is that I got in a fight with the bounty hunter to see just how tough he really was.  We rolled some dice, and at the end, I was the victor.  So I said, "I guess you weren't stronger after all," killed him, and continued on my path of "righteousness" as a Dog.<br/><br/>I can't say whether this experience was overall cooler or less cool for me than if the GM and I had premeditated exactly how that Dogs/bounty hunter choice would go.  But it was definitely different, and the GM found it more entertaining and manageable than pre-scripting.  My guess is that if the GM had said, "You'll fight this guy," and I'd said, "If I lose, I'll ask to join him; if I win, I'll kill him and stick with the Dogs" before play, actual play would have been muc less fun than it was.  (Relevant note: the fight only resulted from a series of choices made by all teh characters; the GM hadn't pre-determined it as an essential feature of his scenario.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271656/#Comment_271656" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T09:10:21+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  9:10AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The basic problem with the GNS theory, in my experience, is that it gets applied far too broadly.  As soon as you start talking about gamist *players* or simulationist *games*, it's like trying to carve a roast turkey with a scalpel, and the results wind up being messy and unappetizing.  And *none of them* are absolute.<br/><br/>Gamism, simulationism, and dramatism are the three inputs into how the players in the metagame determine what happens in the story-world of the game.  Pure gamism asks the question, "What would make this game most challenging and interesting for the players?" Pure simulationism asks the question, "What would logically happen in the world?" Pure dramatism asks the question, "What would make the best story?"  <br/><br/>So as an example, suppose I'm running a D&amp;D game.  The players swagger into a market on market day.  I ask myself, who would likely be in the marketplace?  That gives me the simulationist aspect.  I ask myself, is there anything here relevant to the characters' histories and goals?  That gives me the dramatist aspect.  I ask myself, if they provoke a combat, what kind of challenge should there be?  That gives me the gamist aspect.  So if I decide that Sir Reharad, the sworn foe of the party's paladin, is trying to buy provisions for his next quest, and spots the party across the plaza, that's got elements of all three -- with the dramatist aspect probably foremost.  If instead I decide that a band of thugs is going to overrun the market to steal money from the vendors, that's again got elements of all three, with the gamist aspect foremost.  And if instead I decide that there's a fishmonger and a couple vegetable carts, and someone selling cloth and someone else selling rare gems, some of which might be plot hooks, that's once again got elements of all three, this time with the simulationist aspect foremost.<br/><br/>So in that formulation -- which is not the same as the Forgeite formulation, but which I think is a good deal more useful if the goal is to talk about action-resolution and not to enforce an orthodox view of Good Roleplaying -- then yes, simulationism exists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271669/#Comment_271669" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T10:08:56+00:00" title="May 17, 2010 10:08AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that dissecting a given scene of play for its G, N, and S content would be an example of interpreting/applying GNS too broadly. <br/><br/>The presence of swaggering PCs in the marketplace... the presence of thugs there, too... these things aren't inherently *anything* in terms of GNS - they're just situations. Detail in the setting is not the same thing as Sim - or any Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>Creative Agendas are agendas held by the, well, a combination of the players and the designers. The designers' agenda manifests in what kind of play they're supporting (for a given concept of "kinds of play", of course); the players' agenda manifests, presumably, in what game mechanics/kinds of game mechanics they focus on, enjoy, etc. Situation/premise itself doesn't really point us to Creative Agenda - in my Polaris example above, you could ostensibly run the same scene with D&amp;D4e, but there'd be a totally different interaction going on, at least as far as <i>the rules could support it</i>.The relationships between people would not be quantified in a D&amp;D4e game; the rules would not specifically help us examine those relationships. <br/><br/>At the same time, I don't think that this makes Polaris a better game than D&amp;D; my goal, and the larger goal of Big Model/GNS, is not at all to prescribe good vs. bad roleplaying. It's descriptive, not prescriptive, but of course that's not the same as individual adherents/partisans being prescriptive. <br/><br/>Charlton - what do you mean about "action-resolution"? And I'm not being coy or feisty when I ask this - what is the utility of analyzing the scenario you proposed from your not-the-same-as-Forgeite perspective? I don't see what it adds to our understanding. Are you trying to capture all three "modes" in a game? That'd be one answer, and there's definitely an approach/response to GNS/Big Model that sees such a goal as the ideal objective. <br/><br/>What it sounds like you're effectively saying here: <blockquote>talking about gamist *players* or simulationist *games*, it's like trying to carve a roast turkey with a scalpel</blockquote> is that one can analyze specific moments for their GNS content. That's basically what Fred/0bs01337 was initially asking - and the answer is no, it's not intended as such. I do agree, however, that these are non-absolute categorizations; the point of the analysis is to then infer how one can design games that *support* a particular form of play.<br/><br/>At this time, the consensus I've observed is that supporting multiple so-defined types of play is not feasible. Yes, describing such unsuitability as "incoherent" is a big, fat Negative-Sounding Term, which does make plenty of us devalue so-called incoherent games. <br/><br/>An example of incoherence in action:<br/><br/>My friends M and Liz are playing a game of Doomtown the CCG with me. The game has some exploratory bits - mainly, you create your Side of the Street in downtown Gomorrah, you rack up influence and Dudes (fighters) and ghost rock (currency), and you try to get an overwhelming lead in influence by pluggin' Dudes and spendin' ghost rock on recruitment and the purchase o' deeds to important places. <br/><br/>During the course of play, M decided inwardly that zhe was going to focus on racking up as much ghost rock as possible; zhe wasn't interested in combat, or winning at all, actually. My cutthroat strategy of startin' gun fights and jumpin' claims on ghost-mines annoyed hir a bit, and we ended up hotly debating what to do when we ran out of poker chips for currency - should we go get some more objects to use for that purpose, or had M effectively "cornered the market" on ghost rock, resulting in a static economy?<br/><br/>In our post-game discussion, M revealed hir complete disinterest in the whole win/loss thing, and Creative Agenda came up. It occurred to me that I was enjoying exploration of the game, yes, but I was firmly interested in who would win or lose. Liz was interested in that too, if not so fervently. <br/>Turns out that M decided to devise hir own "victory" conditions so as to keep the game going as long as possible - because racking up ghost rock would never result in a victory for anyone all by itself, zhe could keep playing indefinitely, seeing what cards were in hir deck, and so on. <br/><br/>My point is that, clearly, we sat down with very different goals and expectations for the game, and we ended up quitting the game before it "officially" ended because of this conflict. Granted, it wasn't a personal conflict; it was just that we were there for different reasons, and didn't want to play *that* game together anymore if we had those things in mind.<br/><br/>M was present in our Polaris game, actually, and our differences were less pronounced here - the story zhe could tell, of a knight outcast from his people, was much more interesting to hir than any sort of competitive exercise could have been. <br/><br/>So yeah - as much as I initially wanted to characterize M as a "Sim player", zhe has a broader interest than that. It reminds me of the Keys analysis (is that what it's called?), wherein you decide what specific things you're looking for overall, outside/beyond just GNS - things like "cooperation", "socializing", etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271681/#Comment_271681" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T11:35:40+00:00" title="May 17, 2010 11:35AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2010 11:41AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of people seem to be saying that the problem with "GNS" is that it doesn't appropriately describe moment-to-moment play. That's fine: that's what the Big Model's for. It has terminology and what-not for the little things that happen in play. Whether you agree with it or not, it's pretty clear on both of those things, I think. "Creative Agenda applies to the big picture; here are some terms for the smaller things."<br/><br/>The thing with G, N, and S is that they are "the three currently recognized Creative Agendas". The model has plenty of room for others, and there's always talk of splitting Sim into various categories: clearly for someone like Tomas there is a world of difference between the heavy immersive thing and the group of gamers who get together to draw cards from a deck and roll dice and enjoy the resulting story that sounds very much like a Batman comic.<br/><br/>That said, the way you can see Creative Agenda at work is not in the type of story being told or something similar, but in the real-life reactions of the players at the table. Do they support that thematic moment your character's involved in? Are they bored by it? Are they offended by the challenge of a certain mechanical interaction, because it threatens the role they perceive their character as filling out? Over time, these things can (but do not always) coalesce into a shared understanding of what a given game is "about".<br/><br/>I'd say that those three categories (Right to Dream, Step on Up, and Story Now) are the most contentious things about the Big Model. I personally find it very fruitful to look at the Big Model thus:<br/><br/>"Here's a bunch of terminology describing the various elements involved in a roleplaying game. Now, when a group of people sit down to play one with a common purpose in mind, as a  creative exercise they all engage in together, they can be said to have a common "Creative Agenda". That's the thing they're all really grooving on together. There's a variety of these. The purpose of talking about Creative Agenda at all is to recognize that there are many different possible Creative Agendas, so we can better analyze problems in play and better design games to help a group of people get on the same page and enjoy what they're doing."<br/><br/>If anything, the biggest gain the online roleplaying culture we're discussing has drawn from the Big Model is an understanding of the variety of playstyles. Once you recognize that the group over there is looking for something different from gaming than you are in your weekly game, you can open your mind to figuring out what it is and playing along, enjoying this new thing you hadn't tried before. That was a huge eye-opener for a lot of people, and I think quite an accomplishment. (There are, of course, many people out there who came to this understanding on their own--perhaps you are one of them, JDCorley--it's not some brilliant new invention, but a simple observation of what's going on. For the rest of the people who heard about it, though, it was a worthy new idea.)<br/><br/>In any case, I think it helps to think of the Big Model in those terms: yeah, it's a model. It talks about Creative Agenda being important (this group of people playing this game, now, and all trying to get the same thing out of it, as a powerful unifying basis for play). But the three categories are very, very broad, and don't begin to describe every possible permutation. Ron Edwards himself often says things like, "we played this game as a light Narrativist exercise, with a big serving of tactical challenge". There's an infinite number of possible Creative Agendas out there; the only aim behind "G, N, and S" is to vaguely aim at recognizing three camps or varieties that many of them might fall into. <br/><br/>But if you can't get behind those three, you can still get a lot out of the Big Model and the concept of Creative Agenda. <br/><br/>It's much more useful and important to recognize the specific, real-life Creative Agenda in action in your current/favourite/most wonky roleplaying group, and how to support that, than to try to figure out which of those three broad categories it fits into.

It's not "what kind person is Jason?" but "how can Jason and I both contribute to this particular game in a way that makes it do what we're looking for better". In the article you've pointed to, the implication is that all these players should be given something they enjoy all together in the same game (and that in turns implies that there's only one type of game to begin with, at least to some readers, and it's just its individual components--like "is there enough combat?"--that determine its success).<br/><br/>An argument could be made that each approach misses out on the other's strengths, of course, and I'm cool with that.

The game can suck, but he can toss out what he doesn't like and then it rocks." OK, fine. Herbie is talented. However, imagine how good he'd be if he didn't have to spend all that time culling the mechanics. (Recall here I'm talking about system, not source or story content material.) I'm suggesting a system is better insofar as, among other things, it doesn't waste Herbie's time. </blockquote>\nThis assumes that there is no benefit to customization of written material, assumes that Herbie does not enjoy this process, and assumes that source or story content material are always severable from game system.  All these assumptions fell down the stairs and, bleeding out, finally died in 1986 when GURPS came out and made a commercial success out of just those things.  There is great benefit to customization of existing material - it is, for example, easier to teach a slightly customized version of a game to a group that already knows the base material, it is much easier to hit a narrow target of taste, and it helps you understand the underlying material better.  There are many people who enjoy this customization, and I am baffled that anyone <i>here</i> of all places would argue that you can just pull the source/story content away from the system and evaluate it separately.\n<blockquote>Three player aims or outlooks have been suggested, in that a given player approaches a role-playing situation pretty much from one of them, with some, but not much, crossover possible. </blockquote>\nYeah, we've already been over this bit, but check out the very first conclusion drawn:\n<blockquote>Here I suggest that RPG system design cannot meet all three outlooks at once. For example, how long does it take to resolve a game action in real time? The simulationist accepts delay as long as it enhances accuracy; the narrativist hates delay; the gamist only accepts delay or complex methods if they can be exploited.</blockquote>\nI can't imagine three wronger statements about an attitude towards delay in adjudication.  Any of these three outlooks can be perfectly happy with delay in adjudication in certain situations, and any of these three outlooks can be pissed off and annoyed with delay in adjudication.  Speed chess is not better or worse than regular chess, it is just different, it tests different skills. "Gamists" might be pissed off at a delay ("this is a fast game, don't fuck around, make your move") or they might not ("hm, let's think about this position deeply").  "Simulationists" (defined here as "creating a pocket universe without fudging") might be annoyed at delay ("there is an obvious correct answer here, the fact that you're delaying shows me you are not inhabiting the same world as I am") or they might be enthused about it ("wow, I wonder what will happen now?")  "Narrativists", here defined as someone "satisfied if a roleplaying session results in a good story" (! - why this definition was backpedaled from later I have no idea), might appreciate delay ("this is a good pace, we can engage the rising tension") or not.  There is no other way to respond to this segment except to say that it is completely wrong in every possible way it could be wrong.<br/><br/>And because of that, what follows:\n<blockquote>One of the biggest problems I observe in RPG systems is that they often try to satisfy all three outlooks at once. The result, sadly, is a guarantee that almost any player will be irritated by some aspect of the system during play. GMs' time is then devoted, as in the Herbie example, to throwing out the aspects that don't accord for a particular group. A "good" GM becomes defined as someone who can do this well - but why not eliminate this laborious step and permit a (for example) Gamist GM to use a Gamist game, getting straight to the point? I suggest that building the system specifically to accord with one of these outlooks is the first priority of RPG design. </blockquote>\nis <i>very obviously</i> nonsense.  But I'm going to jump ahead of the conversation and rehabilitate it a little.  "Wait!" I cry.  "Okay, so clearly he was wrong about handling time and classifying it by player preferences and saying this type of player loves long handling time and this type doesn't.  BUT, JDCorley, you fool, don't you see that in demolishing this argument, you've conceded that handling time is a trait of a game that players can have aesthetic preferences on?  Didn't you just get done saying that short handling time is something some players value? Wouldn't it be preferable, then, to have game systems that have short handling times for those that like short handling times, and longer for those that like longer, and a great variety of both, so those that don't care about handling time can pursue the greatest variety of other aesthetic preferences? Isn't the broader point of the essay, that you CAN make judgments about RPG quality, in terms of whether it reaches some goal, still valid?"  To which I can only reply: "Yes, JDCorley, you have made an excellent point and are very wise.  However, this reasoning can't rescue the second half of the essay or the alleged objectivity of the quality of the RPG.  Remember, the point of this part of the essay is to respond to an imaginary interlocutor who claims that aesthetic preferences are subjective and only a 'matter of opinion'."\n<blockquote>I certainly can't dictate how much is too little or too much - but I do claim that if they are not appropriate for the player outlook of the game (Gamist, Narrativist, Simulationist), players will complain, rightly, that the system "bogs down" (Narrativist), is "unfair" (Gamist), or isn't "realistic" or "accurate" (Simulationist). A good system's resolution should get the job done in appropriate amount of real time. Which job, and how long is appropriate, depend on the outlook.</blockquote>\nRemember, that because he's completely wrong in every possible way about how these three outlooks (even as defined here) relate to handling time, he's completely wrong in every possible way about how to "objectively" evaluate games.  That's not to say a preference for or against long handling times is an invalid preference - it just doesn't elevate the quality of the game out of the subjective "opinion" of the player into some objective truth about the game.  <br/><br/>Let me give an example.  The "handling time" of Burning Empires' Duel of Wits is very significant for new players and even for old hands, they may take some time to go through it.  But this is not a bad thing about the Duel of Wits mechanic: 1) it rewards skilled play and has a great deal of strategy about it, 2) it produces unexpected and surprising fictional outcomes, and 3) it produces dramatic and engaging fictional outcomes.  Does this mean it is "objectively" good for any of the outlooks described above? Absolutely positively not.  Plenty of people in both the Narrativist and Simulationist outlooks (again, as described in this essay) can't become engaged with the story (Narr) or the world (Sim) with so much artificial structure imposed on a duel of wits.  But many in both of those outlooks would not only become engaged, they'd become more engaged than if it was "just roleplayed".  (Quite correctly, the author, quoting Everway, recognizes "just roleplaying" as a system for resolving things.)<br/><br/>So there you go. The vast majority of the examples and ideas in the essay are bad and disproven.  However, the core idea, that you can make aesthetic judgments about game systems, and that they matter a great deal to play, is absolutely true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271907/#Comment_271907" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-18T15:15:55+00:00" title="May 18, 2010  3:15PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.

"Old school" games (as defined and elaborated on <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/ebook/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming/3159558" rel="nofollow">here</a>) arguably require an emphatically more flexible approach to their mechanics.<br/>And, well, I think folks who only like the Old Skool approach and folks who don't get the Old Skool approach (like me, formerly ^_^) represent(ed) the two big camps in the SDM debate, historically. <br/><br/>Now we all know that System Matters Somewhat - Please. When I run Polaris, I insist that everybody say all the necessary Key Phrases as-written, throughout the whole game; I believe that the game is subverted if we go off the rails, since using the conflict system is a big part of determining when and how quickly individual protagonists go insane or meet a Dark Fate.<br/><br/>If mechanics are much less about the narrative arc, and more "simulative", if you will ^_^ then strict adherence to the rules reflects a strict vision of the SIS itself, which may not be to everyone's liking. But when we've all agreed to play a game with a narrative that'll have certain parts, we have to agree *as a group* to deviate from that game-as-written, given that it will then produce a different story.<br/><br/>If I modify S&amp;W's rules for dwarves, though, something tells me that the overall shape of a Tale of One Dungeon would not change significantly, especially given the nature of my modifications. <br/><br/>Does that make sense? Part of SDM is about reinforcing play *against* dynamics that we wish to avoid - in a collaborative storytelling effort, a few rules and guidelines can stop the loudest people at the table from dominating all the time, for instance. And now that we've devised the tools, the techniques and understanding, to better prevent such dynamics in our games, I think we've been served well by SDM. But no, not at all is it something universally equally applicable, except of course in the case of the Lumpley/Care-Baker Principle, which would argue that System matters because it is inescapable. <br/><br/>But that's another kettle of fish, perhaps.

Even if you take completely different assumptions (customization is good, good GMing can be a powerful tool and designing for it isn't a mistake, etc.), the idea that you can't compare games or decide that one is better than another at achieving some preference of players (including GMs) is wrong.  You absolutely can. And system absolutely does matter, even to super great GMs who customize everything.  In fact, they matter moreso to them than to fumbling noobs who don't know what they're doing.<br/><br/>I don't think the junk in SDM implies anything about current theories, good or bad. They are what they are, they stand or fall on their own.

It's not.  It's one of the considerations in action-resolution.<br/><br/>When I say action-resolution:  one of the characters in the game tries to do something.  What is the outcome of that event?  Does the character succeed?  How do we decide?<br/><br/>The simulationist input says "What is likely to happen in the world?"  A hypothetical pure simulationist has a model that mimics the physics and psychology of the world, and determines that for inputs A, B, and C, you get a certain chance of outcome D, a certain chance of outcome E, and a certain chance of outcome F.  The model might be explicit, or it might be based on gut feeling about what is likely or unlikely to happen; actual resolution might involve a GM rolling dice and consulting a table (possibly one made up on the fly), or the players reaching consensus about what is likely and reasonable to happen.<br/><br/>The dramatist input says, "What is likely to make a good story?"  A hypothetical pure dramatist has a model that considers the events in the game as part of a story arc, and considers things like rising action, conflict, escalating tension.  Again, the model might be explicit, or it might be based on gut feeling; actual resolution might involve a die roll or some other randomizer, with bonuses or penalties to steer the story shape, or it might involve consensus, or some other mechanic.<br/><br/>The gamist input says, "What is likely to make a tactical challenge for the players?"  A hypothetical pure gamist has a model of the characters' capabilities, and matches the events in the world to the characters' abilities and the players' skills so that it makes for a good game.  Again, specific mechanics might be objective or subjective.<br/><br/>I explicitly reject the usefulness of the concept of Creative Agenda linked to this model.  When you tie the three inputs into action-resolution to things outside action-resolution, you get heat rather than light, because once you do that, it obfuscates far, far more than it explains.  In fact, I watched the rec.games.frp.advocacy newsgroup degenerate into a perpetual flamewar over willful misunderstandings of what was then called the Threefold.  It *doesn't work* as a player-categorization tool, or as anything other than a model of how people decide what happens next.  It *doesn't work* when you try to use it to explain what players want out of the game overall.  It especially doesn't work when one of the three inputs is elevated over the other two -- yes, this is *Story* Games, but it's far more useful when it's treated in a value-neutral way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272987/#Comment_272987" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T11:22:06+00:00" title="May 25, 2010 11:22AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2010 11:22AM by Moreno R..">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cwilbur, you are using <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/threefold/" rel="nofollow">GDS</a> (or "<a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/threefold/" rel="nofollow">the threefold model</a>) that is very different from GNS, even if they share some terms. <br/><br/>What does it have to do with GNS, that works not on a single resolution level, but on entire instance of play (that can mean even MONTHS of play)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272995/#Comment_272995" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T11:55:14+00:00" title="May 25, 2010 11:55AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, you said a great thing that I was about to type up. Sweet!<br/><br/>Here is my stripped-down response, focusing only on an AP post to make my point (brownie pts. plz!):<br/><br/>I played <i>Radiant</i> the other day, and fundamentally, play broke down into three sections: 1) the presentation of a challenge, 2) gathering resources, and 3) tackling the challenge head-on. For each smaller obstacle embedded in the overall session, those three steps happened again and again. At the same time, we were playing <i>Radiant</i> quite deliberately - to engage with the setting material, the role of being a demigod who's thought a demon by society, and so on. But the story? Nah, there wasn't really one. There was lots of peripheral story <i>material</i> - an orphaned elephant-tamer, a drunken sea captain, a bandit and a scholar all walk into a temple. You bet there was a lot going on below the surface!<br/>But that wasn't what we focused on in play, except for purposes of color, and the game didn't offer up anything material to support us addressing our back-stories meaningfully, either. This was not a bad thing, nor is it a criticism.<br/>I would say the *Dramatist input in our game wasn't "what would make a good story?" so much as "what would be the most interesting thing to happen right now?" Rather than attempting to Say Something through our game (and it could have gone differently, true), we tried to devise the most exciting responses to the challenges presented to us. I could very well have spent more time trying to get my sea captain to bond with the orphan, and we could have spent time building a little family on the fly, in the midst of crisis.<br/>But really, the emotional depth ("serious" feelings, that is) of our game was quite thin - we weren't playing to pathos (or bathos) at all. We stuck with rock 'em, occasionally sock 'em, combat and acrobatics and sweet martial arts moves.

ago, about someone (possibly Ron) putting together a book fulla Big Model theory essays. That has yet to materialize, obviously.<br/>I fear that, aside from a few dozen bloggers giving BM 101 lessons occasionally (not Vincent, etc., but rather random enthusiasts like myself), there IS no big, codified set of ideas for you to find, Veles.<br/>I'm scratching my head with you, actually - I just try to play new games to keep up with new theory, and have resigned myself to the fact that, after the Forge shut down, <i>I don't know where the discussions continued.</i> No clue! Yeah, Vincent's blog, okay, but since I haven't encountered any sort of Big Theory Announcement posts or whatever, I can only assume that there isn't a lot of consensus on any major new ideas anyone's presented. <br/>That's one Forgie's opinion, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273159/#Comment_273159" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T11:54:04+00:00" title="May 26, 2010 11:54AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the links, I'll start looking through them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273201/#Comment_273201" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T14:22:22+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  2:22PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The theory discussions at the Forge are going on as usual.

That's one thing I think is interesting. Another is the question I actually asked: would all of them see the same color of play?<br/><br/>Likewise, I suspect no one in set two would see anything other than "yellow", "purple" or "orange". And would all of them see the same color? And what would their reaction to the observations of set one be? And is it possible that what set two sees as "definitely yellow" strikes set one as "well, they were sort of trying for green play, but failed, making the whole thing incoherent"?<br/><br/>As for set three, suppose all six of the colors were explained to them after they made their observations. Would their natural response be monochromatic? That is, would they say play was definitely one of the colors? Or would they say something like "sometimes it was green, sometimes it was purple?" If you forced them at gunpoint to pick one of the colors, would they all pick the same one?<br/><br/>Also of interest to me: what color would the gaming group itself say it was playing? Would they all agree? If they don't, what does that mean about the opinions of the observers? And, if some observers think they "failed" at reaching a pure color, does the group itself perceive that failure? And if they do, how much do they care?<br/><br/>In other words, I'm sort of wondering how much the notion of "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail" applies to "game theory" discussions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274098/#Comment_274098" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T13:13:00+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  1:13PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2010 1:14PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think theory asserts that we can get some use out of looking at everything as nails, so yeah, let's wield this hammer.<br/><br/>I think the problematic part is keeping track of what the "nail" perspective is good for, and what it's not good for.<br/><br/>If you're not committed to wielding a hammer in the first place, you're probably not going to get mileage out of nail-vision.  If the theory says "red <i>or</i> blue" and you say "reddish blue", you're not using the theory.<br/><br/>Hopefully, your gamers are simultaneously red in one theoretical paradigm, yellow in another, and a rainbow in a third, and all three groups of observers can agree within their group and compare notes with the other groups amicably.  "Looking at it as Red shows this!"  "Ah, interesting!  Well, looking at it as Yellow shows this!"<br/><br/>If each group can't agree internally (red or blue? yellow or purple? rainbow or polka dots?), then either they're not skilled at using hammers, or the hammers they're using are shitty.<br/><br/>It appears that GNS is either a shitty hammer or a hammer that takes a high level of extremely specialized skill to use.<br/><br/>(I love analogies!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274116/#Comment_274116" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T14:42:07+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  2:42PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>My question is this: to what degree is it possible that<i>different</i>people observing the<i>same</i>group play over time will reach different conclusions about what agenda that group is even pursuing?</blockquote>\nWhat I think:<br/><br/>1) To some degree you have to know what you're looking for.  Much like you need a therapist to diagnosis PTSD but even someone without training can point at the signs even if they don't know what they add up to.<br/><br/>2) Even people who know what they're looking for might disagree from time to time.  Not every therapist will diagnosis PTSD 100% in the same person.<br/><br/>3) However, over time I believe the majority of observers will trend towards the same set of observations.
