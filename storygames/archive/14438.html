Hopefully it'll also make me reply to some of the other discussions as well, instead of just reading them. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nSo, on to the topic at hand. Project Dreamland is a role-playing game I've been working on with a good friend of mine for about two years now, and now we're looking for playtesters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What Is Project Dreamland?</b><br/>\nIt's a game of pulpy conspiracy theories, in the vein of things like Conspiracy Theory, The Arrival, The X Files, and to an extent, Men in Black. The players will be playing characters who set out to discover the true nature behind Project Dreamland, a world-spanning cosnpiracy about which nobody knows anything for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What's the Gimmick?</b><br/>\nQuite simply, when the game begins, nobody knows what Project Dreamland really is - and that includes the GM. During the game, the players create rumours, representing rumours that their characters know about - perhaps something they read in a tabloid or something they overheard in a bar. Those rumours are put in The Welter of Rumours, a large bowl that sits at the centre of the table. The GM may pull rumours out of that bowl in order to determine whether they are actually true or false, without the players knowing what he decides.<br/>\nThe players then portray their characters as they are trying to uncover the truth - and not get killed in the process.<br/>\nThe exact state of the rumours, how they are removed from The Welter and other issues are all governed by the game mechanics, allowing the GM some control over the eventual fate of the rumours, but not full control.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Are There Other Mechanics?</b><br/>\nSure, the mechanics don't only concern the rumours. The game flow is governed by mechanics of scenes, which give the game a unique structure and pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>How Long Is the Game?</b><br/>\nThe game is designed for mini campaigns of roughly 6-12 sessions. It does not work for one-shots.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What Are We Looking For?</b><br/>\nWe want people who could play the game for several sessions, preferably to completion, and give us opinions based on those sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of this looks interesting and exciting to you, send me an email: michpev AT gmail DOT com. I'll be more than happy to send you a playtest copy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
