This means low threshold of participation, clear results, ability to influence the matter perhaps, interesting developments and so on and so forth. It can be creator-originated by having the creator court people and gather his own patrons/audience as we've already seen done now and then (there's that guy with the blog who designs in private but lets his patrons into the process or something like that, right?), or it can be started by the patronly motivated, who then direct their pecuniary power towards philantropy pleasing to them: those designers they want to support.<br/><br/>It would be pretty rad if somebody started an association or foundation or what-do-you-call-it where the whole idea were for the participants to patronize roleplaying by their own donations and arranging collection drives. Sort of like the Lions Club for geeks. In fact, somebody take the Lions Club recipe and refocus the culture into a gamer/artist/hipster thing while turning the philantropy towards gaming, and I'll be there like the wind.<br/><br/>Giving out minor grants wouldn't be so sexy, but it would be quite the rush if you could get enough pecuniary power into it to be able to pay somebody a monthly grant, for example. Then the foundation members could make a call for design papers and pick a promising designer to patronize. Perhaps have them report on their progress monthly to keep some overview on the project, and end the grant when the game's finished and published. This is such an obvious model that I'm actually pretty sure that it's been speculated about before somewhere.<br/><br/>Ultimately the difficulty is that this is no easier than traditional publishing in many ways: while you don't need to market the product to the public, you still need to market it to the patrons. This gets a bit easier with a long-term foundation that develops contacts and prestige among the patronly inclined (I'd say "among the elite", but in the future patronizing shouldn't be the prerogative of the rich and the powerful) and routine in money-raising, but it's still basically just as much a full-time job as publishing is. The artist to be patronized can do the work, but then he's not out there working on his design. Or you can have somebody else do it, but then that guy has to donate his work, or he has to be paid, eating into the efficiency of the system. I imagine that this is the main reason for why we don't have this sort of thing going on already in gaming - this is such a cottage industry that you could get people to jump for ridiculously small sums of money compared to other arts, so if it wasn't so much work to set this up, it would have already been done.<br/><br/>Still, if one were to start a fund and situate it culturally as a money bin to put money into when you feel bad about your piracy, I could see that having legs. It just needs absolutely impeccable organization and lofty goals to make it seem the worthy operation that it is. Wouldn't hurt to have some fund-raising dinners or something, too.<br/><br/>For the record, I'm totally on boat if somebody wants to patronize me. One rich patron or a bunch of small fry, makes no difference. I'll make you a character in my next game <i>Eleanor's Dream</i>, in fact, for the right price. Heck, for the <i>right</i> price it can be <i>Christopher's Dream</i> or something, what do I care.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285820/#Comment_285820" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T10:48:57+00:00" title="August 12, 2010 10:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, another awesome approach might be to offer x amount of your time a year towards what ever project fans could get the most support towards. So, fans get together and decide man we really want to see this kind of game/supplement lets start getting people together to get on board. A system would then be in place where fans can make a public proposal and then others can sign up for e-mail notifications and pledge an amount they would be willing to donate when the time came. Their job is then to chat up the idea and try and rally more support behind it until say fall.<br/><br/>Fall e-mails go out and let people know that the "polls" are about to open. Back at the public proposal that the groups made the creator places paypal donation links keyed to each proposal and allows people to donate until a few days before the max amount of time to give a full refund without fees. Which ever proposal raises the most money gets its initial funding, and all other proposals shoot refunds back to the losing folks. The designer then devoits the pre set time over the course of the year to produce the winning product.<br/><br/>I am sure you could word that better but my break is almost over so meh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285827/#Comment_285827" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T10:58:12+00:00" title="August 12, 2010 10:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2010 11:00AM by mease19.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about a publication co-op with a collective "tip jar".  Different designers could pool their efforts to get their games to market, sell yearly game bundles, and profit share.  <br/><br/>I think I like the idea of buying stocks better than pure patronage.  What if players purchased "stock" in the form of a gift card from a designer.  The designer gets the money now to invest in game design and publication and, at a later date, that card could be redeemed in merchandise.  When a designer announces they are working on a new game, they could make a public stock offer to collect money for that game's design and perhaps make those shareholders eligible for personalized copies of that specific game. You could then buy stock and gift it to others and/or trade it for stock in other designers.  Designers could even hold shareholders meetings (meetups really) at conventions; being a shareholder would guarantee access to your designer, sneak peaks, playtest sessions, etc.  Buying multiple shares could give you greater rewards as you are basically pre-ordering multiple copies in advance; game stores might be willing to buy multiple shares of a hot offering to get copies early for their store. Games could also give a list of shareholders in the credits, in the same way that some games give a list of playtesters, who purchased stock at the initial announcement to fund the project.

Speaking personally, I know that money isn't the main thing preventing me from finishing games and I suspect that, for many designers, the issue is time (since they have full-time jobs and families and the like), which is something that money can only sometimes help with, when it replaces the need for working additional hours on something to make ends meet.<br/><br/>I know Elizabeth got that $1000 grant to work on Blowback and that was really helpful for her, so there is definitely places where money can help, but I imagine that they are on a designer-by-designer basis.

You can print exactly the number of copies that people pre-order, if you've priced everything right.  Maybe it could hold true for printing out your initial 50 copies to take to a convention, but that's kinda a different thing.<br/><br/>Maybe we should just ask people: what costs are preventing you from making progress on developing your game?  For me the answer is "none" but I can't speak for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285953/#Comment_285953" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T15:40:23+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  3:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2010 7:07AM by Seth Drebitko.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>You know, I'm wondering what problem this idea is trying to solve.

I've been hyper-conscious of the need to pay it forward ever since. Same with the DivNull Lark and my transparency blog. Plus I'm going to do layout for a new female designer's first game for free, and I'm helping another get their text into shape.<br/><br/>I guess my point is, the community here is incredibly, profoundly generous to people who give back generously. There are lots of ways to do patronage, including support that isn't specifically financial\u2014 offering help that would normally cost the person a lot of money is something that happens fairly often around here. While money is a big barrier to a lot of folks, I think that Jonathan's right and there are larger barriers that could perhaps be solved with a different kind of patronage. (Not that I can write Jonathan's grad papers on religion in China for him so he can finish Geiger Counter, but you get the idea.)<br/><br/>I've watched a friend's kid so they could finally get some writing done. People have sat down and given me an incredibly valuable crash-course in document structure. I know this isn't strictly what the OP was talking about, but if the idea is to support people in their artistic pursuits, it's something to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286057/#Comment_286057" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T09:29:48+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  9:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't read everyone's posts, so forgive me if this has been said, but doesn't <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.koboldquarterly.com/k/faq" rel="nofollow">Open Design</a> do this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286066/#Comment_286066" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T09:58:43+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  9:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

In the US, this would probably require some kind of registered charity organization in order for the tax stuff to make any sense. I looked into this (very) briefly when the first DivNull Lark started, and came to the conclusion that such an organization really doesn't make sense until you start getting into around $50k in "endowment". I could be mistaken, though.<br/><br/>I'm going to see my dad in Vegas over the weekend. At various points in his life, he was a lawyer (past president of the Colorado Bar Association) and ran an organization that dealt with a lot of donated money and endowment management (the Denver Center for the Performing Arts). I'll pick his brain about the place where law, charity and patronage meet.<br/><br/>Anyone have any specific questions along these lines?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
