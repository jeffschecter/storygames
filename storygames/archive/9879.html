It perhaps deserves more discussion. I've certainly been thinking about rules that are perhaps necessary, but should not be used constantly, like 'veto' rules in games with a heavy storytelling component (like Dogs or Archipelago).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219524/#Comment_219524" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T05:47:37+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  5:47AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That really is fascinating.<br/><br/>In Vampire LARPs, the social rules are much more important than the written rules.

And how some people won't play in some games against certain set-ups, like in Warmachine, playing against 30 Bane Knights, or in Magic, playing against a deck that wins when you say "Go" and you don't get to do anything at all.<br/><br/>In tournaments, you accept it, but when playing for "fun" (whatever that is), you give them a pass, since it's just not fun.<br/>A voluntary and self-imposed <a href="http://competitiverpgs.wordpress.com/2008/06/21/competitive-games-and-handicaps" rel="nofollow">handicapping</a>. The fail happens when people are either new and don't yet know the social rules, which is why people originally messaged Twixt, they thought he just didn't know. It also fails when there are people who are playing to win, competitively all-out, and they are unwilling to accept handicaps.<br/><br/>In such cases, you could say that there's a clash, and majority usually wins in games where "Interaction" is required. Technically, I would side with the person playing by the rules, it's not even like it's an open-game where everything is possible, this is a game with specific mechanics, the mechanics are combat-oriented, so is it surprising someone goes with what the mechanics reward and enable? We know that's not so.<br/>But realistically, it's also a social game, and you can't play without paying your social dues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219533/#Comment_219533" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T06:29:00+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  6:29AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 6:30AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.<br/><br/>Yeah, the dude was a 'griefer.'

I mean, the professor says "If you aren't a member of the tribe, you get whacked with a stick. I look at social groups with dismay," in the last line of the article, in a sort of "Tut tut, whatever happened to tolerance and acceptance?" sort of attitude.<br/><br/>But this isn't just wearing a provocative T-shirt. This is the cultural equivalent of punching people in the face and stealing their shit. Sure, it's not permanent damage, but it's clearly doing things designed to significantly inconvenience them. Yeah, people are going to react harshly to that. News flash, alert the presses and scientific community: people don't like assholes.<br/><br/>Although, it is interesting (I don't play CoH/CoV myself) that evidently, nobody uses the PvP areas to, well, actually PvP. <i>That's</i> something worth looking into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219539/#Comment_219539" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T06:59:12+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  6:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 7:01AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lehman, I actually prefer his <a href="http://www.alwaysblack.com/?p=250" rel="nofollow">WoW</a> article in this context (though what you linked was powerful too).<br/><br/>Not only on the "Cheating aspect", which isn't cheating per se, but on his stance on "If you don't have to group, and if you don't group, then it's not really an MMO". This dovetails nicely into the theory discussions we have, about having mechanics for what we want to see (there's partying mechanics) and not having mechanics for what we don't want to see (making it impossible to progress solo?).<br/><br/>Interesting, regarding "Twinking", what if a real friend of yours gave you help? Or you partied with them and they helped you through. That's in a way very much the same, but it also meets the MMO social aspect, and what we see in a lot of fiction: One mentor character guiding a lot of first-levelers about, essentially.<br/><br/>The "Cheating" is on one level on the social level, of what's "Accepted", but who decides what's accepted and how? And what if 90% of the players accept this practice? I think in a sense he'd still consider it cheating, but then it'd move from the social level to the ethic of "I did it on my own". No help from people who aren't on par with you, no using things that aren't on your power level unless you came by them "Squarely", which also means, "Squarely with <i>this</i> character" when we unpack it.<br/>Which is not unquestionable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219540/#Comment_219540" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T06:59:32+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  6:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 7:00AM by lachek.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminded me of "Playing to Win" by David Sirlin, available here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.sirlin.net/ptw" rel="nofollow">http://www.sirlin.net/ptw</a><br/><br/>And in finding that link, I also noted that - of course - Mr. Sirlin has blogged about this particular incident here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.sirlin.net/blog/2009/7/7/dr-house-and-the-professor-who-played-to-win.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sirlin.net/blog/2009/7/7/dr-house-and-the-professor-who-played-to-win.html</a><br/><br/>It's my opinion that any game which, when you play by the rules and use only legal moves, allows one player to consistently out-do others, is a well and thoroughly broken game. In a table-top setting with only a few face-to-face players, this could be mitigated by clearly delineated expectations (i.e. "house rules" or "social contract"), which act as a "patch" on the code base. In any kind of open, organized play such as, let's say, the Camarilla LARP organization or Living Forgotten Realms, such rules should also be made openly available and <b>official</b>, not presented as a "guideline" for acceptable behaviour.<br/><br/>In case of CoH/CoV, no patch to the code, official and enforceable codes-of-behaviour, or even guidelines from NCsoft have been published. In their absence, I can only assume that Myers is playing the game "right", and the others are playing the game "wrong". Imagine if you walked into a LFR game, ready to slay some orcs, only to find the DM literally making deals with the players to make all the loot and XP in the dungeon made available at practically no effort, through having the monsters act friendly to you and give you all their stuff? And when you decided to play the game as intended and bashed the orc leader's head in, everyone got furious with you and tried to have you ejected from the RPGA because now you've ruined their plans to just stand there and power up their characters?<br/><br/>If Myers has found an exploit which is deemed illegal by NCsoft, they should fix their game, not rely on the community to develop unofficial house rules enforceable only by abuse and ostracism. In fact, a reasonable fix to this issue, which would make the game non-broken, is a statement from NCsoft that "we only provide a sandbox for people to play in - it is up to the community to build rules surrounding its use and up to each individual to learn the unspoken rules if they want to be successful and popular". Much like "Rule 0" in 90's RPGs, this would make the game "not broken" by definition - just, not complete and coherent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219542/#Comment_219542" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T07:00:18+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  7:00AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 7:02AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Sure, Bret, but define "exploiting" or "twist". He was just using the rules.<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>Well, here's the thing. In games like this there are things that are within the rules that aren't intended by the designers (or we can suppose, but it's generally kind of obvious and sometimes the developers will even say, "Yeah, this is a problem") that the designers can't fix or haven't had a chance to fix. It sounds like what he was doing was walking through one of these gaps. Generally what's done in this case is social leverage is used to try to get the party to stop. Kill-stealing is a good example since it's a problem in a lot of MMOs. You wack on a monster until it's down to almost no hit points, someone else walks in and lands the killing blow and they get credit for it and access to the loot. It's within the rules, but not considered good sportsmanship.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I played City of Heroes, but I am pretty sure I know what he was doing. He was basically teleporting villains into areas with super-powerful and nigh-unkillable hostile NPCs. He didn't get credit for the kill. There was no reward to him or any other hero. The only thing that was happening was the villain was dying and as a result the player was having to deal with the pretty steep penalties that City of Heroes imposes for death (which when I last played was a sort of experience point debt that you had to dig your way out of in order to contiue to level). He wasn't playing to win. It's more accurate that he was playing to punish the players of villains.<br/><br/>I'm not making any judgments here. Just saying that when it comes to competitive multiplayer games there are often holes in the design that people can step through until the developers patch it and correct it (if you're lucky). Without any other recourse, players will try to lean on the exploiting player, sometimes very uh vigorously.<br/><br/>And like I said, I think there are tabletop analogues and the same sort of thing happens. Some tables try popcorn throwing to stop the player from doing this, others will have deep out of game talks about it, others will try to deal with it in-game. Sometimes the player will end up being ejected if none of the former methods work. But imagine if you're stuck with a player in a game who is abusing the rules, you've talked to him about how it's ruining other people's fun, and he says "I'm just playing by the rules," and continues to do so and you have no way of ejecting him.

Certainly there's a disconnect between the designers' idea of what is acceptable and what the fan base think is acceptable. The more complicated answer is that "by the rules" necessarily includes the rules added onto the game by the players. In a social environment, which CoH/CoV is indeed, the rules include the social norms. Myers was being a dick.

That player knows that their behavior causes problems and upsets people, and is unwilling to change that behavior. The unwillingness to change upsetting behavior can itself be griefer behavior.<br/><br/>However, not all upsetting behavior is grief in the technical sense of "griefer." If the social norm on City of Heroes was that PvP was fine and expected, then Myers' "Twixt" character wouldn't be causing grief by killing other characters, even if those character deaths upset their players.

They're multiplayer, similar to COH, but a different style of gameplay and innately competitive in ways that COH isn't. But I think one key thing is the ability for individuals to host their own servers where they can enforce their desired norms which is something that you cannot do with COH or other MMORPGs. A lot of the time you'll see common rules across many different servers as the players enforce what they feel is a gap in the games rules.<br/><br/>Many Team Fortress 2 servers have rules against spawn camping. Spawn camping is a tactic where you stand around where the opposing team's players will respawn into the game and kill them the moment they respawn. In competitive play it's considered a valid tactic but it drives most people nuts as it barely gives them a chance to fight before they're killed. The Team Fortress 2 developers resolved this by setting up the game so that teams spawn inside of an enclosed area that the enemy team can't enter, but they can still stand outside the door and kill opponents as they exit. So it still drives some people nuts.<br/><br/>Anyway, what is a solution on TF2 (set up your own server or find one that shares your norms) is impossible in an MMO as you can't host private servers and they're managed by the company. It's like being forced to play a tabletop game with any person who decides to wander in and sit down. Nature of the beast, it seems like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219552/#Comment_219552" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T07:48:02+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  7:48AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 7:58AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, merely a more careful look at the claim that you've made, that "By the rules" also necessiates the social norms.

When someone comes into the area for the first time, gets told the rules and accepts them, he didn't just affirm the current usage, but he makes it so himself. The original players could then move on and he'd keep it upheld.<br/><br/>And when someone comes like Myers, he's negotiating the Social Contract, and even if there's a tear between him and the rest of the community, we see "Who gets to decide how the rules/area is used." It is used as a non-adversarial area by population X, and as an adversarial area by population Y. Social Contract doesn't require us to agree, that's just an ideal, there could be a power-play between different groups.<br/><br/>Of course, the designers sometimes have room, or a GM, or whatever, as an embodiment of "Control". If the area was changed, so PvP combat was no longer possible, then you'd know who gets to decide how it'd be used: Everyone. The coders would just get to decide a certain parameter in which it can't be used, in this instance. I'm sure someone could just aggro monsters, run around to the weak opponents and then vanish and let them suffer.<br/><br/>Everyone negotiates and re-negotiates social contract all the time, especially in such a setting, because as Bret noted, everyone can just walk in. So they get a say, whether by agreeing, disagreeing, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219571/#Comment_219571" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T09:12:31+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  9:12AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are multiple issues here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the professor may be focusing on the issues that fit his agenda while ignoring the issues that would detract from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe found a loophole to instant kill opponents. I\u2019m not sure if the loop hole has been fixed yet but I know that City of Heroes developers were at least intending on fixing it at some point. Not only was it a loop hole, but it was one that didn\u2019t benefit him. He didn\u2019t improve his ranking or gain any in game awards. He didn\u2019t challenge himself. It can be a lot of fun to find and exploit loopholes but he kept doing it again and again to the point where there was no challenge. Nor did he gain any social rewards. He became an outcast. He might have been doing it to gain personal pleasure but he admits to being shocked and even afraid of the consequences of his actions. Ultimately he was acting in a way that didn\u2019t make sense for the game (system wise, rule wise, social wise) because he had an agenda outside of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately City of Heroes should have fixed the loophole. But when a system can\u2019t be quickly patched, people usually step in and use social pressure to correct the problem. But sometimes the loophole is so powerful, social pressure isn\u2019t enough to change things. And customers quit playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be ranked in the top 300 in the world in Smackdown vs. Raw online. I\u2019ve played every version. And saw similar behavior again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnline play quickly became unfun. Out of the thousands of moves available it would often take less than 1 month after a new edition of the game came out before people found all the loopholes. Unblockable moves. Moves that could be chained to infinity. Or ways to keep running away from your opponent till they grew so tired of waiting for you they would quit. New editions would fix the problems. But editions were at least 1 year apart. 3 months into a new edition interest would severely drop.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny enough, people abusing the rules this way weren\u2019t even the major problem. People using 3rd party tools to actually hack the rules tended to be rampant. For example, you can make it so that you simply can\u2019t be hurt by your opponent. And in comparison people who would abuse loopholes would point to hackers and say\u2026 \u201cat least I\u2019m not that bad!\u201d But it still made the game quickly unplayable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s not that different than certain definitions of ethics. People can get away with using a loophole because not everyone does it. Like cheating on your taxes. But one way to test what is ethical is to see what would happen if everyone did it. If the system can\u2019t continue to function with everyone cheating on their taxes, it\u2019s likely unethical and something needs to change. Some of this reminds me of our recent problems with abusing loopholes in the stock market and credit markets. Once everyone does it\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, there are other interesting issues to explore. Like how systems evolve in use beyond their original intent. Using competitive modes as methods of trade or socializing. But even with these evolutions, there were still areas where PvP was going on. And his observations seem to be ignoring his potentially unethical behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s interesting!

Having played a little CoH in my time, and kept up on the game casually, I'm pretty sure that socializing with players on the opposing team can be done completely without risk in Pocket D (A "nightclub" zone that prohibits power use, and is open to both Heroes and Villains). Choosing to socialize in a PvP zone is a telling and nonsensical choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the particular method he was using is pretty cheap, and I am quite surprised the game masters didn't warn him off of it. If he was not concentrating unduly on one particular villain, his behavior couldn't be considered harassment, but the Terms of Service do prohibit exploiting loopholes to make the game perform in ways not intended by the designers. I'm pretty sure that using the NPC "Guards" to kill his enemies constitutes such behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he's simply better at using his character's abilities to deal damage and prevent/reduce damage than anyone he attacked or who attacked him, then his behavior may be dickish, but it's within bounds of what you can and should expect in a PvP zone. His refusal to stop when, as he wrote, it became un-fun, and when people (on both sides of the Hero/Villain divide) asked with varying degrees of politeness for him to knock it off definitely push it into dickish territory. The fact that it was for research doesn't in any way prevent it from being rude, crude and socially unacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis conclusion was... something I could have told him up front. Normally rational, polite people get enraged when you fuck with their funtime. I used to rant at the top of my voice whenever some PK would waste me in Ultima Online. I would type some pretty foul things into the local channel as I watched them ratfuck my corpse. Granted, curse words aren't precisely uncommon in my vocabulary, but I like to think I'm pretty reasonable and friendly most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n(incidentally, I do not find his behavior problematic; Those pissant PKs in UO were a big part of why the game really worked well, and once they created whole PvP-free zones, that game quickly became a shadow of its former self)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219586/#Comment_219586" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T10:17:50+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 10:17AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I'll note that, according to players on the server, people were PVPing in the PVP zone. They were just chatting as they did so, and PVPing in a way that was in keeping with the game's reward mechanics.</blockquote>\nFrom what I've seen on the subject so far it sounds like the concern is grounded in the fact that Myers was playing according to the explicit but <i>fictional</i> intent of the zone - killing the other team. The fact that the actual <i>mechanics</i> of the system doesn't reward Myers' behaviour is the problem. It sounds like we are, in fact, dealing with a classic example of incoherent game design, where the reward system triggers for completely opposite or at least orthogonal actions than what the fiction suggests it should. No wonder there is strife - when people enter the zone, they are forced to pick between competing creative agendas. Engage in PvP supported by the reward system, which has a low payout on both in-game and out-of-game rewards? Or engage in PvP with methods supported by the game, but outside the norms of the player base, which yields a high payout on out-of-game rewards (the sense of "winning" in accordance with the zone's stated purpose)? Or purposely not engage in PvP, rather completely contradicting the zone's stated purpose for a high payout of purely in-game rewards (loot from NPC mobs)?<br><br>As for whether Myers' behaviour was "unethical" or not, take a look at EVE Online for a good study on that. People have run scams in and out of game to amass wealth and power, and doing so is a major aspect of gameplay. In the context of the game, this behaviour is exactly what CCP (the developer) is going for - their game is attempting to simulate a hyper-capitalist universe where nobody can be trusted and people will do anything for ISK (money). You cannot possibly call that behaviour unethical, although it may be unexpected and outside of societal norms. The moment the scams are taken out-of-game, the line becomes blurred. CCP looks away when things like that happen, figuring (correctly, IMHO) that they cannot hope to control what goes on after a player has logged off their servers - at that point, they are subject to local laws, not CCP's. Yet this sort of behaviour might potentially be called unethical, or even illegal. But as to what happens in-game? I can't fathom how anyone could call that unethical and not comment on the ethics of the developer, whose responsibility it ultimately is to determine what is and is not okay to do in their game. To draw a parallel with tabletop RPGs, NCsoft is not WotC - NCsoft is WotC, the DM, and the game's host, all at once.<br><br>If "griefing" is the act of making someone feel grief, and a "griefer" is a person who habitually engages in "griefing", then it's a meaningless term. It is <i>I</i> who construct the grief, not the person "griefing" me. In my many years of playing MMOs, a particular action by another player may alternately cause grief, excitement, terror, anger, elation, amusement, frustration, and a whole series of other emotions. Which particular emotion depends on who I am, how I feel today, what else happened to me that day, who is the catalyst for the emotion, who else is with me, where I'm playing, what game and zone I'm playing in, how much time I have, what I did previously in the game, what my losses or gains were, etc etc. As for concrete examples, I've felt amused, frustrated, upset with myself, and excited when shot down outside a space station in EVE Online with a freighter full of cargo (which was all lost, and took days to get back), but I've felt bitter and angry at my attacked when killed in Age of Conan despite losing exactly nothing in the process. Conversely, there was a time where I was killed in Age of Conan by a guy much, much stronger than me, and I was overjoyed at the opportunity to repeatedly play hide &amp; seek with him despite my low chance of success.<br><br>Suffice to say, "griefing" is 100% subjective and useless as a term. I've spoken with so-called "griefers" in person and found them to be perfectly reasonable people with very legitimate reasons behind what they are doing, usually revolving around "winning the game". And man, if there's one thing I can't stand it's playing a game with people who aren't playing to win.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219591/#Comment_219591" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T10:37:27+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 10:37AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What griefing is, isn't really subjective. It's based on knowledge of reactions to your behavior, and the will to do it anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what you're doing is likely (or more concretely *intended*) to cause grief, then you are a griefer. You are taking your amusement from the destruction of other people's fun. That's a pretty concrete definition, and a lot of the time, it's pretty concrete that people are doing so, and on purpose, by how they respond to their 'victims'. If the guy you're attacking tells you to knock it off, and you do it anyway, you're griefing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDude in the original article had every evidence that what he was doing wasn't considered a fun challenge by his targets. He continued to do so. It's fairly cut and dried. The only complicating factor is that he wasn't doing it for fun, but for research. He had a valid reason for doing so, but he was still a dick for doing so. The people taking part in his 'experiment' weren't volunteers. They did not sign on for dealing with his fun-crashing behavior for the sake of science. They were not paying for the privilege of being his research subjects. Hence, his higher reasons were immaterial, and quite possibly scientifically unethical, depending on how you squint at that issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219594/#Comment_219594" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T10:42:11+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 10:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 10:53AM by lachek.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In summary of the above, taken into tabletop territory:<br><br>If, in (insert typical hack&amp;slash fantasy RPG here):\n<ul>\n<li>a Thief is a class which is underpowered in combat</li>\n<li>individual XP is used</li>\n<li>the game features rules for stealing, which Thieves are particularly good at</li>\n<li>XP is provided for Thieves as they acquire gold</li>\n<li>Thieves are limited to alignments which are typically associated with untrustworthiness and lack of honour</li>\n</ul>\nthen the implicit reward system for Thieves involve stealing gold from other PCs, and this behaviour is to be expected.

The definition doesn't change depending on who's viewing it. The usage is consistent with the definition in most cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can call the bright color of (American) stop signs green, but that doesn't mean it's not actually red.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe definition is even less vague and subject to interpretation when any other reward is reduced or absent. Myers wasn't getting XP for the Villains he teleported into range to be killed by the NPC robots. PKs who killed me on the road from Britain could have gotten far better loot and far more gold playing PvE. PvPers who wanted a challenge didn't ambush newbies clad in a mishmash of looted armor and clothing. Myer's purpose was to gauge the results of what happened when he played counter to social convention, but with the support of the 'rules'. Hence, his research (substituting for fun) was gained from the destruction of others' fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't say the line can't be thin, and hard to define from the outside. Here's a short story of something that happened to me... I was playing UO. For whatever reason, my character had gone 'gray' (meaning he'd committed a criminal act) even though I hadn't done so, to my knowledge. Glitches happen. Anyhow, this fellow attacked me. I lead him a merry chase, through moongates and across the country side. Sometimes I fought back and once or twice I had him on the ropes, and gave chase with righteous indignation, and other times I fled whilst bandaging the hell out of myself, and hurling invectives at my attacker. Eventually, he took me down, and he's rooting through my belongings as I'm berating him within an inch of his life. He engages me in conversation, noticing that I am calling him a PK and other things, acting like I'm the victim, which I was. When he realized I hadn't done anything to hurt anyone and earn my gray status, he resurrected me, healed me, and returned my belongings. We kept up a casual friendship thereafter. While what he did looked like griefing from my vantage point, I say that it may not be, because he believed I was in the wrong, and that he was in the right. His actions after the fact, making up for the 'grief' he caused, lead me to believe that maybe he didn't intend to cause grief.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could indeed, with a small stretch, call the tidal wave of crap that Myers brought down on himself griefing. It's a stretch because of the usage of the term, which almost exclusively refers to a type of game play, and because intent is harder to gauge from knee-jerk reactions born in frustration and anger. The dudes that talked about him on forums, tried to have him banned from the game, etc. is a bit more clear, and I wouldn't feel uncomfortable with it called griefing. They were trying to revisit on him what he did to them, but that doesn't change the basis of their intent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>To join the digression of EVE:</b> I love those very factors. I want a game that does what EVE does that doesn't primarily involve flying around in spaceships. While I hated the time I had someone lock on to me in the middle of a interstellar trip, and blow me to space dust before my sensors could even pick him up, I loved that thrill of going through .4 space, scrolling the camera all around looking for threats, my finger hovering over the button to jump me to a random planet should I see anything to worry me. It's the same thing about old UO that I loved. Getting killed by a PK was a real pain in the ass. Escaping a PK by the suede on my leather breeches, through judicious, skillful and lucky use of tactics, terrain and character ability brought a real feeling of accomplishment. Authorizing my guildies to form a 'posse' to go troll the haunts of known PKs to kill them and collect the bounty was done with a certain gleeful sense of righteousness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not the play atmosphere of EVE that failed to keep me, or the casual:serious divide. It's the color, and the gameplay (PvE eventually seemed too slow; I suspect PvP would seem too fast) and the sense of vast loneliness and isolation. If you were orbiting a space station, you were usually completely and utterly alone.

And according to Sirlin's article linked in Mikael's post (#11), he also managed to win the zone much more commonly than others did, which is an in-game goal.<br><br>Edited: Because it might seem like I'm skipping on the mechanics vs. non-mechanics line, I'm not.<br>His goal was originated in an in-character reasoning, heck, it came from within the game's world and fiction. He wasn't stopped by the other layer of the game, the mechanics. The argument against him to stop came from the meta-layer, of the players playing the game.<br>I'm not saying one is more important than the other, and I think most people who call him griefer are only halfway there.<br><br>Sure, he could be seen as a griefer, but what? Ending it at that is both simplistic and unhelpful, the thing to do is look not only at why there was a clash, but how the clash could be avoided and fixed. That's what we're discussing it on an RPG forum with design tendencies for, aren't we?<br>And simply kicking him out is simple, probably works, but should also be a goal of last resort.<br><br>The issue Myers identifies is a real issue, one we know of, and calling him a griefer is a bit weird in that sense, and I may liken it to what a "White hat Hacker" supposedly does. He points out the discrepancy between the game as stated, to how the game plays. Having the mechanics enforce the game's goals is only one side of the equation, the other was tried and failed by the players who reported Myers: Social Contract Mechanics. Reporting him for "Underhanded techniques" is a form of social contract mechanics, enforced by admins/mods.<br><br/>In a way, what Myers did was also a form of Social Contract Mechanics: In PvP zones, you are permitted to do harm to characters of opposing factions. By entering this area, you submit that you are willing to take the risk of this happening to you. And Myers simply carried out his half. Being able to attack other players is a mechanical aspect of the game. Should one be able, and should one do it, are Social Contract issues, and thus, these rules are Social Contract Mechanics. Whether they enable or disallow PvP, in certain zones, on certain servers.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219623/#Comment_219623" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T12:36:43+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 12:36PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a social scientist myself, I take issue with the way that this guy hides this passtime behind a very thin veneer of "science".<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was not a scientific study.

On Second Life, the online community with which I'm most familiar, there are groups of griefers, with pretty open mission statements: to wreck the fun of other players. They gain status within their sub-communities by doing the most damage to the SL community.<br/>Most griefers aren't that organised. <br/>The definition is clear-cut, but of course there are edge-cases. Myers looks like one of them. In my opinion, he deliberately chose to be griefer (without thinking of it in those terms), to observe and document the reactions to this behaviour.<br/><br/>If I did that, and wasn't writing a paper about it, it's clear-cut. I'm a dick. If he does it, he gets to write a paper about it - but he's probably still a dick:<br/>Most psychological sociological experiments (these days!) are careful about the psychological impact they have on the experimental subjects, and also get some sort of consent. He didn't do either of those (very much the reverse, in fact) - so there's an argument that, even in his day job as a professor, he acted unethically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219630/#Comment_219630" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T13:01:57+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  1:01PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 1:05PM by Lord_Minx.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>As for EVE Online, I'm bothered by what I read happening there. People join an organization, when they belong to a group who wants to see its downfall, and then keep playing inside for months of real-life time, till they get the power to dismantle it and/or send all of its gold to their own original faction.<br/><br/>Yes, they get major "cred" and satisfaction, but so many players get damaged, their fun, the many real life hours' effort of mining asteroids, etc. I think that's why the game is so tiny, not because of "griefing", but because playing casually is a dead-end. You play casually, choose a faction to align with, and then get curb-stomped by politics you couldn't care less. And you stop playing, so almost all the players left are those both willing to engage in such practices, and who seem to enjoy them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Edit to add: You're right that the game is tiny because you cannot play it casually. It is not a casual game. The people who play it play it<i>because</i>of the factors you dislike. There's an undercurrent of MMO players who actually do prefer world-wide PvP, permadeath and backstabbing.</blockquote>Ehm, I really feel I gotta correct a few things about EVE here:<br/><br/>1. One can (and many do) play EVE casually or without PvP. In fact, I'm doing exactly that: I play a carebear miner in a carebear guild. I log on, at themost, a few hours a week, generally to participate in the corp-organized mining or mission ops. (Which reminds me, gotta switch some skills.) I have been killed by another player exactly once, and that was when I explicitly went out to low-sec space to see if we could find some PvP.<br/><br/>2. EVE isn't really "PVP, all the time". Well, it technically is, in that you can (try to) kill another player everywhere. Practically, though, the game is split in "high-sec" and "low-sec" space. In the latter, more or less anything goes, but in the former, attacking another player will lead to the attacker being killed by Concord, the ingame NPC "police", which cuts down on most PvP. (High-Sec isn't "safe", because you can skill be attacked and killed if somebody cares enough or you make mistakes. But all in all, high-sec space is pretty secure as far as EVE goes.)<br/><br/>3. While the big heists and feuds are the things that make the news, I'd wager that for 90% of EVE's population, life there is much more peacefull and non-treacherous then one might think. Sure, there are the wars out there, and if you like that, I hear they are pretty cool. But even so, I haven't fired a gun at another players character in ages and I still have fun. And I'm not alone, the carebears are out there and we are legion. ^_^<br/><br/>So, yeah, EVE can be a hostile game. And yes, the general attitude dev-side and in the player base is very different from other games (which is one of the reason I like it) but, as with anything else, one shouldn't just read the news and think the whole game is like that.

I'm generalizing. The specific setup of EVE does allow for non-PvP play (although the typical definition of "PvE" is a misnomer - the game is grounded on PvP, even if not everyone engages in it, so that is still what fuels gameplay on all levels), and this is an integral part of the game's mechanics. The important distinction is that there are no meta-game policies surrounding safe zones in EVE - if you can figure out a way to attack a peaceful trader or miner in high-sec space, it's a perfectly legitimate move. Thus, there is no game-assisted "griefing", as this implies out-of-game motivated harassment: every action you do is considered In-Character, and can be easily interpreted by all players as such. In other words, if your pod is shot down and you forgot to update your clone, it's your own damn fault - not the attacker's, and not the game's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219644/#Comment_219644" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T13:44:41+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  1:44PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't speak for anyone else, but I bear no particular animosity toward this fellow. I'm simply a vehement arguer. I think what he did was dickery. I think it falls pretty squarely into grief-play. I think (having not yet read the study, but about to) that the conclusions mentioned in the original article do not require much more than common sense to deduce, and that the dismay he displayed is pretty naive, and based on a shallow concept for the effect of what he's doing. If he had somehow managed to set the experiment up in reverse, where he was on the inside of the community against the griefer, that his findings would be vastly different. But there's no anger toward him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the game that CoH/CoV was when I left, it would have been relatively easy to avoid this type of play, so I don't feel that his 'victims' were helpless before his onslaught. He also didn't descend into the depths that grief-play can go to, taunting and ridiculing your fallen foe, frequently in a manner comparable to the threats he was getting. My general, very non-specific approval of the effects of player-killing/grief-play are moot in CoH, because it is by and large a care-bear game, with clearly defined PvP zones, and clearly defined rules on who can attack who, even in those zones. Hence, to be a victim, you have to tacitly opt in. This makes me shrug my shoulders at the complaints of those victims. If I knew the fellow, I'd probably say "dude, you're being a dick." and move on. Being a dick doesn't necessarily mean you're a bad person, and it doesn't even imply that you're always a dick. I do find it hard to believe that people who make it their primary source of entertainment to ruin the fun of others, and to belittle and degrade them when they have no solid way of seeking reparation, could possibly be decent people, though. In this case, he doesn't appear to go to that extreme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219647/#Comment_219647" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T13:52:30+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  1:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Thus, there is no game-assisted "griefing", as this implies out-of-game motivated harassment: every action you do is considered In-Character, and can be easily interpreted by all players as such.</blockquote>Hmmm, dunno about that, really.<br><br>For one, the ingame-outgame distinction in EVE is ... strange. While there are people that behave in ways that more closely align with what MMOs would call "incharacter play", I think the average EVE gamer is very much outgame most of the time, even though the resulting behavior "blends" into the ingame setting.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Okay, I don't think that makes any sense to somebody not me. The way I see it, EVE is a game where OOC and IC match or "overlap" to such an extent that the distiction becomes, if not completely moot, then at least much less clear then in other games. For that alone, something like "every action you do is considered In-Character" isn't something I'd agree with. Shooting somebody to pieces for profit or fun aligns with both the fictional setting ("It's a dangerous universe") and the outgame "way it's meant to be played" as designed by CCP, but I don't think most EVE players would say "Ok, that's just the way I play my character".<br/><br/>Also, even in a game like EVE, there are griefers and while similar behavior might be more accepted in EVE then in other games, that doesn't mean most people don't consider them huge assholes. But, as with the ingame/outgame thing, this is much less clearcut. For example, there the suicide gank: Killing somebody in high-sec (And be killed by concord for it) can be done for a variety of reasons: Profit (you or, IIRC, somebody in your corp/fleet, can later loot the wreck) is one, but there are also people who just like to fuck with carebears.

"do", I think. When I play EVE, I'm still pretty much me and I don't really try to conciously rationalize peoples actions as ingame.<br/><br/>That said, I think I totally get where you're coming from. This harks back to the weird blend that is ingame/outgame in EVE and it's one of the great things about the game, IMO. EVE is a game where the ingame and the outgame overlap to such an extent that the difference becomes pretty unimportant. (Or at least it can become so.) Ultimately, it doesn't really matter if the pirate is pirating because he plays a pirate character, because the player thinks it's a goodway to make money or if it's just the player enjoying some easy PvP, because the end result is the same: Somebody somewhere is getting podded and looted. ^_^<br/><br/>In this light, griefing only goes away if you accept that it's only griefing if there are clearly identifiable outgame reasons. Something I, personally, don't, because intention is hard enough to establish in the real-world, never mind a massively multiplayer game where, short of telepathy, there is no functional difference for an outsider between a griefer and somebody just "playing an asshole".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219660/#Comment_219660" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T14:34:23+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  2:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EVE Digression: When some nearly nameless, faceless stranger podkills you, he's a dick. There's no benefit for him. He doesn't know you, and thereby has no particular animosity toward you. This is true whether you do it with in-game rationale (oh, my pilot's a psychopath!) or not. EVE is interesting in that it's the only game I know of where you can be killed in almost all ways that matter (you lose your ship, money, and any cargo you were carrying) but still not go all the way. Podkilling someone is specifically saying that you want to set them back if you're able. Disrupting their trip and taking their stuff isn't enough, you want to take their recent advancement if at all possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the matter at hand: I've read the meat of the article. One thing that strikes me is the way he refers to the actions of Twixt as thought those actions were not his. I wouldn't be surprised if this was simply an academic affectation, but it seems like he's trying to distance himself from the actions of his fictional character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think I understand the basic flaw in his whole premise: He looks at the game rules as rules for behavior. This is wrong. The game rules are like the laws of physics. They determine what's <i>possible</i>, with no judgment of what <b>should</b> actually happen. Yes, there is reward, but it's the same type of reward given by basic natural laws. If I am stronger than you, I can take your stuff. If I take your stuff, I am rewarded by having more stuff. The laws of physics inform social rules, by giving them a framework in which to grow. You can't have a social rule against killing people if it's not possible to kill people. The people playing the game have determined that certain things are the 'right' way to play, completely separate from what those who created the physics might have allowed for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, his dismay at the harshness of the reactions seems slightly disingenuous. He'd been playing the game for at least two years. It's quite likely he's been involved in non-academic internet culture as well. Because of this, I find it difficult to believe that he's not aware of the boldness offered by anonymity, especially when he took advantage of that same boldness to conduct this experiment. If such a concentrated campaign of doing things to break societal rules were perpetuated in the physical world, where people come within strangling distance, it's likely that the possibility of physical violence would have stopped him at a much earlier point, even without overt threats. Additionally, another concern I would expect he would be aware of is the level of expressive hyperbole necessitated by text-based communications.. Specifically, the fact that black and white cannot transmit emotional context, so to get a point across, you exaggerate. If you're mad, you don't just say "I'm mad." You say "I'm furious! I'm enraged!" If you're angry enough to be shouting at your computer while sitting there in your living room, it's quite possible that a death threat seems the most reasonable way to express your emotional state.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219662/#Comment_219662" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T14:44:20+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  2:44PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading his paper... on one hand, he seems to be playing from the perspective of "well my guy would do this in the fiction". In the fiction, he is a hero so he most stop the villains. So heroes and villains hanging out was against his suspension of disbelief.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in other instances, groups of heroes and villains would gather and have a representative from each side fight each other while the others watched. Which seems fitting from a fictional perspective. But even in these cases, he would join in and just start attacking the people watching the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some cases he is doing what is right for the fiction in his eyes. In other cases he is following the letter of the rules while conveniently ignoring the intent of the rules. In other cases he isn't even optimally playing the letter of the rules as he doesn't benefit game wise from killing opponents the way he did because it doesn't count as kills for him. He isn't playing for fun. He isn't playing for a challenge. He doesn't even seem to get joy out of beating other people. And he isn't playing with people who want to play the way he does (he had many people to choose from). His actions seem a bit inconsistent.

What about a soccer tournament? I'd disagree.<br><br>The relevance is about whether a game has additional rules to those which constitute it. A constituent rule is simple, if you remove or change such a rule, you're no longer playing that game. So long as you abide by all such rules, you are playing that game.<br><br>That's part of what makes a game a game. Real life is important, we could say it's more important than the game, but it's not relevant to what makes up the game's rules. You could say I'm turning it around, and while saying your point is valid about behaviour between people, who happen to be engaged in a game, it is completely irrelevant and orthogonal to the point of the game itself.<br>Myers treated the game's rules as physical laws. And inside the game, that's exactly what they are.<br><br>They are the rules for actions, they are the rules for behaviour. Inside the game.<br>What you're pointing out is that this discussion has two layers, as I keep pointing out.<br>Myers' error is <b>not</b> that he didn't follow the rules for behaviour inside the game, but that the game is <i>inside</i> something else, the social environment of our real-world. The disconnect is that the rules of behaviour inside the game tend to lose to the rules of behaviour inside the real world.<br><br>That's a good way in which we decide how competitive a player is. Say playing Diplomacy, or Settlers of Cattan, how willing they are to renege on deals, backstab their real-life friends to win the game. Even though the game is created with that expectation in mind.<br>Heck, the real decision you make in many of these games is not "Will I backstab my friend/cousin?" but "When will I backstab my friend/cousin?"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219672/#Comment_219672" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T15:04:21+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  3:04PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 3:04PM by jenskot.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>A few quibbles with your main arguments though: He does benefit, it seems.

                 The difference between any of those games is that you've got two 'teams' coming together where winning and having fun are the only goals, and then they move apart. Two soccer teams, two chess players do not make a society. You do not have social rules growing out of the events of a single instance of soccer that affect conduct within that instance. It's too limited in scope. A soccer tournament is a bit different. There will be social rules that grow out of the tournament, most especially if it's a tournament with extensive interaction besides the sub-components of the tournament (the games), such as you'd find at the Olympics.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that the game is inside the social context of our world is... well, it's useless. It's obvious. The social rules he's poking at exist <i>inside</i> the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nRules for behavior. I think we may be using different meanings of the term. Physical laws are what you can do. Social rules are what you *should* do, and what you *shouldn't* do. He followed the physical laws of the game, because he cannot help but do so. He deliberately chose not to follow the social rules of the game, but he did this in part because he believed that there were two sets of social rules. Social rules are not created from outside the society. They cannot be. Social rules exist within the social group, and are formed by the social group. Sometimes, frequently even, those social rules will be nearly identical to physical laws. "Possession is 9/10ths of the Law", for example. If you physically possess it, it's a good chance that it's yours. But this is a choice made by the members of the social group, not mandated by the powers that be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlright ya'll.

They were just chatting as they did so, and PVPing in a way that was in keeping with the game's reward mechanics.</blockquote>According to Myers' full paper, the RV zone (PvP zone) was full of highly profitable, farmable NPCs, so long as you DIDN'T actually engage in PvP. So the Heroes and Villains didn't fight each other, nor did they bother to capture the objectives to win the battle, but just farmed for XPs (Influence).<br><br>So, NOW who's "not playing by the rules" or "breaking the social contract"? Let's see if Agenda can help:<br>* Step On Up. CLEARLY a major component of MMOG PvP. Was anyone stepping up? Nope... just farming loot to be leet.<br><br>* Right To Dream. I'm a HERO. He's a VILLAIN. We're playing in a (basically) Golden Age of Comics MMOG. And all the "heroes" and "villains" are standing around chatting while they spawn-cycle NPCs?! I'll concede that it's "in-fiction" to have superhero and -villain groups stand around and watch a duel, to decide... something "in-fiction." But wait, what's in-fiction in this situation? Does the duel winner get to, then, win the zone for his side unmolested? If the villains lose, is it acceptable "in-fiction" for them to cackle and launch into PvP anyway, mocking the heroes for believing they'd keep their word?<br><br>* Story Now. The PvP zone has a narrative framework which involves controlling pillboxes so that the Whoosaframmer can be Bondiggled and, thus, a side "wins"... for now. Yep, not MUCH of a Situation, and the Heroes v Villains / Good v Evil isn't much Premise... but it's utterly ignored by standing there farming while saying, "Good mornin', Ralph"... and "Good mornin', Sam" to your bitter enemy.<br><br/>So it's a LOT like if I went to play a soccer match (since we MUST use an analogy) and instead stood in the middle of the field having my picture taken by my sponsors off-field, as I strike various awesome soccer move poses. What? I get paid a LOT more to be photoed by my sponsors than to actually play a game! I'm the "team star" that everyone's come to see, and here I am for my fans. Fine, fine, they want to see me PLAY? OK, I set up some little scrums whereby I dribble past three defenders and then score with an impossibly curving shot past the keeper. STILL not good enough? Why not? I'm playing soccer, against a team; hell, even outnumbered, so I'm showing extreme prowess. Just because my teammates are all in on it, setting me up to look totally awesome (I give them 20% of my gross from sponsor checks).<br/><br/>Think it never could happen By The Rules, even though at no time do I or my team mates actually break a rule... even as our opponents do all kinds of rule-breaking, like screaming obscenities at me and doing hard tackles and even getting a few of my disgruntled team mates to make intentional errors while also mocking me? Think that can't happen? (Notice I've ALSO integrated how Twixt's enemies DID break all SORTS of EULA rules and, mostly, got away with it!)<br/><br/>OK, then go read about how Wilt Chamberlain got his 100 point game. By the start of the second half, he was being fed with every ball, by his "team" and only by doing so (and being a Bad Ass in the quadruple-team!) did he set that record which will never be beaten without a similar feeding of a similar demigod. All the while being hard fouled so much his coach was in a livid rage--i.e. even the REFs had issues with Wilt being fed, and looked the other way too much (according to one side's view).<br/><br/>In summary, I'm with Twixt. He engaged the Dream, he stepped on Up, and he advanced the Story (such as it is) by routinely winning the zone for Truth, Justice, and the Good Guys. The farmers and pacifist duelists, for their part, exploited the competitive quality of the game zone (i.e. NPC rewards were HIGH because the designers presumed there would be constant competitive pressure making them hard to defeat as a "sub-goal"), ignored the Dream of G v E, and didn't do a thing to advance the Story of "who controls the zone and saves... or destroys... the city?" And broke the shit out of the EULA and even, it could be argued, some laws against public harassment and verbal assault (which, yes, are WAY behind the times, vis a vis the Internet).<br/><br/>But, hell, everybody KNOWS I'm a griefer, just out to shake up the boring social conventions that make everyone sheep. :P                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219893/#Comment_219893" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:56:46+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:56PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 1:58PM by lachek.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, well said.<br/><br/>As I see it, the counter-argument (to follow along with your analogy) is that soccer is <i>not</i> what the rules say anymore - due to pressures from the players and spectators alike, it has turned into a faux show not unlike, say, pro wrestling. By that argument, the emergent game play is no longer things like "kick the ball into the net", but "engage in social power play to become the next Wilt Chamberlain" or "accumulate as much wealth as possible through sponsorship deals so you can fund a charity and go on Oprah". Training no longer revolves around running fast, kicking hard and accurately, or knowing good tactics, but rather immersing yourself in the culture and playing status games.<br/><br/>In reality, there's a finer line - being a good and successful soccer player means being a <i>team</i> player, with all what that entails. If you are a dick to your team on the field, your team will perform worse. If you can't listen to your coach's instructions, you won't get ahead. These are valid emergent play properties, but to call them equivalent to the culture of mob-grinding which apparently went on in the PvP zones is surely a stretch. As I've said before, I'd sum this up as a clear case of poor game design and expectation management on part of NCsoft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219895/#Comment_219895" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T14:00:44+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  2:00PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were even close to being the case that he did it for those reasons, I could sympathize.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn't.

He probably would have left the duelers alone, and wouldn't have hammered the farmers often enough to be more than a nuisance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really.. I'm letting myself get caught up in the specifics. What happened there is past. The motivations and the dickery of it are moot.

Nobody has ever described the conditioned Pavlovian reward cycle of "pull lever, get cookie" as "fun" outside of the context of video games, and I for one think the lack of critical thinking on this issue is sorely lacking. This is one of the reasons people are moving away from talking about "fun" in video games, and talk instead about concepts like "flow" and "immersion" which can be more easily observed objectively (and can be more consistently exploited for profit).<br/><br/>If I'm habitually paying for and smoking crack, is that proof that I'm having fun?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>If this guy had visited a lost tribe in Outer Somewhere and violated all of their mores (but none of their laws), he would scarcely be lauded for his academic mien.

I agree he'd likely be strung up, though.

Yet, if the social contract for the zone had been made explicit, he would no longer have been able to argue he was just following the rules, since "the rules" would explicitly include the social contract.<br/><br/>The problematic question here is, how could this be managed? In a user-driven game like MUSHs or Play-by-Forum, there would be specific people with zone control (i.e. zone builders/owners, forum managers/GMs) who should be responsible for explicating the norms for their zone. In organized play efforts like the RPGA, there might be a body of people who centrally manage expectations by providing ever-changing rule sets, training GMs, and so on, based on community input. But in top-heavy games like large-sized MMOs, who would decide when a particular set of norms - made evident through emergent play - should become integrated into the rule set or otherwise made official?<br/><br/>The benefits of such a process should be evident, though - imagine being an NCsoft operations manager and getting the request to change the rules for the PvP zone such that PvP is disallowed in favour of mob farming? I'd believe the club would come down pretty hard in <i>opposition</i> to such a request, which would also serve to "fix" the zone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220067/#Comment_220067" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T07:45:35+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  7:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, explicit is not enough.

An explicit agreement is only needed when you get into contexts where social contracts and agendas might differ radically, like an MMO filled with casual players, hardcore players, role-players, kids, and so on.<br/><br/>I claim that a board game where a simple one-liner regarding social contact is not sufficient to inform everyone how the game should be played is incoherent, and playing such a board game and disliking it in many circumstances is to be expected, as with any poorly designed game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220075/#Comment_220075" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T08:01:54+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  8:01AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Social Contract implies "law", to me.

If you are a dick to your team on the field, your team will perform worse. If you can't listen to your coach's instructions, you won't get ahead. These are valid emergent play properties, but to call them equivalent to the culture of mob-grinding which apparently went on in the PvP zones is surely a stretch. As I've said before, I'd sum this up as a clear case of poor game design and expectation management on part of NCsoft.</blockquote>I shoulda stayed away from analogies. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I was attempting reductio ad absurdum, and didn't reductio enough. Fair enough. I'll just stick with the points I made before the soccer analogy. So "being a good team player" might be a BIG part of the CoH PvP element, no? But at what scale, with what goal?<br/>* A "team player" who respected the long "goal" of maxing Influence and slots tweaking would not engage in PvP--he'd farm or leave.<br/>* A "team player" who respected the diegetic, short "goal" of winning the zone for their side would not only maximize their effectiveness in PvP but would also, like, help each other (recall the "Good" team players asking for Confuse from Villain "enemies" so that they could target their "team mate" Twixt?).<br/><br/>So it comes down to... what's the Point of Play, on every scale and time frame? Is it the (gamist) goal of Be Leet so others stand in awe and envy of your stats and level? Mebbe so. And since PvP almost NEVER aides that directly, due to developers knowing the virtuous spiral inherent in that (WOW's recent changes making a notable exception), OF COURSE you shouldn't engage in PvP; it shouldn't even be in the game, right? (Obviously, I'm WAY on the other side of this issue.)<br/><br/>Or suppose the Point of Play is the (simulationist) goal of Being There and Doing That Super Hero Thang RIGHT. Then, standing around farming in PvP--hell, cooperating with Your Enemies at ALL--is the utter no-no.<br/><br/>(I strain to find Theme in this situation--God and Evil battle eternally, so we might as well get off the Karma Cycle and get Phat?--so I abjure.)<br/><br/>So, basically, it's going to come down to the Intent of Play (i.e. what's the game designed to enable) and being able to engage that Intent. Otherwise, you've got "mere" popularity driving the Point of Play, not the design or the designer's Intent. Some say, "Fine! Up the People!" others say, "BS, man--you farmers are spoiling my Dream!" so who do we turn to, if we want this impasse resolved by something other than mob rule?<br/><br/>The designers. What did they say? *crickets* I take that as tacit approval--they wanted their PvP zone to be a CONFLICT, and they (mistakenly) put a few NPC subgoals in there that were very lucrative, if you could keep from being ganked while you took them down. Emergent result: "the only way to win is not to play," to quote my favorite AI.<br/><br/>NCsoft could fix this EASY: nerf the NPC awards so that there's a better place than the PvP zone to farm. Deal with the howling outrage of affronted lazy people. Return the PvP zone to one it was intended to be: a site of battle and conflict, not chat and cooperation.<br/>-----<br/><b>Myers the character vs Myers the person</b><br/>I think we are in a good position to actually comprehend his duality. Him, as a real person, probably ISN'T much of a dick--he seems highly aware of social convention, he's clearly articulate, and he's even a bit funny. Maybe he doesn't like social pressuring (he didn't say "society," he said he didn't like that technique for achieving conformity--who here thinks threats of physical violence and using verbal abuse to shout down a deviant is OK? Show of hands, plz.).<br/><br/>But Myer the CHARACTER, the persona he was portraying to conduct his study, was just a guy who was, like, "WTF, dudes? We're trying to win the zone, ya? Go, Team GOOD!" Maybe a doofus, with no awareness that the farmers have a "right" to ignore the PvP (boy is THAT a good new thread!). Maybe a deviant, "griefing" the nice folks who just want to ignore the designer's intent and max out their paper doll. He got accused of being a child, a sociopath, and autistic.<br/><br/>But he was a scientist, trying to use a known Real World technique to see if it worked in MMOGs, and found out that, man, it works with a VENGEANCE. Like, works better than actual Laws against how he was treated for deviating or non-conforming! (In my state, saying, "I will find your home and kill you" is assault. Repeated verbal harassment using interstate telecommunications is, last I checked, a Federal violation. Ascribing false statements about a person via same line of communications into a media format is libel, though the "personhood" of an online character is  some doubt--I am not my toon; but none of his assailants was actually decrying the *character Twixt*, were they?)<br/>----------<br/><b>Blame, 'cause someone's GOTTA be wrong, or we're merely discussing interesting design quandaries</b><br/>1) NCsoft, for not making a smart choice vis a vis NPC rewards.<br/>2) NCsoft for not immediately rectifying their systems (the NPC rewards, maybe even the TP Kill itself, so that it can't pull someone into the aggro range of "InstaDeath Bots") so that their Intent (PvP, the Dream, and now "balance") was reinforced.<br/>3) The farmers, for putting (I feel) empty, numerical gains ahead of using a whole new element of system (PvP) for making a higher-fidelity world (Good v. Evil matters, always).<br/>4) Prior design, which has made PvP already so carebear and irrelevant to the game world that it lacks any real risk/reward element (i.e. no one would be farming if a TP Kill wiped your character permanently... and PvP zone design would be a LOT more thought-out, because of that risk and the backlash that is likely if an unbalanced or min-max, rote method always won).<br/>5) Twixt... not Myers, but the "character" he was being, to do his work.<br/>6) Myers, for running it into the ground, once he had sufficient evidence that, yep, folks will curb-stomp you if you deviate from their cushy, easy, and ultimately meaningless (in a Step On Up sense) procedures for playing their game. I suspect his "academic rigor" would have been satisfied with, say, a week in each zone... not hundreds of kills over years.<br/>7) NCsoft, for not jumping down the throats of folks verbally harassing Twixt, in violation of the EULA and (arguably) local and Federal laws, using their servers.<br/><br/>But, as I said, that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220130/#Comment_220130" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T11:13:10+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 11:13AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (CRAP, I'm long-winded!)<br/><br/>----------<br/><b>Social Contract: The Cure-All</b><br/>About all I got for this is: what Social Contract?

You slide into and out of social contracts all the time depending on what you want to do in game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case there is an implied social contract.  The players in this area were engaged in Right to Dream which emphasized system and character building.  They ignored the superhero vs supervillain battles (a part of the exploration base to the game) and instead focused on whatever it took to build the systematic representation of their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMyers came in and ignored the prevalent agenda and focused on Step on Up.  He showed his skill and ability with strategy and tactics in a way that couldnt be beat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe intentionally set off an agenda clash and faced the social consequences of ostracism and threats.  He could have easily persued his step on up solo in a pve area but he went into an area where the groups had drifted play in a fashion that didnt really match the rules of the game or the area but they had made it work for themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220189/#Comment_220189" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T14:32:50+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  2:32PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting flip of Creative Agendas there, Vernon.

Like in Victorian England when some things were "just not done, old boy".  Laws and Mores are separate and figures like Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham show that violating one to cleave to the other generally makes you a love/hate kinda guy depending on the balance of respect these aspects have in the eyes of the masses.<br/><br/>My point about Outer Somewhere (which is literate and basically like Athens in Ancient Greese [the musical, not the country]) is forged to point out that a researcher who did this same thing in a realspace culture somewhere would be flagged as basely unethical.  I have seen tell of a number of researchers using WoW, etc to research economic trends, etc as a kind of field lab where there are supposedly "no consequences", but where people still make serious and informed economic choices.  This is toying with people's efforts in a way that, while it will seldom have real-world consequences, cannot be said to have no ill-effect on the unknowing subject.  It is an imposition most people would feel violated by, just like those dumb psych experiments you find out about only after something goes very, very wrong.<br/><br/>In the end, when you conduct a grant-funded (I assume) experiment to test something a 12 year old can tell you from simple inference, you have wasted time and dollars that could be used to cure baldness or Cancer.

Same as if they say, "The people of X don't want Y!", or if you get told, "If you go by X, then it's Z, if you go by Y, it's still Z."*<br/><br/>-All these things can be true, but they're notations that one should be very careful.<br/>That's, as I tried to stress above, is actually a bug with Social Contracts. Since for say, 80% of the stuff, it's both implicit and shared, we think the other 20% which is still implicit is also shared, but it isn't. And then you do X, which you think is within the SC, and someone tells you that it's not in <i>their</i> SC.<br/>It's kinda like SIS, and how sometimes what you think is there, isn't.

The games that change considerably from table to table in unpredictable ways are games that are either broken, or purposely written to appeal to an audience with widely disparate tastes and ideas of what the game "should" be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220470/#Comment_220470" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T17:56:21+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  5:56PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be careful with the tail-end of your argument Mikael.<br/><br/>Some players would drift all games the same direction.

For example, if I knew the universe had been designed as an experiment in economics, where the purpose of its agents is to get as rich as possible and thereby testing a particular economic principle, I'd feel far less concerned about pollution, labour issues, overconsumption, and so on - the point is to get rich, right? Everything else is secondary to that goal.<br/>But in a world without a clearly identified purpose or goal, we have to set our own goals. Ethical principles of the modern world assure us that these goals must be set such that they benefit or at least doesn't interfere with those of others'.<br/>"Games" which honestly <i>are</i> imagined worlds - MUSHs, forum play, most role-playing games - share this quality; set your own goals of play, but ensure they mesh with the expectations of others'. MMORPGs _seem_ to be imagined worlds, yet they are really games with world-like qualities - they have implicit goals, and it seems very hard to question those who'd choose to follow those goals over constructing a meta-layer of imaginary goals on top of the perfectly valid pre-existing game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220482/#Comment_220482" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T18:56:09+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  6:56PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, the world the researcher came to had a clearly identified purpose and goal and the playerbase just ignored it.

Especially once he started poking the hornets nest with a stick. The stated goal of the paper was to explore the boundaries of acceptable behavior by intentionally and widely deviating from normal behavior. In other words, figure out what pisses off the players and go do that over and over. Disregarding any "for the good of science" justification, this is dickish behavior (almost by definition, right?).<br/><br/>He played the game for a while before becoming a researcher. As far as I can tell from the brief history in his paper, he got along with people then and understood and abided by the social expectations of the community. That is, any urges to be a teleporting twunt were checked by his not wanting people to think he was a dick. <br/><br/>To everyone else on the game, he was just some other player being a dick. But he wasn't. Even the other sociopath-wannabe players who copycatted his style and methods didn't go as far as he did. His behavior was, seemingly, unprecedented in the history of City of Heroes. In other words, I don't think real people act like that very often. Just "sociopathic" personas invented by sociology researchers. No, I'm not really saying that Myers-as-researcher isn't also a real person. I'm saying that the antisocial teleporting behavior doesn't seem to have been a huuuuuge problem for NCsoft until Science got interested in it.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>Realize that Myers was looking for outlier behavior. He was looking to do something that violated social rules. That is, he wanted people to think he was a dick. That was the essence of his method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220570/#Comment_220570" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T08:16:29+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  8:16AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2009 8:17AM by JDCorley.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually kinda think he was, by being a dick, more of a player than the dweebs sitting around yacking in the place meant for fighting.

I will try to answer but I wanted to give you context for my answers first. I would give extra attention trying to help the students not doing their homework for a short period of time to determine why this was happening and then move forward with several wide ranging options outlined by the school depending on the causes. If this continues unsolved, additional teachers or aids can be brought in to handle the groups separately with the goal of reuniting them later on so the students doing their homework don\u2019t end up getting an unfair amount of attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m not a professor but many of my friends are (of sociology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy). And they were the ones who brought up the issue of informed consent with me. In their schools they usually include some sort of mention of informed consent in their paper. Even if it is just a reference. But I\u2019m not speaking from my own personal experience. I know that the school in question has a process of waivers you can apply for if your study meets specific criteria approved by the school.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220637/#Comment_220637" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T13:46:15+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  1:46PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2009 1:47PM by jenskot.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy, regarding:<br/>\n<br/>\nthe design is, "Attack those in the area", if that wasn't the design, he couldn't attack them<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t believe it is that simple (which is the main point I was trying to make). Take for example, a chat feature. If the designers program in a chat feature, they can try to filter out certain language but there is very little they can do programmatically to stop certain abuses. Just because the chat feature doesn\u2019t programmatically have a hard way to stop you from typing something that might be considered harassment, doesn\u2019t mean that the designers intended the feature to be used that way. That\u2019s why they include soft rules, like codes of conduct, to cover situations they can\u2019t design hard rules for or for situations they couldn\u2019t foresee. The use of loopholes to gain unfair advantages are prohibited in CoH\u2019s code of conduct. And eventually they patched the loophole twixt was using. I don\u2019t have a problem that twixt was participating in PvP in a PvP zone. But there are issues with how and why he was participating. Just because the hard design didn\u2019t prohibit his specific actions (not PvP in general but his specific PvP actions), doesn\u2019t mean they fall within the designs intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220641/#Comment_220641" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T13:58:17+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  1:58PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, I think that's an important point that got kinda covered.<br><br>I think most of those who say Myers was in the right, say he was right in spite of using a loophole.<br>I think most of those who say Myers was in the wrong, say he was in the wrong for breaking or subverting the Social Contract.

With the persistent use of the loophole and thus breaking the code of conduct, I would lean towards saying Myers was wrong. But that's been covered well, so let's take the loophole out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking the loophole out, Myers was attacking people in PvP zones that were chatting instead of attacking people who wanted to play PvP. He had people to play with that would enjoy PvP but went after people who didn't want to engage in PvP at that time. In this situation, I would lean towards saying Myers was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let's take that out as well. Let's say the PvP zones only consisted of people who didn't want to play PvP. Myers was playing with the PvP zones original purpose by attacking people. While everyone else was playing by the PvPs new unofficial purpose. But we still have the problem that Myers isn't actually interested in PvP. He wants PvP because no one else does so he can write a paper about it. So I again lean towards saying Myers was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's take that out as well. Let's say Myers really did want to play PvP and didn't have an ulterior agenda. I still don't approve of Myers actions. But I greatly empathize with him in this situation. He is paying money for an advertised feature that doesn't do what's been advertised. Because of this, I would blame CoH. They could easily create a non-PvP chat zone. Or get rid of PvP altogether. If no one is using it except for Myers, why have it? Why are they selling a feature that really doesn't exist? That still doesn't justify Myers behavior. But CoH should refund his money or appease him in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately to talk about playing by the rules vs. playing with others in a more objective fashion, I would have to drastically change the situation in several key ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say 5 of us are playing Monopoly with a house rule (very common, it's one of the most house ruled boardgames). And we invite over a 6th player and tell them beforehand that we have implemented this house rule. Now say that 6th player hates the house rule, decides to play anyway, fails to convince everyone to not use the house rule, and then ignores the house rule altogether and pisses everyone off. I would blame the situation on the 6th player. That's not saying the house rule is a good rule. But they knew what they were getting into. And rules only have power if we agree to give them power. So if the group at large changes the rules, those are the new rules. If the 6th player throws a fit and ruins everyone's fun, in my opinion then they are being a jerk. They can go play with another group that doesn't use that house rule. Now there are situations where the tyranny of the majority can be an ugly thing. But as long as the majority doesn't impede the minority's right to play how they want with other people who also want to play that way, I don't see the problem. What am I missing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220658/#Comment_220658" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T15:34:29+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  3:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it'd change anyone's opinions, and that's exactly the point.<br><br>The point is that 99% of the people would judge Myers to be X (depending on their stance), and that judgment will not change if they factor the loophole or not.<br>To pin the judgment on the loophole, to say that this is what had brought forth the specific value-judgment is obfuscatory, but I don't mean this necessarily as an attack of malicious intent, but rather, that people should do what you just did, and they'd see that this "loophole issue" has very little bearing on what they think of Myers' behaviour.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220686/#Comment_220686" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T21:56:15+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  9:56PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2009 9:59PM by JuddG.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>If the creator of W&amp;W designed it to be a monster-killing simulator;<br>and if my friends drifted it until it played like a romance novel;<br>and I joined their game, playing it as a monster-killing simulator;<br>then I am wrong, period?</br></br></br></blockquote>\nWhen a group assembles to play, and form norms, a new recruit either has to conform to the SC or change it.  Once the play has begun, the designer and his intent get booted to the curb and the group does the whole forming/storming/norming thing.

In college, one of my pals was in the Chess Club.  He was an excellent player.  He wanted the club to encourage new players to try the game.  Consequently, he played at handicaps, forced himself to only play a few moves ahead, or explained his thinking aloud as he played to better aid the other player.  The rules of chess stand mute on this stuff, but the SC was clear - good players who are playing rookies need to play them to help in learning - not to win and chase people away.  Chess, in the way it was played, changed.<br/><br/>Another example to show the opposite end of this spectrum was a person I heard rumor of at a friend's school who would play Go with people and mercilessly cream them and gloat over the board at them.  Another player specifically mastered the game to a very high level with the sole desire to hand this guy his ass and send him packing - because he was ruining the game for people.  Go changed.<br/><br/>All of this, I hope illustrates that I am not talking at all about the Rules (or laws) of the game.  I am talking about, and Twixt ran afoul of, the body politic of its players.  He went into a culture and he violated their mores.  They redressed him and he offered back that the game designers allow it to happen (which is something I am sure few of them argued against).  It wasn't about what was possible, or what made sense, it was about what the group consensus held was fair.  It would be like a man jumping in the first rescue boat in a naval evacuation and explaining to the women and children that nothing in the seat's design prevented him from doing it.

If you treat a single instance of chess as "the game", then it's not big enough to form social rules. The same thing is true of a soccer game. But if you treat a chess club or soccer league as "the game", then you've got both persistence and variability. Social rules can form that may modify the way the individual instances of the game are played, without actually breaking any rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nHence, "chess doesn't change". The game itself doesn't. The larger communities that form around an activity can, and very frequently do change the way it's played without necessarily changing it's rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220737/#Comment_220737" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T15:57:23+00:00" title="July 25, 2009  3:57PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the teleport attack wasn't broken none of this would have been a problem. <br><br>Twixt takes out a villain, baddies gang up and kick his ass.

Also, I say "Chess changed" because the rules-set of any game is not the game experience - that is a gel of rules, player skills, player attitudes, and whatever SC issues come up (such as house rules, etc).<br/><br/>So while Chess as written did not change, the experience did.<br/><br/>Also, I think I shall quit the field and lurk, as I have noticed I am having a very (odd, considering I do not okay MMORPGs) visceral reaction to this man's "research".

That is, the social dynamics normally stop griefer behavior.<br/><br/>I would guess that NCsoft figured Twixt was a griefer. How could they know he was a sociology researcher?

It might be for some people, so I've brought it up.<br>There are other things I can bring up, but most of my thoughts revolve around "performative actions", so my mind is in the groove of thinking about things that are true by merit of being thought about (kinda like SC?)<br><br>I also didn't bring up the social change in relation to the game-connection, but more as a claimer about how it works in a non-game setting. It was just bringing up how in real life we have in different ways things that are not "part of the rules" as "designed", and yet we treat them as real because of the Social Construct. I wasn't making a value judgment (I know the example seems to be that I am implying it, because race and racism are loaded issues, but I brought this up because the other example the professor used were way too abstract, and heck, that professor is about railing against the establishment).<br><br>It's true that a game is not a game while it's not played, like a play (theater) is not a play while it's not on stage.<br>But there is something that exists in-potentia, or even before that, aside from it.<br><br/>SC is part of the play, it's part of the on-going <i>activity</i>. It's not part of the rules, it's not part of what is there before the group sits down, and for different groups, there'd be different SCs. This is important, you see, because if you can identify something (anything) that stays constant amongst disparate groups, then that thing exists, on a different plane.<br/>Sure, for the group, SC is part of the System, but that's not the same as saying it's part of the Game's Rules.

In potentia isn't the same thing as in practice. In practice is what matters. Everything before practice is speculatory.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, obviously the text is important. If you break the rules stated in the text, you are no longer playing by the rules. But when the rules are being followed to the letter, whether or not they're being used as intended, and other social rules have evolved which dictate how they are followed, that demonstrates that the text is only a small part of the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, System as we use it is pretty much synonymous with rules. Rules govern behavior. System includes all rules that govern behavior, be they from the text or from the social situation. In other words, not all rules are written, and being unwritten does not stop them from being rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe we've taken this discussion to a very fundamental and abstract level, and it's beginning to seem that we're simply not going to agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221373/#Comment_221373" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T05:45:20+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  5:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 5:54AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An aside, SC also includes stuff that's not in the System as seen in the LP. SC also includes stuff that have little to do with the game, but rather with, "If I host, you help me clean."<br><br>System is not the same as rules, rules are included in system, but not everything that is system is rules. SC is sometimes included in system, SC are almost all rules (but not always game-rules), but sometimes they're only thought to be.<br><br>And yes, we're probably not going to agree.<br>Edit: But is that a "problem"? I wasn't entering this discussion trying to "convince" anyone, or "convert" them. That way lies frustration, and perhaps I lead others to frustration when they enter a discussion with me with that goal when I'm not into being converted. I'm not saying what I'm saying is right and what you're (plural you) is wrong. If one of us were 'right', then conversion might have had some place and merit.<br><br>I'm in this discussion to explore what people think on this, what they feel, why they feel that way, where their opinions are based, applicability they may see or fail to see elsewhere. Agreement is so far down on my list of goals, it's practically not there. I do think there are two sides to the coin in this discussion, as everyone who followed the discussion can see. I reject both sides when they say, "Nah--uh! Only what we say is right, you're all missing the point."<br>Heck, both sides miss the point, which is the other's side's point is just as valid. See also my claim above, about how this relates to people's morality issues.<br/><br/>So we're not going to agree, and? That's not a reason to stop talking. I think you meant that we've exhausted this discussion, having reached its "root causes", or as near them as we will in this instance, and as such, further discussion on this point is moot.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221389/#Comment_221389" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T07:12:08+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  7:12AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically, yes. What I meant was, I think we've gotten down to the point where basically all we can say is elaborate forms of "No it isn't." "Yes it is!"<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it's been an interesting discussion overall, but I don't know that there's more to say. This is especially problematic because while I enjoy a good debate for its own sake, I do tend to get into a "win" state once I've gotten going. This isn't to say I get irritated or pissed off, but it gets to the point that I'm arguing just for the sake of not giving up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we get there, I'd like to say that I think we're done. That is completely based on my ability to stick by it, which isn't something I'm especially good at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9879/city-of-heroes-article-playing-by-the-rules-vs-playing-with-others/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9879/city-of-heroes-article-playing-by-the-rules-vs-playing-with-others">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9879/city-of-heroes-article-playing-by-the-rules-vs-playing-with-others/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9879/city-of-heroes-article-playing-by-the-rules-vs-playing-with-others/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9879%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9879%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
