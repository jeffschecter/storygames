Its a short enjoyable read that Is quite relevant for role playing game design. While some elements are dated (there is some sexism) H.G. Wells tells the story of developing the first modern war game quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this part holds the most relevance today, (this part is in the appendix where wells is talking about the response to his game)<br/>\n<br/>\n"I have had quite a considerable correspondence with<br/>\nmilitary people who have been interested by it [little wars], and who have shown a<br/>\nvery friendly spirit towards it\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n. They tell me--what I already a little suspected--that<br/>\nKriegspiel, as it is played by the British Army, is a very dull and<br/>\nunsatisfactory exercise, lacking in realism, in stir and the unexpected,<br/>\nobsessed by the umpire at every turn, and of very doubtful value in<br/>\nwaking up the imagination, which should be its chief function. I am<br/>\nparticularly indebted to Colonel Mark Sykes for advice and information<br/>\nin this matter. He has pointed out to me the possibility of developing<br/>\nLittle Wars into a vivid and inspiring Kriegspiel, in which the element<br/>\nof the umpire would be reduced to a minimum"<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is a very clear argument for "system matters" and against concepts like "GM preference". It also provides a wonderful goal for rules development "vivid and inspiring".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway the book is a great read, I would love to know what all of you think about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268549/#Comment_268549" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T10:02:18+00:00" title="April 23, 2010 10:02AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kriegspiel-style wargames, in which there are two (sometimes three) identical boards, one for each player and potentially one for the umpire (I've always heard them called the 'referee') are pretty amazing.

WITH A SORT OF CHALLENGE<br><br><br>I COULD go on now and tell of battles, copiously. In the memory of the<br>one skirmish I have given I do but taste blood. I would like to go on,<br/>to a large, thick book. It would be an agreeable task. Since I am the<br/>chief inventor and practiser (so far) of Little Wars, there has fallen<br/>to me a disproportionate share of victories. But let me not boast. For<br/>the present, I have done all that I meant to do in this matter. It is<br/>for you, dear reader, now to get a floor, a friend, some soldiers and<br/>some guns, and show by a grovelling devotion your appreciation of this<br/>noble and beautiful gift of a limitless game that I have given you.<br/><br/>And if I might for a moment trumpet! How much better is this amiable<br/>miniature than the Real Thing! Here is a homeopathic remedy for the<br/>imaginative strategist. Here is the premeditation, the thrill, the<br/>strain of accumulating victory or disaster--and no smashed nor<br/>sanguinary bodies, no shattered fine buildings nor devastated country<br/>sides, no petty cruelties, none of that awful universal boredom and<br/>embitterment, that tiresome delay or stoppage or embarrassment of every<br/>gracious, bold, sweet, and charming thing, that we who are old enough to<br/>remember a real modern war know to be the reality of belligerence. This<br/>world is for ample living; we want security and freedom; all of us in<br/>every country, except a few dull-witted, energetic bores, want to see<br/>the manhood of the world at something better than apeing the little lead<br/>toys our children buy in boxes. We want fine things made for<br/>mankind--splendid cities, open ways, more knowledge and power, and more<br/>and more and more--and so I offer my game, for a particular as well as a<br/>general end; and let us put this prancing monarch and that silly<br/>scare-monger, and these excitable "patriots," and those adventurers, and<br/>all the practitioners of Welt Politik, into one vast Temple of War, with<br/>cork carpets everywhere, and plenty of little trees and little houses to<br/>knock down, and cities and fortresses, and unlimited soldiers--tons,<br/>cellars-full--and let them lead their own lives there away from us.<br/><br/>My game is just as good as their game, and saner by reason of its size.<br/>Here is War, done down to rational proportions, and yet out of the way<br/>of mankind, even as our fathers turned human sacrifices into the eating<br/>of little images and symbolic mouthfuls. For my own part, I am _prepared_.<br/>I have nearly five hundred men, more than a score of guns, and I twirl<br/>my moustache and hurl defiance eastward from my home in Essex across the<br/>narrow seas. Not only eastward. I would conclude this little discourse<br/>with one other disconcerting and exasperating sentence for the admirers<br/>and practitioners of Big War. I have never yet met in little battle any<br/>military gentleman, any captain, major, colonel, general, or eminent<br/>commander, who did not presently get into difficulties and confusions<br/>among even the elementary rules of the Battle. You have only to play at<br/>Little Wars three or four times to realise just what a blundering thing<br/>Great War must be.<br/><br/>Great War is at present, I am convinced, not only the most expensive<br/>game in the universe, but it is a game out of all proportion. Not only<br/>are the masses of men and material and suffering and inconvenience too<br/>monstrously big for reason, but--the available heads we have for it, are<br/>too small. That, I think, is the most pacific realisation conceivable,<br/>and Little War brings you to it as nothing else but Great War can do.</br></br></br></br></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268846/#Comment_268846" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T09:09:23+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  9:09AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wells could write!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
