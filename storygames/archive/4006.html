Chris, why don't you fill out The Big Three for us?<br><br><b>What is your game about?</b><br/><b>What do the characters do?</b><br/><b>What do the players do?</b><br/><br/>Because judging by what you've said so far, I can think of two very different types of games based on different answers to those questions. Example:<br/><br/>Game 1:<br/><br/><b>What is your game about?</b><br/>The game is about a lowly peasant who slowly rises to messiah-like status to throw off the oppressive shackles of a secular king.<br/><br/><b>What do the characters do?</b><br/>One character is the messiah, who quests to gain supernatural powers in order to fight against the King's troops. The other characters are hir posse, and protects hir on the quests. They, however, will never gain any supernatural powers.<br/><br/><b>What do the players do?</b><br/>The player who plays the messiah will direct play towards new quests where SHe might gain wisdom and power. The Game Master will provide opposition on those quests. The supporting players will ensure the messiah doesn't bite the dust on the way - the messiah is martially weak and requires swords for protection.<br/><br/>Game 2:<br/><br/><b>What is your game about?</b><br/>The game is about the uprising of a messiah, and how the characters react to the moral dilemmas of following hir.<br/><br/><b>What do the characters do?</b><br/>One character (the "Game Master") is the messiah, who determines the exact interpretation of the holy text as play goes along and orders/demands/requests tasks of hir followers. The other characters play faithful who are initially convinced of the messiah's authority, but as play proceeds their respective moral compasses will be challenged and their opinion may change.<br/><br/><b>What do the players do?</b><br/>The player who plays the messiah will be the spiritual leader of the uprising and will fight the game system to win against the orthodox forces. Along the way, the messiah player will challenge hir followers with more and more controversial tasks - if they remain with hir, SHe gains bonuses but if they rebel against the reinterpreted teachings hir challenge will be much harder.<br/>The supporting players will make hard decisions on how much to sacrifice for their new belief and messiah, and ultimately determine hir success or failure.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Hm. Let me squirrel away Game 2 for now, maybe I'll work on that at some point. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But, Chris, I think at least I would benefit from having those three at least vaguely filled out, so I know what you're trying to achieve in the game.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89867/#Comment_89867" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T13:44:05+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  1:44PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell you what my game is about...then someone would steal it from me!!!  (Just kidding.)  Sorry, I didn't think to share because the idea is still half formed.  That being said...<br/><br/>Well, I have a vaguely, half-formed idea based off the ending of the new <i>Dune</i> book <i>Sandworms of Dune</i>.  I don't think I'm giving anything away to say that there's a messiah...since it's Dune, but I won't say much more than that about the books.  The idea I sort of latched on to (for color anyway) is that someone has found a way to bridge two opposing forces (say magic and technology) to become the embodiment of that union.  However there are still other forces out there (religion, commerce, physical/mundane nature, government) that will oppose the dominance of this new combined force.<br/><br/>In this backdrop, the new human who embodies the union is going to suddenly feel the weight of absolute power and start to freak out a little.  One of the ways this freaking out manifests itself is a reliance on associates during the human's trials to attain ascension.  (I don't quite have HOW the messiah becomes messianic, though at this point I THINK that's still color.)  So the PCs play characters who have various agendas for the new messiah.  Some may believe the cause of the messiah and want to help him/her out, some PCs will attempt to manipulate the messiah to carry out their own agenda, some believe a martyr is better than a living messiah, some want the messiah to de-messiah and go back to the old ways.  Also, I think that the rules will allow a character to achieve messiahhood on their own...but there can be only one.  I think that allowing a different messiah will be up to the group when they're building the setting.  For instance, there can be only one Kwisatz Haderach (fate tends to kill the previous one to make room for the new one) or Highlander (until the sequel comes out and it turns out all immortals are really from space) but in a cult you can displace the former prophet and start spouting prophecy of your own.<br/><br/>So the PC becomes a fully autonomous entity that can act on the game world and do stuff while the PCs try to influence what stuff the messiah does.  One thing I do want to get across is that the messiah is truly powerful.  Either through magic or supernatural means or through the influence of a large number of cultists/believers or both (again looking at Paul Atreides.)<br/><br/>With that being said, here are the Three Questions in elevator pitch format.<br/><br/><b>What is your game about?</b><br/>This game is about the various lieutenants and behind the scenes powerbrokers who try to manipulate a messiah figure as he works to consolidate his power.<br/><br/><b>What do the characters do?</b><br/>The characters have an agenda and attempt to manipulate the new messiah into using his or her powers to becme<br/><br/><b>What do the players do?</b><br/>The players scheme amongst themselves and with NPCs as well as use various resources and connections in order to win greater control over the messiah.  The more influence over the messiah, the more the player controls in game events.  If the PC can make the messiah accomplish his/her agenda, it triggers endgame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89906/#Comment_89906" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T14:57:31+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  2:57PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2007 2:58PM by Daniel_M_Perez.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: commondialog</cite><b>What is your game about?</b><br/>This game is about the various lieutenants and behind the scenes powerbrokers who try to manipulate a messiah figure as he works to consolidate his power.<br/></blockquote>\nNo, this is what the characters do, better explained than in the second answer.
