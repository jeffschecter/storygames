I've been working on this game for a little while now, and I would love any feedback or comments. The documents are <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0hcgGllmSSGcE9xZWdTaUxuMGs?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Please let me know what you think!<br/><br/>This is a hook for the game to see if it interests you.\n<blockquote>\tDeep in a mysterious forest, there is a strange little town far from the prying eyes of others. The townsfolk have always been there, unchanging, living their lives trapped in a daydream. But things have changed since the Beast came. The days have become filled with sorrow and regret, the nights brimming with the aroma of death. The wickedness and lies of the townsfolk is bubbling to the surface, forgotten secrets only now being uncovered. What will be revealed in these dark times? Will the Beast be slain for good? Who will live, and who will perish? </blockquote>\n<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
