                    So, there's this guy Granovetter who wrote an article called <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/~rfrost/courses/SI110/readings/In_Out_and_Beyond/Granovetter.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Strength of Weak Ties</a>, which has pretty much blown the mind of everyone in the social software community, including me.<br/><br/>For those who don't feel like diving into the PDF, Granovetter argues that 'weak ties' (acquaintances) are actually more powerful for social networking and many practical benefits than 'strong ties' (family, close friends) are.  His idea is that people that you have weak ties with are much more likely to be in a different social community than you, and be able to access and leverage resources that you can't.<br/><br/>One of my core arguments about Why Games Matter has to do with weak ties, and how games help us form meaningful social relationships with people we wouldn't otherwise come into contact with.<br/><br/>My own group has been a powerful illustration of this, I think.  We come from many different communities, even though we have some underlying similarities (college-educated, for example), and we've been able to use our real-life resources to help each other in some pretty significant ways.  For example, when one member of the group had dental problems but no insurance, we found a low-cost way to get him to see a dentist.  Just last week, one member of the group found a job for another's boyfriend.  And more than one person in the group has been introduced to their significant other (and in one case, spouse) through this particular social connection.  Now, admittedly, many of us also became close friends through our gaming - but not every member of the group who's helped another has been close with that particular member.<br/><br/>So, basically, I'm curious about your own experiences, and whether your own gaming groups have been a source of good 'weak tie' connections for you!  What do you think?<br/><br/>--Jess                </div>

                            Oh I completely agree!  When I was a cellular sales rep and now, working in an office, I know a lot of people... mainly over the phone, that I can call and pretty much ask anything of.  We have nothing in common except that we work for the same university.  Heck, most of us don't even work in the same departments in the university.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the weak ties in my gaming group, I can say totally.  I am a freak for knitting, crocheting, and now cross stitch (pretty much any needle craft really) and because of my gaming friends, I was able to meet one spouse that knits.  One that cross stitches.  And another that sews.  We have nothing else in common besides the person that introduced us.  But I can now (and do) email with and chat with these women (yes they are all non-gaming wives) and have made connections through them with other needlecrafters in the area and thus, made my Stitch N Bitch group a bit tighter.  <br/>
<br/>
In a group I was part of a few years ago, I gave the daughter of two of our group members, a job, just based on the fact that she was their child.  I wouldn't have hired her normally as she wasn't even remotely qualified, but instead I took the time to train her and she did quite well for the time she worked for me.<br/>

                            I used to play Vampire: The Masquerade in a national organisation (One World By Night). It was remarkable. Just by being a member, and posting occasionally on email lists, people would offer you a bed if you came to visit their city.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you had to stay with weird gamer types, so swings and roundabouts.<br/>

                            The Forge is a great example of a lot of weak ties getting a whole helluva lot done.  While some folks have become very close friends through the Forge, most relationships probably fall under the "weak ties" category.  And yet that community of weak ties has encouraged and collaborated and guided each other to produce... I don't even know how many books at this point, and an entire subgenre of gaming.                        </div>

                            Also the Forge is noteworthy for attentive moderation, ready to smack down anything off-topic. <br/><br/>In the last year I've used Forge weak ties to connect with people who were more or less strangers in two foreign countries - Denmark and California - with great success.  It's strange to realize the tribe is taking care of its own in the real world.                        </div>
