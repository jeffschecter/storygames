Ergo, I am looking for artists.<br/><br/>I'm going to be looking not just for good art, but for a specific feel. Clean lines, a feeling of elegance or optimism, and beautiful vibrant color - the whole book is going to be full-color. Some of the stuff I've already made for it (and Daniel Solis' beautiful cover) can be found on my <a href="http://wrpigeek.deviantart.com/prints/" rel="nofollow">DeviantArt site</a>, but that's the extent of my artistic talent - I have no ability to draw people.<br/><br/>My pay is typically $25 per quarter-page, and I do usually buy quarter-page illustrations. Since this is probably going to be a 200-page book, I'm going to need quite a few pieces. My checkbook quails in terror, believe me. Artists will get to keep the rights to their work, including the ability to resell it to others.<br/><br/>If you know anyone whose art fits those criteria and is willing to work for that price, please let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76097/#Comment_76097" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T10:09:27+00:00" title="June 16, 2007 10:09AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to those of you who've e-mailed me. I'm working on contacting folks right now, and am sort of "going down the chain", while simultaneously planning for the precalc class I'm teaching this summer. I got quite a few responses. I promise I'll send out e-mails or PMs by the 22nd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
