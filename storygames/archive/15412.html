Thought I'd share.<br/><br/>So, let's see, I'm 15, and I'm in the local Dr. Who fan club, because, well, there's a girl I like in there. (And I thought Dr. Who was cool because I'd seen it a few times when I lived in Australia, but I really didn't know much about it - I thought Tom Baker was the first doctor, for example.) I've GM'd a little at this point, D&amp;D, TFT, Paranoia, and so I get the Doctor Who RPG and I invite the guys and girls--mostly girls!--from the fan club over to play it. I am beyond excited because the girl I like is coming over to play an RPG with me. This is a girl who would dress up as Tegan at the conventions. So. Pretty cute. This is unprecedented. I can't even sleep.<br/><br/>Character creation must have went by okay, or maybe there were some pregens, I don't remember. We had been playing for about five minutes - I'd read the opening paragraphs of the module, and was just starting to get to the 'What do you do?' and it's the turn for the girl-I-like. <br/><br/>"What do you do?"<br/><br/>I wish I remember exactly what she said. Something like, "How should I know!? It's not even real!" I'd never heard such an acid tone out of her before, she was normally something of a wallflower.<br/><br/>Well, that killed that. We hung out for the rest of the afternoon and ate the snacks my mom had bought and the whole time I was in a state of shell-shock. <br/><br/>Never did anywhere with that girl...<br/><br/><br/>So, what about y'all? What are your gaming scars?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349726/#Comment_349726" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T12:02:58+00:00" title="November 26, 2011 12:02PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2011 8:15PM by Andy.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hah! I wonder how many "there was this girl/guy I liked..." 's factor into these stories.<br/><br/>I have two:<br/><br/>\u25ce In junior high school, I played a lot of AD&amp;D (2e). It was a mixed-gender group. Anyway, when TORG came out I became a huge fan, buying up stuff, noting ideas, etc. I wanted to play it. But since I was the only one that Had The Stuff, that meant that I had to GM it. No biggie.<br/><br/>There was a girl I liked*, the best friend of the girl in our AD&amp;D group (but only played once or twice herself). Anyway, one thing led to another and she was coming to my TORG game. So the group was my best friend, the girl from AD&amp;D, the girl's friend (the girl I liked, and yeah while I liked TORG about 70% of that day was me getting an opportunity to be near her)... and that was it. Three players. All my other friends from the AD&amp;D group were away or busy (it was some holiday weekend). For some reason I thought "an RPG cannot happen without four players", and thus my best friend brought his friend Jackass. Jackass later turned out to be a good guy, but at the time (and for a longer time) was a pretentious jackass, who stuck his junk into anything for a proto-hipster laugh in that "I'll try anything once with a sense of smug superiority" way.<br/><br/>Long story short, I learned then the importance of premade characters, and "saying no" (although I didn't really use that one until much later): We made our characters together. There was a ninja, some other characters... and Jackass makes "A sentient flying table that throws explosive dinnerware". I tried to get the better of him by rolling with his punches, "Oh yeah I can see that, perhaps some horror of the Orrorsh cosm. And rules-wise it all works". Cue Jackass trying to take it one step further (doing random shit, etc), and me rolling with it with a strained smile on my face, and so on and so on.<br/><br/>I became so exhausted by our one-up exchange (him trying to stab the game, me gleefully keeping it together) that I totally lost all focus on making the game fun (much less for the girl I liked), etc. It's not like everyone walked away angry or anything, and I still liked that girl afterwards, but my attempt to making gaming fun for the girl I liked was totally ruined by Jackass. She thought that gaming was a lumbering, awkward experience and never seemed interested in trying it again.<br/><br/>(trigger: In-fiction sexual assault)<br/>\u25ce Another thing that happened much later, but still almost a lifetime ago, was in college over the summer between my freshman and sophomore years: I was a dorm RA (think admin/maintenance/"mentor" etc). There was an older guy connected to my fraternity-of-sorts (so not a guy I could just write off and ignore forever, we were going to run into each other regularly forever), who ran a twice-a-week AD&amp;D game in the lobby of my dorm. A mixed group of guys and women set in the Forgotten Realms. <br/><br/>Later I'd understand that the guy was a control-freak railroader who just turned up the heat to Infinity if you tried to do something that deviated from the plotline. But at the time I just chocked it up to him being an asshole and left it at that.<br/><br/>Anyway, he invited me into the game knowing that I was another RPer (but in also sort of an alpha-male way to See How I Handle My Shit/test my Gaming Excellence and all that). I created a Rogue character, basically a female princess-turned-pirate/thief from an Arabian-analogue of the Forgotten Realms. In the first adventure, we had me and the other PCs captured by a pirate captain and locked in a prison-cage on his pirate vessel. Later on I would realize that the DM meant to take us from A to B without incident, and that the pirate captain was some untouchable bad guy related to a plotline to be resolved later, therefore the DM put him "off limits" to fucking around with. But at the time, since we were caged up, I figured "What do heroes do when caged up? Escape!" So I pickpocketed (successfully) a guard, got the keys, snuck out of the cage. Then I went upstairs to go backstab the pirate captain. <br/><br/>Long story short: I failed three attack rolls. The captain grabbed me, cut my achilles' tendon (in gruesome detail) and raped my character (not, thankfully, in gruesome detail). My face was basically a mask of "WHAT THE FUCK????", and he sensed that, so broke into a diatribe on "Well, logically that's exactly what would happen, right? This guy is a fighter and you're a thief, so going at him one on one was a bad idea. And he's a pirate, so that's why he raped you." I don't remember any of the rest of that session (I was still dumbfounded and honestly totally squicked out: I tend to really immerse into long-game characters, so yeah...), just that the other players were nodding their heads (including the girl!) going "Yeah, that totally makes sense". The DM threw me a soothie because one of the PCs had a potion which cured my destroyed legs. I stuck around for the rest of the session, but made up excuses not to play for the rest of the summer. <br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Recently, I was reminded of my own mortality; neither here nor there, but just a few months ago I learned that she died of cancer at 35. Yikes. I pour out a little marbled d20.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349734/#Comment_349734" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T16:18:01+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  4:18PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 12:46PM by jackson_tegu.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Trigger alert: in-fiction sexual assault.)<br/><br/>I have a story similar to Andy's second one which sits as my break-away worst rp experience. <br/><br/>Middle school was over, as was high school, &amp; most of my gaming group had moved away. I'd gotten back into it &amp; had played a bit of d&amp;d 3.5 which had come out in the interim. I was glad, however, to see an ad in my Friendly Local Game Store for an ongoing ad&amp;d 2nd Edition game which promised lots of "character interaction and camp time". Cool. Sounded like not-just-die-rolling. <br/><br/>So my one friend and i go, and make characters - i'm a bad-ass human fighter named Imri. There were already five other players, plus Dungeon Master, and each of those players (besides my old bud and myself) were playing two characters apiece. Tellingly, only one of those characters (yes, of the ten) was female, and was of the large-breasted-cleric stereotype. Sometimes i don't know when to walk away. <br/><br/>I haven't yet mentioned that Imri was a woman because i didn't really expect it to matter that much, though i myself love me some strong female characters. The way the game "worked" was that a player would say their character's back-story, &amp; then the DM would revise it, if necessary, to fit it into the game world. <br/><br/>I rolled a low constitution score for Imri, which meant that she had a low hit-point total. I was stoked on this because it was a non-optimal choice for her to be a front-line fighter, but i saw her as someone who persevered in the face of difficulty. I decided that her constitution used to be much higher (backstory!), but she got into a disagreement with a city guardsman at a bar &amp; several of his colleagues were there, a fight broke out, after they couldn't beat her with fists, one of the (cowardly, yes?) guardsmen drew a sword and ran her through, giving her the name Imri run-through. Yes!<br/><br/>No. Instead, the DM decided that Imri was at a bar &amp; was flirting with some guy, even though she was really ugly. (What?) The guy turned out to be a guardsman, and that guard and several others (said the DM, kind of gleefully) took her out into an alley, raped her, ran her through with a sword &amp; left her for dead. He went on to wheeze horribly, mimicking the way Imri was to breath in his revision. <br/><br/>I was pretty stunned. Everyone at the table was into it, or at least said nothing. This was my first time here, and the DM sexually assaults my avatar in her backstory. Huge "what the fuck". And i didn't, to my discredit, flip the table &amp; wreck the room. Nor did i tear the fucker's screen in half, which would have been a lovely tear-down-the-walls metaphor. Nor did i even (more maturely) talk to the DM afterwards about what a terrifying experience that was, and how he really should learn about responsibility to others.<br/><br/>I sat out the sesh, agreed to come back &amp; then left there with no love in my heart. What fuckers! Fuckers, all.<br/><br/>Whew! thanks for letting me get that off of my chest.<br/><br/><br/><b>EDITED TO SAY<br/>SIGNPOST:<br/><br/>If you're just joining us,<br/>this thread has a bit of an argument until post number 21 or so. <br/>After that, we can pick it back up &amp; address the Original Post directly.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit" title="NCLivingBrit"><img alt="NCLivingBrit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit">NCLivingBrit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349737/#Comment_349737" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T18:49:39+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  6:49PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2011 7:22PM by NCLivingBrit.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mine is a terrible tale of forbidden yearnings (not mine) and actual brutal assault (mine).<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle bit of background:  I went to a single-sex (dudes) Senior school in a county in southern England that did the whole "uniforms and school ties and blazers and a school song and founders day at a catholic church and all that other tosh" that is supposed to have moulded me into a fine figure of a man.  It didn't, but you can imagine that as a teenager in an all-boys school you have fairly limited access to girls and you may end up not noticing directed interest of a romantic nature in other people other than to call everyone and everything a "poof".<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first gaming group was an AD&amp;D 2Ed group run by a friend of mine called "Bob" who was the willowy and very elfin only son of two bloody great big (6ft-ers, even the mum) ruddy Scots folks (had to be a changeling) who ran a rough pub just down the road from our school.  There was usually four or five of us with "Bob" GMing since his dad bought him all the books and dice and modules and stuff.  The campaign was the usual schlock that first time gamers in their early teens start with, lots of monster killing, loot stacking, wench mauling and badass being.  We played for a year or so with the odd change in the group, but one constant was that "Bob" would always have a GMPC, usually a support class like bard or druid or something.  All of them were female elves, all of them looked pretty much like "Bob" did (I mean the guy was very much in the Legolas mould in RL, so a frothy top or robe and some leggings and the young fellow could have been Legolisa) and all of them had romantic aspirations directed at someone within the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs not much time passed, it became noticeable that these aspirations seemed to focus around my pair of characters, both warrior types (one human fighter and I think the other one was a half-orc barbarian) who were (in my own little cesspit of wish fulfillment) brutal murdering mercenary arsehats who lowered the tone and population density of everywhere they went, but turned out to be generally unkillable and amassed much lootz, ale and whores.  Since we were all relatively innocent (for male teenagers) as to the nature of relationships, it was generally assumed that "Bob"'s elves (they got killed a lot) constant attempts to attach themselves to whichever of my jackasses was in play was for a) protection or b) free lootz.  The "relationships" were horribly tawdry nuggets of RP involving phrases like "I bugger the elf chick and pour beer on her boobs!" that were (for me at least) minor comedy (giggle!) bumps in the road to amassing more magic items, dragon hoards and awesome-wicked spiky armour with big studded gauntlets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings would have gone more or less fine, with me being all clueless and only a little weirded out if "Bob" hadn't slipped and blurted out that he loved me during a respite scene in a dungeon where we were waiting for our medkit... I mean cleric to sleep and get new spells.  Since I thought it was in character at first, I started shouting (in character) at the latest incarnation of delicate clingy elf groupie, because she had only met me two sessions before and hadn't even been beer-buggered yet.  Then as "Bob" turned out to be crying in real life rather than the game, comprehension dawned, I became violently offended and started kicking over furniture and bellowing terrible oaths of grisly 'orrible murder at "Bob".  I was (and am) sort of a big bastard and played rugby for the school, so "Bob"'s not-large buddy (forget the guys name) got in the middle to prevent me breaking a neck in a fit of teenage homophobic rage and for his trouble got kicked in solidly the balls then kneed in the face which snapped him back into the crappy coffee table we used for gaming, breaking some legs off.  "Bob"'s enormous and brick-red (the guy always looked like he was having a massive coronary event) publican dad arrived in time to stop me doing any more damage (I had not expected to get a long spray of nose-blood splashed across me as the guy flew backwards like a gutted mook in a kung-fu movie) and was surprisingly gentle about putting me in a headlock, dragging me downstairs and tossing me bodily out the pub as I tried to get at his "bloody ponce poofter son" (paraphrased, I was a little agitated and likely not too inventive in my invective) to exact my staunchly heterosexual revenge rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, beautiful scene, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think I spoke more than five words to anyone in that gaming group for the rest of the year (I ended up being the pariah of course, since I escalated from talking to violence and rolled a crit in the first round), but I did bump into "Bob"'s mum in the Old Town a couple of times.  She was actually pretting understanding and instrumental in me burying my grudge against her son and apologising for kicking the crap out of his friend (the broken table was apparently not important).  I did eventually game with most of those guys again before I quit school (too cool for school!), although "Bob" was forewarned not to ever try and sex-up my characters (and by extension my own person) again.  Guess it was just a phase (or he's doing a bloody good job of hiding it), since last time I heard anything about him (which would be 20 years ago now) he had butched up, ran the pub with his folks and was married to some hottie with a kid on the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think I have played AD&amp;D since.<br/>\n<br/>\nUPDATE:  Google street view is a little creepy.  I just went back and checked the place out and it hasn't changed a bit on the outside, but is now apparently a yuppie "country inn and restaurant" rather than a brawly thug pub.  Weird to see all the old places, the ones the same make the changes more jarring....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349740/#Comment_349740" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-27T01:03:34+00:00" title="November 27, 2011  1:03AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2011 3:32AM by Matthijs.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NCLivingBrit, I'm reacting emotionally to your post a bit. The image of that poor fucking kid  trying to speak his feelings, then having to hide behind his friend who's getting beaten up and bleeding because another friend is going mental, is pretty horrible. <br/><br/>I understand you mean to show that this is not an episode you're proud of. And it's a long time ago; none of us are the people we were 20+ years ago, I think. <br/><br/>However, the way you tell your story seems to have a humorous distance to the violence - "like a gutted mook in a kung-fu movie" - and to whatever    went through - "Guess it was just a phase (or he's doing a bloody good job of hiding it)" - makes me wonder if this is something you've reflected on, taken the consequenses of. I'm quite sure this experience would have a HUGE impact on 's love life, and his decisions whether or not to show his emotions to others later. You speak of "breaking a neck", and it's likely that  felt he was in grave physical danger. If my first experience with telling someone I loved them was that they clearly wanted to kill me, my life would have been pretty different.<br/><br/>These are all words on the internet, though, and I might be missing something in your tone, or you might not have expressed yourself in the way you meant. So I'm curious to hear more about what you think about this episode in retrospect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349744/#Comment_349744" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-27T07:22:45+00:00" title="November 27, 2011  7:22AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Matthijs said, pretty much verbatim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit" title="NCLivingBrit"><img alt="NCLivingBrit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit">NCLivingBrit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349758/#Comment_349758" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-27T19:05:41+00:00" title="November 27, 2011  7:05PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2011 7:22PM by NCLivingBrit.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, to be honest I am not someone who takes much emotional consequence from anything (especially violence) after my first year of high school, for reasons far too convoluted and undoubtedly slanted by memory and a good, deep repression to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a sort of gallows humour to my tale, it's because that is more or less my usual tone.  I'm sure this was a fairly horrific and formative episode in the life of "Bob" and no doubt to a certain extent his friend, but for me it was just another one of the bloody awful (but nostalgically fairly funny) things that happened to me in senior school and the years beyond.  I'm the guy that finds the humour in everything, be it political scandal, natural disaster or impending world-ending event.  So, yes, even though "Bob" stood a fairly good chance of getting seriously injured and definitely had his emotional landscape nuked..... It isn't and wasn't that big a deal to me once I had cooled off.  I suppose that I haven't reflected on it in the manner you mean, because reflection would require me to have given this episode significance in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough happenstance or intent I have always been very good at letting people "pass".  Funerals, even family ones are sad but not tragic, old friendships are remembered fondly but there is no real desire to look them up and renew contact.  I generally care a bit less than average about the good opinions of others (even when I should) and it shows in my manner and willingness to speak my mind, sometimes when it would be the caring thing to keep my mouth shut.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not some distant loner type.  I make friends easily and generally find confidence and trust easy to achieve, it just isn't something I care about that much if it goes away.  I am horrible at remembering names and people and it is almost always someone else who initiates the "didn't you go to/work at/date............?" conversation and most of the time I have no idea who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is probably the most organised look at this aspect of myself I have made in decades.  I guess I have grown used to and comfortable with an internal distance and a certain lack of authentic connection with my fellow man.  If my tone seems offensive or flippant or callous, I suppose you will have to consider the yardstick we each measure those things by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349762/#Comment_349762" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-27T21:57:11+00:00" title="November 27, 2011  9:57PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, good!

It's unlikely to elicit a sob, but might be good for a hearty groan or two.<br/><br/>In my childhood game group, which ran from around ages 13-18, the players had a pretty contentious attitude toward the GM. Well actually, there were two GMs, me and my best friend Lee. I never saw much contention toward Lee, and remember a LOT of contention toward me, though obviously this may be observer bias. The more I think of it, it was probably more that Lee, when given shit, was able to defuse and deflect it far more gracefully than me. He was incredibly likeable and always socially in command of the room, roleplaying or no. If Lee made a GM call you didn't like, and a word of protest escaped your lips, he'd likely just arch an eyebrow and you'd shut up and roll with it, or else he'd jovially escalate within the fiction, like the "reverse haggling" incident, where the more the player tried to argue the price down, the shopkeeper would just keep raising it, until finally the PC accepted the now exorbitant amount.<br/><br/>Whereas I encountered balking and argument at every turn, and no amount of nasally "come on, you guys, knock it off!" would assuade them. One time, I don't even remember what decision they were disputing, the whole table, including both my brothers, erupted in a chant of "Kill the NPC! Kill the NPC!" (no, they weren't advocating murdering a mere character; NPC was our garbled term for gamemaster, based on bogus info from Lee, who owned all the books. I think it parsed in our heads as "Non Character Player.")<br/><br/>So, my story:<br/><br/>My very first time GMing Middle Earth Roleplaying, I was 15 years old and nervous. I'd GMed Marvel Superheroes and Heroes Unlimited, but that was easy. You're patrolling the city, when A VILLAIN ATTACKS! But how does one come up with a fantasy adventure? Lee had already used the sample adventures in the MERP book. Where could I turn for inspiration? I turned to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadis" rel="nofollow">SHADIS Magazine</a>. I'd scored a couple of random issues from the local game store, and one of them had an article on adapting the plots of popular movies into adventures for your favorite roleplaying system. That sounded like just the hook I needed.<br/><br/>I decided to cleverly adapt the move <i>Alien </i>to Middle Earth (or at least the zany Monty Python-esque approximation of Middle Earth that appeared in our games). I was so proud of myself! This was going to be great. My adventure would write itself, and the fantasy trappings would surely obscure the source material, right?<br/><br/>If I'd settled for just the basic outline, I might've been OK. "Get trapped in a castle while a monster's on the loose" would be an innocuous enough premise. .But noooo, I had to nail the details. I made a castle map out of a photocopy of the X-Mansion map from Marvel Super Heroes, and then I added...air ducts. Because, you know, <i>Alien</i>. and then I found the make-your-own monster rules in the MERP book, and statted out a "demon" with attributes remarkably similar to a Giger-designed xenomorph.<br/><br/>So we played, I railroaded them into this mountain castle, and an earthquake blocked the trail, so they'd be trapped when the monster struck! They played cat and mouse with it, until they encountered it at close quarters and someone inflicted a critical wound. They calculated damage and were ready to move on to the next action, when I said "wait, there's a special ability I've got to check," and started inspecting the monster's stats.<br/><br/>The players stopped and stared. "Does it have...<i>acid blood</i>?"<br/><br/>"Um, yes," I sheepishly admitted.<br/><br/>"Ok, that's it, we're leaving," they said.<br/><br/>"Leaving?" I repeated. "But, but...you're trapped in the castle. There's no way out!"<br/><br/>"We'll go out the back windows and CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN."<br/><br/>I was utterly defeated. The players revolted, and insisted that their characters all walked over the mountain and <i>out of the adventure</i>. All my hard work, for nothing. I as humiliated, and seething with resentment. Apparently Lee could rip off Blackadder, Saturday Night Live, The Princess Bride and Cerebus for HIS GMing, but my Ridley Scott riff was over the line.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>At least with all the disgust over that, nobody noticed that all my NPCs were comprised of the human cast of <i>Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears</i>.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350366/#Comment_350366" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-03T01:19:10+00:00" title="December  3, 2011  1:19AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite><br/>At least with all the disgust over that, nobody noticed that all my NPCs were comprised of the human cast of<i>Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears</i></blockquote>\nHA!<br/><br/>Man, as a 24 year old I wished I had been roleplaying all my life, but more and more I'm happy I wasn't doing this shit when I was 15.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350372/#Comment_350372" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-03T06:19:44+00:00" title="December  3, 2011  6:19AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once decided to include hand-crossbows that were self-loading AND had "magazines" of bolts on them, entirely in order to recreate the convenience store scene from <i>Grosse Point Blank</i>... instead of, I don't know, just running a damn game that took place in a civilization with firearms and microwaves. This was high school. <br/><br/>My GM was once so insistent on killing us that:<br/>- this guy Dan, playing a ninja, was riding an airship to Gnome Island. His character was magically good at acrobatics, so when the ship was coming in for a landing, he said, "I backflip and land on the airstrip."<br/>GM: "But you're still 1000 feet up."<br/>Dan: "Oh! Well, I guess I don't do that, then."<br/>GM: "But you already said it." <br/>Dan: *looking over his character sheet in a hurry* "Oh, whew - I use my Drill Attack technique to spiral into the ground and not die."<br/>GM: "Ah, well... the ground is titanium-enriched. You die on impact."<br/>Dan: "I hate you."<br/>This was middle school.<br/><br/>Also middle school:<br/>Same GM, by the way. Basically, Dan and I were in a clearing. Dan was a cleric, and I was a wizard. We were both crappy warriors. An orc approaches, and seriously, every damn orc we ever encountered in this game was a powerful fighter-mage. So when the orc casts Earth 2 and piledrives me into oblivion with a ton of earth, I weep silently, knowing there is no recourse for me. Dan is about to run when a lightning bolt hits the orc and kills it.<br/>Little do we know that our friend Marty the elf-mage (with lightning powers) is hiding in the bushes. <br/>GM does not explain this. <br/>We complain about how arbitrary that was. GM suggests, "Well, he's dead, isn't he?" Does not deign to tell us why.<br/>I complain that he should have just bolted the orc to begin with instead of killing me. <br/>GM: "It doesn't work that way."<br/>Us: "WHAT doesn't work that way?"<br/>GM: "I can't tell you."<br/>Me: "I am so tired of this kind of thing. I quit."<br/>GM: "..." <br/>Marty later explains to us that he had ended his last session in the thicket near the orc's position, and seen all three of us there. GM had told him to roll a d6, and the result would determine which of us he hit with the lightning spell (who knows why... Marty could definitely choose his spell's targets, usually). <br/>The really weird part was that the GM, who never did tell us himself what had been the cause of the offending bolt, decided it was more important to maintain secrecy than to stop one of his players from quitting the game.<br/>Sigh. It wasn't THAT big a deal, but I was always the buttmonkey in these games, getting killed all the time, sometimes for no clear reason or quite unexpectedly. Our GM loved being an "evil genie", taking us too literally when it suited him. <br/>Naturally, this is why that whole "mistake and correction" element in Apocaworld appeals to me so much - - <br/><br/>[from p162 - APOCALYPSE WORLD]<br/><i>Keeler\u2019s player, to Bran\u2019s: \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of your shit.

I imagine it started out as tension that escalated; one player was a bit of a shit disturber (he was a curious character, warm hearted guy who'd occasionally pull a cruel stunt), the other was a very bright, shy guy but with a kernel of rage.<br/><br/>On a break from our Rolemaster game the former tagged the latter with a BB gun; maybe accidentally, maybe not.  From there it escalated into naked revenge, culminating in a point-blank shot to the forehead from a paintball revolver.  The resulting grappling shattered a folding closet door.  I jumped into the middle to try to stop them (though if I had any effect it was symbolic, they both had 20-30lbs on me), while the biggest guy in the room just sat back, laughing.  I was ticked at him for not doing anything, but in hindsight I imagine he was terrified, like I was.<br/><br/>I have very little memory of the emotional aftermath; I was pretty clueless back then.  I imagine the lead-up was plainly visible.  If I could be a fly on the wall now, though, I bet I'd be writhing with discomfort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350603/#Comment_350603" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T16:17:18+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  4:17PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a scar from seventh grade, May of '81.<br/><br/>I was DM'ing for Jennifer, Meredith, Wendy and sometimes Kelly.  We played once or twice a week after school.  We were really into it at the time and sometimes played at lunch.  We'd play in the media center or, when the weather was nice, behind the north side chain link baseball backstop on the far side of the field away from the school.<br/><br/>Kelly wasn't there this particular day but Chris, the boy who liked her and didn't like me was.  Along with three of his buddies.  They came from either side of the backstop and with the perimeter fence behind us we were effectively trapped.  Chris had given me and some of the other "media center lunch dorks" a hard time several times previously.  He and Kelly were "going out," as much as anyone in seventh grad is, and he resented her hanging out with us.  The day before he had thrown me to the field in what was supposed to be touch football in gym.<br/><br/>Because they'd hassled us before, we all stood and asked them to go away.  Two of them grabbed my DM's Guide and Monster Manual along with my dungeon and notes.  For a while I was just asking for my stuff back and trying not to escalate things, but Chris was calling me ugly names and trying to provoke a fight.  He pushed me several times and when I finally pushed him back he threw the first punch.  I'd like to say it was four on one but it was basically just me and Chris, with the others keeping the girls from running away to get a teacher.  I was a late-bloomer and he was quite a bit bigger than me.  I was trying to wrestle him so as not to get hit.  At one point he shoved me into the fence where the skin to the right of my right eye opened up and started bleeding like crazy.  He got a shocked look on his face and they all edged and then ran away.<br/><br/>I needed several stitches and still have the scar.  My books were pretty much a total loss - ripped in half and in a deep mud puddle.  The ~$20.00 dollars to replace them ($12.00 &amp; $8.00) represented a huge sum of money to me that I could not afford at the time.  The group sort of dissolved that summer for a bunch of reasons.  I remember being embarrased at being beat up and got pretty moody for a while.  I started taking taekwondo and hapkido.  The following year in eighth grade I played TFT exclusively.  It was cheaper and it had solo quests so I could play by myself while I tried to get a group back together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350625/#Comment_350625" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T19:43:57+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  7:43PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew, that's awful.

I don't think he would have anyway.<br/><br/>I got some nice sympathy from a lot of kids, especially from girls.  Some of them sort of ostracized Chris and his buddies for the remaining weeks of the school year and for some of the following year. <br/><br/>It sounds kind of pathetic and it was definitely an awful day but I remember middle school, especially eighth grade, fondly and was relatively popular for a four-eyed D&amp;D nerd.

I can't tell you why.<br/><br/>Man, I wonder about this!<br/><br/>On one hand, I'm tempted to agree. But on the other hand, I remember at that age really enjoying roleplaying, but being frustrated at these types of events. We were struggling to make our games as cool as we wanted them to be, and we knew it. We were always starting a new campaign which was "going to fix all the problems the old one had!" We sometimes played with some wiser, older roleplayers, and we loved it because the games were more interesting, more dramatic, less combat-oriented, etc. (I remember one instance where a player proudly told the rest of us how in a D&amp;D game with an older GM his character had this whole romantic subplot with a witch. We all listened to his story with awe and wished we could achieve the same in our game. Unfortunately, D&amp;D made it difficult for us to make that happen.)<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that if we'd had some better tools, we would have had a much better time, and better gaming.<br/><br/>I say this because I remember discovering or learning about many such tools and techniques at the time, and each time one of us did so the level of our gaming jumped up dramatically.<br/><br/>We weren't intentionally sabotaging our own games: we all wanted better quality play. We just had trouble getting there consistently, and treasured those moments when we did.<br/><br/>(I'm sure my young teen group isn't entirely representative of gamers in that age category, however. This was just my experience.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350685/#Comment_350685" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T11:29:43+00:00" title="December  6, 2011 11:29AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mathew,<br/><br/>Thank you for sharing that!
