                    Because people keep hijacking threads with this religious war, I will start a new thread here.<br/><br/>This is where people can ask questions about what a MUSH is or what IRC is, what the difference is, what the pros and cons of each are, and which is more suitable for different kinds of gamer activities (including, but not limited to, hanging out and chatting, playing tabletop games, and playing LARP-style games).                </div>

<b>Dogs in the Vineyard on MUSH</b><br/><br/>So I coded a little thing to keep track of things for running <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> on the MUSH platform.<br/><br/>Now, it's assumed that you put your character sheet on yourself as your <a href="/forums/profile/desc">@desc</a> or as a +view.  That means, in order to see your sheet, you type "look me" and it displays on your screen right there.  When your stats change, it's as easy as changing your <a href="/forums/profile/desc">@desc</a>.<br/><br/>Once a conflict begins, you set the stakes on the code object (typing "stakes Kill Br. Jeremy"), and people start rolling dice ("roll 3d4=Self-Sacrifice"), using them for raises and sees ("spend 3 4"), and accumulating fallout ("gain 3d4").  At any point during that conflict, all you have to do is type "look conflict" and it will tell you what the stakes are, who is in the conflict, what dice they have in front of them, and what fallout they've accomulated.  Once the conflict is resolved, you can type "fallout" and it rolls your fallout dice and tells you if you get experience, short-term, and/or log-term fallout.<br/><br/>Somebody want to describe how you play <em>Dogs</em> on IRC?                        </div>

                            Hi, :)<br/>
<br/>
El Fuego, as a strong proponent of MUSH over IRC, I'm going to play a little bit of devil's advocate and tell you that everything you describe can be implemented as an IRC bot. In fact, you could even go as far as having a bot that listens to @desc commands and keeps track of everything. Or, you could do it some other way, replacing the obscure @ thingie with something a little easier to remember for those not conversant with MUSH conventions.<br/>
<br/>
That said:<br/>
<br/>
Advantages of coded MUSH objects:<br/>
- They run on the server and keep the state info on the server<br/>
- They can be maintained by anyone who is online<br/>
Disadvantages of coded MUSH objects:<br/>
- They have to be coded in MUSHCode, which is tricky to learn, these days<br/>
- MUSHCode reads like random white noise<br/>
<br/>
Advantages of IRC bots:<br/>
- They can be coded in any modern programming language<br/>
- Some IRC clients already come with good bot support<br/>
Disadvantages of IRC bots:<br/>
- They have to run somewhere, other than the server<br/>
- They can only be maintained by someone who has access to the machine they run on<br/>
<br/>
Now, to me, I'm already completely fluent in MUSHCode, which means the advantages of IRC bots are nearly nil. On the other hand, the differences between IRCing and MUSHing aren't restricted to support objects:<br/>
<br/>
In support of IRCing:<br/>
- An IRC channel is conceptually simpler than a MUSH room<br/>
- Nowadays, resources for IRC users are more abbundant than for MUSH players<br/>
- IRC servers are already out there, whereas a MUSH has to be created and maintained by someone<br/>
<br/>
In support of MUSHing:<br/>
- Simultaneous games in a MUSH server are easier to set up, manage and follow than in an IRC channel<br/>
- MUSHes can persist the game state across sessions<br/>
- MUSH servers can be tweaked, recompiled and restarted on the fly, if the games need it<br/>
<br/>
I think all in all, a game is best served by a MUSH over IRC. IRC has some distinct advantages that we best to lose track of, however.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, Adam, it was awesome of you to set up the Foundry, but we best not forget that the Foundry will only be around for as long as you are able to keep it around. :) Although, I do recognize that FiranMUX has been up like forever, and that's enough to make me pretty willing to commit to and invest my time in the Foundry. But magicstar probably isn't going anywhere for the next ten years either.<br/>
<br/>
Also specifically, people that are already playing in IRC and enjoying it are not likely to shift their habits over to a MUSH just because they can. Unless we can demonstrate clear and present net advantages for them to do so, they won't switch.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping this thread develops into a demonstration of just that. :)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                            I'll start. <i>Edit: Well, I wanted to start, but Joao and Joshua beat me to it.</i><br/><br/><b>IRC</b><br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" rel="nofollow">Inter Relay Chat</a>, or IRC, is a server-based technology that lets people talk on virtual "channels" and also allows private person-to-person chat. It's been around for around 20 years (21 if you count its predecessor, Bitnet).<br/><br/>You can connect to IRC via plain ol' telnet or you can download a specialized IRC client like mIRC or even Trillian. The experience is always better with a real client; telnet sucks.<br/><br/>IRC provides very little server-side coding functionality. It manages channels, users and nicknames, and some privileges for channels and users. It's a virtual CB radio with security controls. People extend the functionality of IRC by writing scripted "bots" that connect like a user, listen for certain command strings, run their subroutines, then respond with text. A dice-roller bot might listen for "roll 2d6" and then respond with the sum of two random d6 rolls. mIRC has a built-in scripting language and there are some stand-alone bot programs you can run. My limited understanding of modern IRC is that all this cool code is client-side, meaning the dude with the dice scripts has to have his bot connected for you to use it.<br/><br/>We gamer folks have a channel called <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> on <a href="http://irc.magicstar.net" rel="nofollow">irc.magicstar.net</a>.<br/><br/><b>MUSH</b><br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSH" rel="nofollow">MUSH</a> is said to stand for "multi-user shared hallucination," but it doesn't really. It was just a play on MUD and they made up the acronym later. MUSH is another server-based technology that creates a text-based virtual world for people to explore. A user creates one or more accounts ("players") who can log in at the same time. The interface feels like ZORK or some other Infocom or Scott Adams game on steroids. TinyMUSH, a popular type of MUSH server, has been around since 1990 or so.<br/><br/>You can connect to a MUSH using plain ol' telnet or you can download a specialized MUSH client like SimpleMU. I've listed clients for other platforms elsewhere. The experience is always better with a real client; telnet sucks.<br/><br/>Connected players can create rooms and give them descriptions, link them together with doors ("exits"), and create other random objects ("things"). Each object has all kinds of predefined properties that a player can set to get different kinds of behavior. It's pretty trivial to set up a network of rooms with cute (and sometimes annoying) little messages that fire off when you walk through doors. <br/><br/>The game persists objects until they're deleted by a player. That means that all the game's code is available all the time. You can also persist data. This means that if you stop your Dogs game in the middle of a conflict, you can resume it a week later with your dice pools intact -- assuming the dice objects are coded that way (and that's how we're trying to code the game-specific stuff for Foundry).<br/><br/>MUSH has a built-in scripting language that is very powerful, but at times frustrating. My other MUSH project is <a href="http://firan.legendary.org" rel="nofollow">FiranMUX</a>, which has like 600,000 lines of custom softcode for a variety of systems from clothing to combat to economics to magic. While the script can be somewhat arcane, a programmer experienced with other languages can pick it up at a reasonable level in a short amount of time. <br/><br/><b>Experiential Differences</b><br/><br/>For me, one big difference is the feeling of <i>being there</i>. On IRC and other pure-chat media like AIM, the interface feels like a virtual telephone. I'm here. My friends are there. I can hear them and talk with them. On MUSH, the interface feels like a virtual world. I'm in there. My friends are in there in the same place as me. I can see them and hear them. I can gesture ("pose") in a natural way that supports immersion (oh noes! the I-word!). <br/><br/>Here's a <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~albasch/Capes/Transcripts/RoughJustice03.html" rel="nofollow">log of Capes played on IRC</a>. I don't know how much it was cleaned up. Here's a <a href="http://hamsterprophet.blogspot.com/2006/05/bryan-wins-death-stakes.html" rel="nofollow">cleaned-up log of Death Stakes played on Foundry</a>. It just seems to flow better on MUSH but that could be my personal experience/bias showing.                        </div>

My other game, Firan, has been around for 9 years now. If for some reason, I can no longer host Foundry, it's easy enough to port the whole thing somewhere else. I'd happily hand the database over at that point.                        </div>

<p>More "tactile" games - Dogs, Agora, Dust Devils all count at least - could definily use some coded features to help thing along. If it were up to me, I'd find it a lot easier to use my language of choice (frex, ruby) to encode an IRCBot, rather learn to make a MUSH object.</p>
<p>And yet, I've not yet had the time/urge to finish making an ruby-based bot, while lots of people have spun out some fantastic MUSH objects. So I'm very inclined to use MUSH for play, even if I find IRC to be a better social space.</p>

<p>Plus your mush keeps doing weird crap like disconnecting me and resetting and basically spamming with annoying stuff.</p>
<p>Plus there is the implicit culture war - this <em>whole class of discussions</em> is based on considering the entities to be separate communities, which they are, which are in conflict, which they are (in subtle ways - I have to run two clients to be connected to both, and that eats up precious space on my screen and in my attention).</p>

                            My problem is really simple: I hate every single IRC client that I've ever found.  Can anyone suggest a non-evil way for me to be on IRC?  Then I might actually consider using it instead of being a MUSH girl all the way.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            I've played RPGs on MUSHes for... over 10 years now?  I think they're definitely better than IRC channels.  All the reasons mentioned above apply, but I also think it has to do with atmosphere, a little bit.  Because of the "X says Y" and "X emotes" input structure, people tend to be a little more literate and composed on a MUSH: capitalization, punctuation, actual sentences, rather than a shotgun of single words or small phrases.  IRC logs tend to read like hacked up screenplays, whereas MUSH logs read a lot more like books.<br/>
<br/>
The longest MUSH game I'm aware of lasted 170 sessions, averaging 5 hours each.  My du -s tells me that there are some 13.1 MB of raw logs from this game.  Pretty amazing.<br/>
<br/>
One last comment.  I've played online with a lot of folks who I would call immersionists.  These are people who want to keep even out-of-character chatter to a minimum (and often confuse the phrases "OOC", "meta-game", and "out-of-game", which drives me bonkers).  We usually have segmented all such talk on a different "MUSH channel", which can be colored differently and only read when they wish to read it.  Personally, I find it a little frustrating, but I'm not unsympathetic to where these folks are coming from, I guess...                        </div>

Jess, I use Visual IRC. How that compares to other clients, interface-wise, I can't tell, as I don't have that much time logged in IRC. But it's free.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don't really see anything wrong with being a MUSH girl all the way. ;)<br/>

                            Um, okay, right.  It's like this:<br/><br/>I've done some MU* stuff before.  And it can be pretty dern cool.  But I always feel rather limited in a MU* environment.  I mean, sure, it feels like a real place, but that means it feels like it has real physical laws about what you can and can't do.  And I guess I don't see the advantages from interacting with scripted objects.<br/><br/>If I type: <code>go north</code><br/><br/>And the computer responds:<code>You walk through the door to the north and feel a cool breeze on your face as you step into the sunlight.</code><br/><br/>I don't see how it's different from typing, in a chat client (any chat client, not just IRC):<code>/me walks through the door to the north, feeling the cool breeze as he steps into the sunlight.</code><br/><br/>And in fact, the advantage in chat is that you can alter that description each time, which, in my mind, is a greater advantage than maintaining consistency.<br/><br/>MU*s may do a lot for you if you're talking more about <i>individual player experience</i>, where you want to do things and have your actions have consequences, as the scripted objects respond to you.  <br/><br/>But I'm not as interested in roleplaying with scripted objects.  I'm interested in having real people respond to me.  I'm interested in people performing for each other.  And MU*-based interaction, to me, feels like I'm trapped in a video game MMORG like Worlds of Warcraft, and I don't really dig those games.  I dig the feeling of sitting around with a bunch of neat people and constructing a play experience through conversation, without miniatures or maps (which is what scripted MU-objects feel like to me, more things to fiddle with).<br/><br/>So I guess that's why I have a preference towards chat-based play, be it IRC or whatever.<br/><br/>It's not about "Jonathan loves IRC bots" or whatever.  I fucking hate IRC bots.  It's about (what feels like to me to be) the purity of the communication medium.<br/><br/>And I don't buy the "people are more eloquent in MU."  You don't have to conduct chats as if you are a moron.  But some people bring their AIM persona over into chat-play, though that doesn't have to be the default.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, Foundry isn't some giant LARP world with a bazillion rooms and players act out their characters and 'go north' to find other characters. I think of it as a game convention center, with a handful of rooms for getting your game on, plus a lounge for chatting. <br/><br/>If you can figure out how to play With Great Power on IRC, I'd be curious how you'd do it. You've got to manage potentially multiple decks of cards per player, card and deck trading, and "slots" for cards on the table. It's screaming for a coded solution to manage it. Yeah, you can write a bot for it, but mushcode was basically designed to handle crap like this and once I get a moment to <i>breathe</i>, I'll modify my card system to handle all that.<br/><br/>I've found more people bring their AIM persona to IRC than to MUSH. I don't claim that the medium itself makes that happen, but it's there. <br/><br/>I'm not claiming MUSH or Foundry to be the end-all-be-it-all of Internet gaming. It isn't. It's just a tool. Use the tool you like. Last night I recommended a combination of Foundry + Skype or Ventrillo + virtual whiteboard. We can do online gaming better than we are today. If you prefer IRC better, cool.<br/><br/>But my goals for Foundry are more than a chat medium. I'm building a community. I'm good at building communities. I've done it for about 12 years. I don't know if the host of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> is good at that (who owns that channel anyway?). I've got people hanging out on Foundry lately <i>just 'cause</i> and I think that's cool. We chat, we get to know each other, and the broader indie gaming community is better for it.                        </div>

<p>IMHO, the existence of useful code widgets in the MUSH makes it better for gaming, esp. when you need those widgets.</p>
<p>But as for a lounge space? I totally don't know. The IRC has had its own sorta culture and vibe for a while, and Adam is doing a great job at creating a community on his MUSH, so I don't know what.</p>
<p>Now I have a crazy miracle idea: has anyone done an IRC &lt;--&gt; MUSH gateway? Maybe have special Magic Lounge where any chatted stuff is sent to an IRC bot that posts it up, and vice versa?</p>

                            Okay, thanks for better explaining what the Foundary is about, Adam.  That sounds a lot more interesting than what I was expecting from the word "MUSH."<br/><br/>So that leaves me with two concerns/things to think/talk about:<br/><br/>1) I really only have enough attention/time for a couple of online gaming thingees.  More than that, and I will get shit work done, including on my own games.  I already had to give up reading the Forge for Story Games, but that's been okay so far.  So I may poke around the MUSH a bit, but I can't spend a lot of time on both MUSH and IRC.  And I already have a fair number of comittments to Indie Netgaming (Shreyas' Exalted game, hanging out and chatting with Shreyas, Josh, Thomas, Selene, etc.).<br/><br/>2) Mark me down as being rather unsatisfied with directly porting most tabletop games to any online medium, whether chat or MU* or what have you.  If we're really going to play well in electronic spaces, we need games designed for the specific needs and strengths of these spaces.  We already have <i>Unaris</i> and a couple of my short games written specifically for chat play, and I'm excited about doing/seeing more work in that area.  Or people need to consider doing some serious adapting of existing systems to better support online play, instead of creating bigger and better bots/objects to handle stuff.  Like, I'd much rather play in a <i>With Great Power</i> game where the rules had been completely re-written to support online play than one using some huge card-manipulating script object.<br/><br/>But, yes, bitchy concerns mostly retracted.                        </div>

                            As far as MUSH-IRC gateways go, hook me up with a url and I'll install one. I would assume the MUSH-side interface will be something like automatically creating a MUSH channel for all (or each) of the ones that spawn from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a>. Anything said on that MUSH channel gets broadcast to the IRC channel, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Jonathan, you see the gap in ease-of-use and functionality when playing modern games online. I see the opportunity to help people who don't normally get to play those games do so using some hacked-together tools. Glass half empty? Glass half full!                        </div>

Adam: I'm personally fine with separate play spaces, so long as there can be a shared social space between the two. So this would mean only #indierpgs itself would have to be mirrored. I suppose that #indie_ooc and #indie_nar could also be mirrored without great difficulty, but that's not as important. If you intend to lurk or play on those games, you could log into the IRC, but I want to make the general chatter more accessible.<br/>

                            I've been thinking bout the pro/con thing for a bit now, and I guess I should offer up something substantive...<br/><br/><b>Clients</b><br/>IRC is an extremely popular protocol, and thus there are many, many clients for it.  This is good and bad.  Good because it means it is easier to find a client that is just right for you.  One that has the features and presentation and aesthetics that you want.  Bad because it means no one knows how to help you if you have problems outside of the most common clients.<br/><br/>MUSH, being less popular, has fewer clients.  This inverts the above pro/con thing.  You're pretty much stuck with one of a few clients which means fewer features and options, and if you don't like what you've got: tough.  However, it also means that it's extremely likely that someone already online is an expert in the use of the client in question.<br/><br/><b>Persistent Code</b><br/>MUSH beats IRC hands-down on this one.  While it's possible to code an IRC bot to do anything a MUSH object can do, the IRC bot is client side.  That means that if something goes wrong on the computer of the person running that client then the code is no longer available.  Since MUSH objects are server-side, once they are written and dropped they're available to anyone who wants one.<br/><br/>Of course MUSH is a ridiculously archaic programming language, whereas you can code an IRC bot in whatever language you happen to know.  This is actually not that big an issue for us specifically because apparently we already have a number of MUSH coders already, so no one's really forced to learn a new language.<br/><br/><b>Interface</b><br/>IRC was originally developed as a communications tool.  This means that the interface and hard-code are designed to facilitate communications first and other stuff is tacked on at the end.  This means it's easy to chat (just enter a line of text and hit enter), and that there's a unified command-access character (the "/") for doing anything that's not direct chatting.<br/><br/>MUSH was, as far as I can tell, originally developed as an immersive tool.  This means that the interface and hard-code are designed to facilitate immersion first.  This means that the command-access character <i>goes away</i>.  I mean, it's more immersive to say "get lamp" than "/get lamp".  Further, MUSH doesn't assume a default action for any line of text.<br/><br/>In IRC, if text isn't somehow special, it gets said.  In MUSH, if text isn't denoted as special with a command, you get an error message.<br/><br/><b>Everything else</b><br/>Beyond that, as far as I can tell, anything you can do in a MUSH you can do in IRC and vice versa.  MUSH's ":" is equivilent to IRC's "/me", and so on.<br/><br/>It becomes a matter of interface preference, which in many cases boils down to experience.  I've been using IRC for a long time, so certain commands are intuitive, whereas I have to think about them in MUSH.  And I'm sure the same is true of old MUSH hands in IRC.<br/><br/>For instance, I find it really annoying that just to say something in MUSH I need either a four key-stroke prefix ("say ") or a shift-keyed prefix (").  That slows things down unneccessarily!  (So I proclaim.)  I'm sure MUSH people don't even notice it anymore.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm all for growing the community, but I think it's unfortunate (not that I don't appreciate it Adam!) that we have a MUSH instead of a move to join the existing community in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a>.  At the moment I have to hang out in one place to talk to some people, and in the other to talk to others.  Why can't we all just get along?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Hi, :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, for one thing, I tried to take a peek inside #indierpgs, last Thursday, and I couldn't even find it. I did find a similarly named channel, #indie_nar3, where Mike Holmes was apparently idling, and a couple of people seemed to be in the midst of finishing up some interaction, which seemed like it belonged on Mike's HQ game, but I oculdn't be sure. Then, everybody disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Every once in a while, I start up Visual IRC to see if #indierpgs is around, but it doesn't seem to be... or maybe I'm looking in the wrong place... but I'm pretty sure I'm looking in the magicstar network...<br/>
<br/>
The MUSH, at least, will always be in that one same place... :)<br/>
<br/>

                            There's some debate over which of these to use? Huh.<br/>
<br/>
I use IRC because that's where Nathan Banks set up a place for us to meet and play. I find it interesting that people keep saying "Try to play X in IRC!" I play Hero Quest on IRC. Meaning I have to have a dicebot that rolls a d20. Pretty simple. Character sheets we keep on a Wiki.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that's what I don't understand about this debate. When we play, we go from the #indierpgs room to another room so that the conversation there, and in the room we're playing in, can be kept separate. I use a Wiki for storage, and I use email to communicate at times, meaning I'm using a browser. And I keep data in spreadsheets and text files of various sorts - whatever seems suitable. <br/>
<br/>
What I'm saying is, if you want to be social, come on over to #indierpgs, and chat - IRC works just fine for that. If you need a particular tool to run a game, well, then go to the tools and use them. If that's a MUSH, cool. If IRC works just fine for you, cool. If you need a browser, fire that up. Or whatever software you need. Fire up the CD player on the machine and listen to some music. <br/>
<br/>
What's the conflict? I'll come on over and play in your MUSH game, if you show me the ropes. If you want to check out my IRC game, I'll show you how. Neither is really very hard, are they? <br/>
<br/>
So what's the debate here? <br/>

                            I guess the debate's that some people feel having several places to go is dividing us up, instead of having one large gathering.                        </div>

                            One problem with MUSH vs IRC that comes to mind is that MUSH has a higher learning curve. I'm definitely still getting my head around using all the widgets in the MUSH, and even just normal chat is slightly more complicated than IRC, which (once you're connected) is just a normal chat box. That said, IRC isn't the easiest thing ever, and neither the #indierpgs nor Foundry communities are really for casual newbies who aren't willing to put effort into figuring out the IRC and/or MUSH thing. If we were going for user-friendliness, we'd probably want something nonstandard but much prettier, like  "Campfire":http://devp.campfirenow.com/751d7. I don't think we need such a thing now.                        </div>

                            The only gateway I've found thus far is "this one for IMC2":http://channels.dal.net/imc2/, but the author didn't include the all-important actual bridge code to connect channels other than his own. So I'll have to keep looking.                        </div>
