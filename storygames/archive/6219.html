The action was centered on a tight-knit family group on the Isle of Wight who were big political and military movers and shakers. My favorite part of the game was the way we structured it: each arc of the campaign (which each lasted about fifteen sessions) played out across a six-month period from spring to fall and was separated from the adjacent arcs by a four or five year jump. In between each of these arcs, the players were able to rejigger their characters. (In the case of the second jump, they got recreate them entirely, as we switched from using The Riddle of Steel to Burning Wheel.)<br/><br/>What I liked most about this was that we got see real character growth and closure. Take Aeron, for example. At the beginning of the game, he was a brash young soldier eager to prove his worth in battle. Over the course of that first arc, that\u2019s exactly what he did, winning the acknowledgment of his father and the respect of his tribe. He also discovered that there was more to life than being a skilled warrior, so when we advanced the timeline by four years and he went from being sixteen to being twenty, the player controlling him decided to refocus the character on learning how to be a leader. In later arcs, we saw the shine go off his idealism, and we saw his loyalty to his family put to the test. By the time we were done, he\u2019d gone from a scrappy kid to a respected elder.<br/><br/>In my mind, the time jumps were critical to this organic character growth. It allowed us to rationalize how the characters had changed and to adjust the external situation to focus on the new issues we wanted to explore, while at the same time giving us a great sense of continuity. It worked out far better than I could have expected. It was also important that the group the characters were all a part of stayed together, as its goals provided the through-line for the entire game. (Recently, a group I\u2019m playing with finished up the first arc of a game where I was tempted to suggest doing the same thing with, but we ended making far more drastic changes to the game instead.)<br/><br/>The game I was thinking about the other day is one where this sort of play was systematized. There are three games that I know of that do something close to this, but none is quite what I want. Hero\u2019s Banner is too focused on the \u201csingle important decision that determines the rest of your life,\u201d which counter to what I want. Pendragon can (and probably should) be played out over generations, but I\u2019m specifically interested in not playing every single year. I think In A Wicked Age might be the closest (I haven\u2019t played it yet), but I\u2019m interested in doing more than one chapter before jumping, and I want continuity of characters.<br/><br/>So there you go. I know what it is that I want, I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything that does it, and I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d go about doing it. But there it is.<br/><br/>(cross-posted from <a href="http://gameslinger-enterprises.com/" rel="nofollow">my new blog</a>.)<br/><br/>--Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137983/#Comment_137983" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T15:15:18+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  3:15PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bike helmets on to prevent brain damage, everyone....Jason's going to talk about VAMPIRE!!! *oh nooooes*<br/><br/>Back in Second Edition, the vampire elders' supplement Elysium specifically had a big chapter discussing using different time periods in a multi-chapter game, there were even rules to see how badass you got over time.

In unWritten you have Drives that are defined as personalities/motivations/character goals. (In your copy of unWritten I attempted a rule change that didn't work, so you're not aware of this aspect in the game.) The Drive is linked to the character arc that develops through play. Once you've completed the character arc you could then start a new game based on the previous characters in the story, by changing the characters Drive. You, in essence, change how he or she approaches conflicts, but this different approach is born from the characters previous experiences (aka the previous game). There is a problem with this, which is characters can finish their arcs at drastically different times. I think this problem is minimal and can be easily dealt with. Also, unWritten allows the players to frame scenes out of sequence, which would allow you to experience future events in the middle of the developing story. But that last example is farther removed from what you said your looking for.<br/><br/>An experiment I'd like to try with unWritten is to have each player play different members of a family in different generations, all during the same game. You play the son, the father, and the grandfather, but, the story takes place when they are all 16. So, it's three independent stories about a family that tightly weaves around a central theme... The cues.<br/><br/>Another experiment is to have each player play the same character, but at different times of the characters life, such as 16, 32, and 64. or something like that.<br/><br/>Anyway, those be my 2 cents!<br/><br/>alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko" title="schlafmanko"><img alt="schlafmanko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko">schlafmanko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138057/#Comment_138057" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T22:18:53+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:18PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2008 9:13AM by schlafmanko.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What exactly are you trying to get out of having a system for the jumps?

Or at least, not one very complex.  <br/><br/>As you know, when you make your next character, the Hero trait relates to the previous character in some way.  That's one of your three traits.  What else has three, hmm.<br/><br/>Beliefs!  It sounds like BW worked well for you before, so when you do the jumps, you could have each character have a belief that reflects on the previous character, or their previous state.<br/><br/>As for In A Wicked Age, I think it could be easily tweaked. First, a chapter really could be any length of time. If you wanted it to last a dozen 4 hour sessions, you could do that, although you might have to tweak some other things, otherwise characters will get to d0 in two stats long before then. Although, I think another option would be to pad the We Owe List, and the understanding that the first X number of chapters will be continuous and then you jump, so they have to limit growth to refreshing stats or adding to their particular strength(s). Or get into an idea of jumping through time. Sometimes it's about Aeron as an old vet, next session he's a young idealist learning to lead.  Either way should work.  To pad the list you could simply write down each character two or three times to get 8 or 12 chapters padded (or whatever you want). A more organic option is to decrease starting dice size (like d10, d10, d8, etc instead of starting with d12) to ensure that you can always hit them with bigger dice and put the PCs onto the Owe list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138218/#Comment_138218" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T14:23:40+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  2:23PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blue</cite>(Though as I type this, I am really tempted to scream PRIME TIME ADVENTURES and then run out of the room.)</blockquote>\nThis is, in fact, an excellent idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138247/#Comment_138247" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T18:21:38+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  6:21PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, PTA springs to mind immediately.<br/><br/>This also seems like gaming territory where systemic rules may not be the best solution.
