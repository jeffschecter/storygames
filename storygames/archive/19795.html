In the aftermath of controversies such as \u201cgamer gate\u201d and \u201cconsultant gate\u201d, and recent moves by mainstream publishers to reflect greater diversity in their games, how can we attract under-represented groups into our wonderful hobby? We talk about best practice from a number of conventions, especially the UK\u2019s Nine World\u2019s Geekfest, and explore how we can all make our spaces safer and more welcoming for everyone.<br/><br/><a href="http://twitchingcurtain.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/episode-two-the-blue-clothespeg/" rel="nofollow">Episode Two: The Blue Clothespeg</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
