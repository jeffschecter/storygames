My issues with Aspects are the same as with the Scrips in Full Light, Full Steam. They, in the applications I've seen, are primarily about recognition, reinforcement and appreciation for a largely static thing. They generate more verbal artifacts into the game-space to be appreciated by the group as illustrating that thing. This is not a bad thing. It just bores me. What you're suggesting (without a greater context) seems to be more or less the same thing but instead of producing verbal artifacts for appreciation you have literal artifacts.<br/><br/>I don't see much difference between having a stack of little pictures that are more or less there for everyone to hold up and say, "Look at these." than the pile of verbal transcript memories of all the times I got to say, "I"m a man of ACTION!"</blockquote>\nWhich inspired this SotC hack: The third time you invoke an Aspect, you must change or discard it.<br/><br/>--Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133891/#Comment_133891" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T22:41:34+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:41PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite><br/><br/>Which inspired this SotC hack: The third time you invoke an Aspect, you must change or discard it.<br/><br/>--Paul</blockquote>\nThis is white hot and negates my only problem with Aspects as written in FATE, is that they are static and there is no system for changing them.<br/><br/>That is neat.<br/><br/>Thanks, Paul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133893/#Comment_133893" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T22:48:09+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2008 10:48PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>Which inspired this SotC hack: The third time you invoke an Aspect, you must change or discard it.</blockquote>\nGiven the weight Aspects have on suggested campaign prep, I think that could go too far in the other directly.

After thinking about it, I realized that as cool and dynamic as this sounded, some aspects may be foundational to my character concept. So, I think I want to be able to buy off your compel if I feel strongly enough. Which would mean that you had to offer me a fate point to change my aspect and if I don't want to, I gotta pay a fate point. Of course, if you really feel strongly that the aspect should go, you can always up your ante.

My problem is that Aspects are about front-loading the character with expectations such that a large enjoyment of play is seeing those expectations played out.  For example, if I have the aspect, "There's always a Dame...." as soon as the GM has "The Dame" show up everyone at the table turns to me nodding and smiling knowing full well what's about to happen.  I don't particularly enjoy that Front Loaded Expectations yields Celebrated Realization of those Expectations style of play.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133906/#Comment_133906" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T23:57:58+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 11:57PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2008 11:59PM by Denys.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite></blockquote>\nHmm, maybe as a middle ground: after an adventure, your character's most-used Aspect must shift or be discarded for a wholly new idea.

Paul's suggestion is very interesting for one-shot play though I think it becomes Schizo: the Role-Play Game as there needs to be rhyme and reason why an aspect change is happening.  Scrips in Full Light Full Steam offers a methodology.  Of course there are far fewer "aspect" buttons to push there.  If folks are changing aspects at the third use, pretty much all the responsibility for compelling will fall on them as it becomes a book-keeping tragedy for the GM to keep track of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133931/#Comment_133931" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T06:01:53+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  6:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks,<br/><br/>You can change the aspect in a subtle manner.<br/><br/>So, if you have The Sword of St. George for one Aspect and you use it three times, it can become, I am a slave to the sword, because in play it came up that the sword was sentient and then The Sword Breaks or I Break and finally, My Body is My Weapon once you break free of it.<br/><br/>It depicts an arc, not just randomly chosen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133933/#Comment_133933" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T06:19:46+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  6:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Judd on this one.

Instead of keeping the FATE point, he crosses off a box next to the Aspect. The amount of investment determines the size of bonus for activating the Aspect--say, 1pt=+1, 2pt = +2, 4 = +3, 8 = +4. The player can choose to cash in the accumulated investment and get a surge of FATE points that all have to be used or discarded by the end of the scene.

You can write it right then if it's a consequence of the selloff, or you can write it in later when it would be convenient to you, or you can write it in at the end of the session when you have time to think of it.<br/><br/>Hell, given a little more tweaking, you could more or less toss the dice and make play into an unending chain of making your aspects explode in awesome.

What happens to them?</blockquote>\nInteresting, for those Aspects that are tied to other characters ("Sally, save me!").  That said, what happened in the novels is in the past -- character's aren't retroactively changing here, they're growing.<br/><br/>Overall, my concern with the idea is that forced, on-the-spot character change mandated by mechanics sounds like a recipe for disaster:<br/>* Forced: if I have an Aspect that I <i>really really</i> like, I'm now encouraged to *not* use it.<br/>* On-the-spot: It may make no sense to change an Aspect in the middle of a fight, or the story might not really clearly tell you how it should change.<br/>* Mechanically-mandated:  It's change for change's sake, not change for the sake of the character or the story.  Isn't that just as problematic as static Aspects?<br/><br/>Now, sure, this could be *fun*.  And don't worry John, I'm not saying Judd's wrong -- I burned out that aspect already. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  But <i>if I were to do this in my game</i>, I would consider the following:<br/>* Make it not something that's forced, but chosen...with a hell of a benefit.  Want a +4 (or maybe +5) instead of the +2 or reroll?  Cool -- that Aspect is Done.  You've burned it out, and you'll dramatically change it later.  (Yes, this comes with its own problems.  I would try to solve them if I actually implemented this.)  (Edit: And that's exactly what Rob suggested above.  Heh.)<br/>* Make it so that the on-the-spot factor is mitigated.  If you have a good idea Right Now, do it Right Now.  Otherwise, after this scene is over, that Aspect is in limbo until you change it.  (If you like, call it a "We Owe Change" list.)<br/>* Make it so the mechanics work as flags, not mandates.  After every session, look at the Aspects with the most checks, and talk about if they've changed or not.  Why mechanically mandate when you have something at your disposal so much more awesome than cold mechanics: smart, creative people.<br/>These aren't necessarily mutually compatible ideas, just something I chewed on over lunch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134126/#Comment_134126" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:33:36+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:33PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about tying fate point refreshes to aspect changes?<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce a session, you may get a full refresh by changing an aspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134130/#Comment_134130" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:35:11+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:35PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: oliof</cite>How about tying fate point refreshes to aspect changes?<br><br>Once a session, you may get a full refresh by changing an aspect.</br></br></blockquote>\nI like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134221/#Comment_134221" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T18:04:47+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  6:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>If you discard, how about the character gains one of those FATE "potential" Aspects or the like.

That happens between stories or in down time, and can happen at a whim. But instead the difference is the idea of forcing an Aspect change/removal or doing so in the middle of a story for a benefit.  Regardless, I think keeping in mind the changing Aspects to happen based on previous actions, is a nice enough tweak (or at least different way to frame it) than what the book outlines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134251/#Comment_134251" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T21:46:07+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  9:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Judd is totally right.

This is the Heart of your character. It is something your character will protect whether their lover, their child, their status within a hierarchy, their sense of themselves, or something else. It is also something the player should be willing to have threatened by the GM in the form of NPCs and events in the game world, and perhaps even lose.

I like the overall idea and I think a lot of players would - I just couldn't figure out exactly how I wanted to handle it.<br/><br/>Ultimately, each of the players chose several Aspects that they view as important to their character concept and they are changing them when it seems warranted by in-game actions and choices - nothing concretely defined for how or when they change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134287/#Comment_134287" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T06:14:38+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  6:14AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About the "disappearing" aspects problem: just have them NOT disappear. Strike them to remind you and the GM they cannot be compelled/invoked anymore, but they are the written legacy of your character past and evolution. It would make no sense to simply erase them altogether.<br/><br/>In the long run, transfer the old aspects to the back of the charsheet, or something (maybe a diary or journal of the character's adventures).<br/><br/>This way the other characters linked aspects will still make sense <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134346/#Comment_134346" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T10:08:27+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 10:08AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be more interested in having aspects rotate within the space of a session than disappear.<br/><br/>I'm finding that some players figure out "go to" aspects they can always use in common situations. Frex, I have a PC in my game with the aspect "Hondo needs me" (Hondo being another PC). Whenever the group gets involved in combat, that aspect is a bit too convenient and gets played round after round. I'd rather encourage a bit of variety.<br/><br/>The idea of making characters evolve is one I am less fond of. Especially at the rate I am seeing prescribed here. I also don't like the idea of a lot of tracking. Maybe at the end of a session, the GM can nominate one aspect on each character sheet for retirement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134374/#Comment_134374" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T11:16:09+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 11:16AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Overall, my concern with the idea is that forced, on-the-spot character change mandated by mechanics sounds like a recipe for disaster:<br/>* Forced: if I have an Aspect that I<i>really really</i>like, I'm now encouraged to *not* use it.<br/>* On-the-spot: It may make no sense to change an Aspect in the middle of a fight, or the story might not really clearly tell you how it should change.<br/>* Mechanically-mandated:  It's change for change's sake, not change for the sake of the character or the story.  Isn't that just as problematic as static Aspects?</blockquote>\nI missed this yesterday, but waiting for the train today, point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> struck me too.  I really don't like that, although I would echo that it might work well for one shots and con games.<br/><br/>For your other two points I would say that I think in play players and GMs will easily be able to make it make sense, and make the change be for the sake of character or the story. And if it feels wrong, like Indiana Jones losing his Bullwhip Aspect at this point in time doesn't really have any resonance, then the player has a reason not to invoke it.
