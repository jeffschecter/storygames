I'm very interested to see how the relationship map works, and how the mechanics work in play. The game is a fascinating remix of traditional gm'ing with lots of flags, conflict resolution &amp; stakes setting, shared narration of outcomes and all that good stuff. I'm intrigued and am doing research for working with relationship maps and relationships as resources. We'll start with the Pathways chart and make a fresh world with our own newly created characters to run.<br/><br/>I've got some shout outs for prep materials that are being very helpful. And a few questions for folks who may have played. Jenskot's <a href="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/Smallville_Cheat_Sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">cheat sheet</a> is teaching me how to play right along with the book. I feel much more confident heading into the session that I would without it. The Pathways table itself from the book is, I anticipate, going to be a clear and really interesting tool to use.  I'm planning to make extra copies of JD Corley's <a href="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/gaming/cheatsheets/scheat1.pdf" rel="nofollow">cheat sheet</a> and hand them out to the players. I think that will decentralize the rules well, and let folks inclined to imbibe the system quickly to help keep me on the up and up. The two flow charts JDC came up with for <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tN6s7kVsp4bPw4uLM1DXCjvkK_1z8qEQH5nnd8N2xH8/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CL7fypAK" rel="nofollow">conflicts</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1YFqao39Nhf7jGdvhiJHowkMq-ul9FKrUHhW-uJruAo0/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CIjMsqcI" rel="nofollow">rolling</a> also look useful. <br/><br/>So, I'm going to keep it to 2-3 players plus me to keep our relationship maps tight. I'm hoping we will get to play some the same night that we make the characters and world. Am I dreaming? We'll have 4 hours. Have other folks made series from scratch? Does it help to do brainstorming for the world &amp; community first? Or villains &amp; types of crime? I'm planning to make Features using the Pathways chart (it sounds fun). This might fill in some of those gaps. Veterans vs Rookies? Moving ahead to get a handle on how the Watchtower is meant to handle the plot, any advice or stories from creating Wedges and handling Features would be great.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358392/#Comment_358392" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T18:07:32+00:00" title="February  8, 2012  6:07PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I've not run it much, but here's the biggest thing for me: <strong>the dice don't resolve stakes</strong>.

It took several read throughs for the implications of the way the mechanics work to sink in. Active player takes a stand, Reactive gives or opposes and rolls.

Well, we started character generation, and got about two steps along the path. We're going to start over because a) one player had a last minute work emergency (she encouraged us to start without her, not wanting the game to have to be called off) and b) we got some stuff wrong. <br/><br/>A couple of things were annoying. Neither of these is a huge deal, and I noticed neither when I fell in love with the game on first reading it, over a year ago. But, this is the sort of thing that just doesn't come up until one starts playing:<br/><br/>1. PDF pages taking a long time to load on my nook. Most things I look at these days don't take as long per page as Smallville. This meant that our one copy of the physical book wasn't enough. Purely a technical issue, and one I expect to get less common. Five years ago, I'd never have believed I'd be reading whole books on an ebook reader.<br/><br/>2. Getting confused by the terminology. Oh, it's all there, but not all in the same place, and there's no index, and we only had one copy of the book.  But as we were going along the paths, we kept having to stop. "Wait, what's a Heritage? I don't see that in the earlier section." "Checking the -- oh, there isn't an index." "Wait, what's a Resource again? Is there a cheat sheet for this?" The cheat sheets would have helped here.<br/><br/>We're going to do this from scratch, likely via email, as Intercon L is RealSoon, and some of us are frantically working on our games for it. I've got the corebook and the yearbook. Watchtower Report is only available as PDF at the moment, correct?<br/><br/>I've got the links to the cheat sheets -- these are really useful! Jenskot's is almost exactly what I need, only leaving out the definition of Heritage. That term seems to slip through the cracks despite being referenced in the Pathways.<br/><br/>We have five people total, and I think we're all going to create a Lead. I'm kind of hoping not to be the Watchtower all the time. We're doing a near future NYC setting. Oddly, I think the email will make it easier to deal with waiting for everyone to catch up at each step, as there's always someone ready way faster than everyone else, and someone ready way slower. But, I do hope we'll be able to do face to face game sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358431/#Comment_358431" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T02:20:55+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  2:20AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I found the terminology confusing too. <br/><br/>I also wrote a couple of cheat sheets: one for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LEEnQl7vml0AYf1N0jT0H-2N9w1WlQwMTbKUc2-hI7Y/edit?hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow">assembling and rolling a pool</a> and another <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JGh1eNcGlunFtY4himNpJii9HY8bo2Ge9kJ-YTE_Wkc/edit?hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow">Conflict summary flowchart</a>.<br/><br/>But stick with it!

From what I've seen so far, The upcoming Marvel game continues this trend, great mechanics, and ever improving (easier to use) text. <br/><br/>Positive Comment:<br/><br/>Challenging Values and Relationships is easily my favorite part of Smallville! It's like real time Flag / Belief / Key management. I find many people don't really know what kind of character they want to play till they start playing. Which in the case of Smallville means you may start with Values and Relationships you find you don't care about as is. So challenge them! You get rewarded immediately for telling everyone at the table what you care about now. Love it!<br/><br/>Note: <br/><br/>Smallville is a testament to "design matters". It's designed to emulate Smallville the TV show which sometimes trips people up. Some of the people I know who didn't enjoy playing Smallville also don't enjoy the Smallville TV show (or soap operas). Their specific dissatisfaction is actually a thumbs up to the game design! <br/><br/>Conflict &amp; Stakes don't work how you might expect. It's best to go in with minimal to no expectations. Conflicts emulate soap operas where a lot of conflict doesn't really resolve the issue at hand but instead focuses on the characters hurting each other, expanding how they know each other, and exploring how they feel about each other now. The resolution systems also dissuades murder, which I like!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358489/#Comment_358489" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T10:14:47+00:00" title="February  9, 2012 10:14AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, Relationships are awesome.

In this case, the general goal is "Bob enters the cave" and the specific goal is "Dave lets Bob into the cave." If Dave Gives, Bob gets both of them: Dave stands to one side and allows Bob to enter the cave. If Dave loses and takes Stress, then Bob gets the general win but not the specific: Bob is able somehow to force his way past Dave's active but ultimately ineffectual resistance.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: avram</cite><strong>What if only one person wants something?</strong>If the Reacting player rolls higher, they swap roles, and the Reactor becomes the Acting player.

Step one is very important, both sides must clearly state <i>what they want the other side to do</i> first thing.  This can be as simple as "stop doing that crazy thing" or "leave."  But it has to involve the other person doing something.  So when Bob's player says "I want Dave to let me into the cave."  Dave's player should immediately say "I want Bob to give up on trying to get into the cave."  before anyone thinks about grabbing dice.  If it's not clear whether Bob can get into the cave on his own (it's a booby trapped cave) then it's a Test and Bob's player can ask for things that don't involve other characters.<br/><br/>It's a little weird to get your head around.  Most people think "I'm beat them, so I should get my Goal."  The best thing the dice can force is "I'm better than them, so they get (taken) out of my way."  If you actually want to achieve your Goal, you have to size it correctly so that they'd rather Give In to it than miss the rest of the scene and limp off a d12 Stress.  Unfortunately, I think Stress is incentivized a little too much, so the sweet spot of "not as bad as Stressed out" is pretty narrow and sometimes nonexistent.<br/><br/>Our first few Contests were big, kind of out of character for the target, Goals ("Your bookworm joins the football team with me!") All ended in one side Stressed Out.  The players were frustrated at first, because it felt like they couldn't achieve their Goals.  We never did quite find the sweet spot, but we could see it.<br/><br/>The one rule we overlooked that might have smoothed this out some is that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">choose</span> whether to Stress someone out if you win by 5.  You can just win and inflict Stress as normal.  We had lots of crying fits and storming off in the middle of scenes over seemingly trivial stuff before I found that.  If it's a talking Scene, you probably don't want to go stressing out the other side unless the conversation is over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358661/#Comment_358661" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T09:29:14+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  9:29AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What CY said! <br/><br/>You don't have to Stress Out the target. Instead you can just inflict Stress which still ends the contest but it's possible to continue soon after. Although the book is clear that when a contest ends, even if the issue isn't resolved, it's a cue to turn to the players who weren't involved (regardless if they are in the same scene or not) and ask them what they want to do now. Essentially a contest end is a cue to pass the spotlight. <br/><br/>Emergent behavior I've seen occur is people start to telegraph intents that they can win if they are alone. So that way the can get what they want, even when they Stress Out someone. That said, the goals need to be about their Relationships or Values.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358719/#Comment_358719" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T12:28:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2012 12:28PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So what I think I'm hearing is that in <em>Smallville</em>, getting what you want isn't as important as getting the opponent to let you have what you want, possibly because that makes it more likely that your relationship with that opponent will develop in some interesting way.

Most skill rolls in most other games are actually Tests, not Contests.<br/><br/>If you want to do something, and another Feature wants to stop you, there are two possible ways for you to get what you want via a Contest (i.e. without talking them into stopping via roleplay, possibly after racking up some Stress):<br/>--Stress the Feature interfering out, then do what you want (which may still involve a Test) -or-<br/>--State a Goal that involves them stopping their interference AND get them to Give In to the conflict.<br/><br/>If you want another Feature to do something, there's only one possible way to get it via Contest:<br/>--State a Goal that they do the thing you want AND get them to Give In to the conflict.<br/>You absolutely cannot, no matter how many dice you have, get another Feature to do something they're dead set against, EXCEPT for take Stress or get Stressed Out.
