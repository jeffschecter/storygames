In the game designer challenge thread, DirkGently a/k/a Adam Rappold posted a pretty lame challenge. He got called on it and tried to cover up for his lameness by issuing off-handedly suggesting a duel. Well, naturally I couldn't let that go, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2889&amp;page=1#Item_22" rel="nofollow">so I challenged him to a formal game design duel</a>. We hammered out the particulars; Moderator Graham solicited and decided on the particulars and announced them <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2900&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>.<br/><br/>I'm going to be posting regularly to this thread as an ongoing insight to the design of the game. I must say that my initial inclination was correct: Designing under a head-to-head competitive system is vastly different than any other method I've ever engaged in. For starters, there is a significantly greater level of time pressure. This may seem counterintuitive because we have one month for design, compared to Game Chef's two weeks. The difference of course is that in GC the deadline is purely temporal. In this challenge, there is a racing element. I don't just have to finish by the deadline, but I must also stake out my ideas before my opponent.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

This procedure is normally broken down temporally at about 20%-60%-20%, which is to say I spend a bit of time researching the topic, a lot of time thinking about things, and another bit at the end doing the actual writing. I do almost all of my thinking before I first put pen to page (or more accurately finger to keyboard). By the time I get to the actual writing, it usually just pours out. That's the process I've used with MacGuffin.<br/><br/>Research involved (as it almost always does) a quick stop at Wikipedia followed by a lot of general surfing. In this particular case, I was most concerned about the musical scale mechanic requirement. I actually had some immediate ideas about how to use it, but the Wiki article makes it seem much more technical than my initial impressions. I enjoy music, but I don't know the first thing about musical theory. In the end, I've resigned myself to using it more generally, most likely in the form of sheet music. More on that later.<br/><br/>Research on film noir was eminently more enjoyable. I read up on the genre generally, refreshed my memory on a lot of the movies themselves (and surprised myself at the number I'd actually seen), flipped through a lot of evocative movie posters, and found a kick-ass column by Roger Ebert.<br/><br/>All the while, the subconscious is sorting through ideas for how the game will work. Ideas bubble up and get discarded or scribbled down.<br/><br/>Initial thoughts: GMless definitely, choose-your-own-sheet-music as a resolution mechanic/character sheet if doable, resolution based on the rank of notes, a scene for each line of the sheet music, etc.<br/><br/>Then, finally, a title. The travel element (easily the most overlooked of the three) means the characters will have to be doing a little globe-hopping. But why? Of course, a staple of film noir is the thing the characters care very much about but which is ultimately just the catalyst/impetus for their actions: the MacGuffin. Bonus, the MacGuffin is a great bit of film color and makes for a spiffy title.<br/><br/>We're rolling now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Would you mind elaborating a bit on what you are planning with this or is it still in the gestation phase?<br/><br/>Also, as a P.S. I really like the idea of using the "Maltese Falcon" as this basis for your travel element (MacGuffin indeed).

These should ideally be from an appropriate movie songbook, natch. Each line (I'm sure that's not the technical term) represents one locale. So, the first line might represent Istanbul; the second line might represent Leningrad; etc. When a conflict arises at that locale each player involved circles one of the notes; the players reveal their selected notes; the player with the highest note wins the conflict; the players cross off that note; they cannot use it again. In essence, comparing to say d20, this is the equivalent of having a list of d20 results on a sheet of paper and allowing the player to choose what results he wants to use for which conflicts. This naturally brings resource management into play, which is something I've been interested in for rpgs for awhile.<br/><br/>I've got some other ideas flowing from the sheet music concept, such as invoking a word or phrase from the lyrics for a bonus. E.g., one player is using "As Time Goes By" from <i>Casablanca</i>. In a conflict involving two lovers, the player invokes the lyric "woman needs man and man must have his mate" to get, say, a 2-step bump on the chosen note. Of course, he now crosses off that lyric and can't use it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66373/#Comment_66373" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T11:49:24+00:00" title="May  1, 2007 11:49AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow... that is really cool (I especially like the resource management bit).

Remember that songs from that time will have a particular structure: they'll start off with a verse, often long and rambling, before kicking into the chorus; then back to a shorter verse, then back to the chorus.

It can't just be a substitute for dice. So, I'm onto something. As we know, sheet music contains many other curious little marks beyond the notes themselves. These marks will serve as "props" in the game with mechanical (though not always significant) implications. For example, a particular kind of ornament, e.g., a trill, might represent a cigarette and allow the player to call a "time-out" before proceeding. He strikes out the trill so he can't use it again. Likewise, a staccato mark might be a bullet and allow the player to eliminate an NPC with violence. A rest might be a fedora and allow the player to avoid a confrontation with subterfuge. Etc., etc.<br/><br/>I've also narrowed in on how the staves will be used to organize scene structure. Having decided on using the sheet music, I'm going to squeeze every drop of marrow from it. Sheet music is highly organized. Taking a cue from Burning Empires, I'm leaning toward a highly formalized structure for the game as well. E.g., the first staff represents the meet, where all the PCs first meet; the second staff represents the trail, where the PCs gain information about the location of the MacGuffin; the third staff represents, the dead end, where the PCs go down the wrong path; etc., etc. This culminates with the last staff, where the MacGuffin is finally within reach. All of the results from the prior locales will build resources and contribute to positioning for the final locale.<br/><br/>And, yes, there will be a winner, who gets to narrate the epilogue as his chosen song plays on the CD player behind him.<br/><br/>Very happy with these breakthoughs; I loves me my thinkin' walks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

It will include, obviously, the nature of the MacGuffin, e.g., the Papers, the Jewels, the Maltese Peregrine, etc. It will also include, as the first part of chargen, each character writing down why they desire it, e.g., to avoid being killed by the Fat Man, because I never give up on a case once I take it on, because I need the money to bury my husband, etc. I'm also toying with ways for the players, in game, to learn the secrets of the other characters. This might be as simple as "winning" a locale or might involve another musical mark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66954/#Comment_66954" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T13:37:37+00:00" title="May  4, 2007  1:37PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... I am definitely digging how you are developing the sheet music idea. Of course, I am digging it mostly because with each post you only underline how dominant my lead has become! <br/><br/>With that being said, I am very curious at how you are going to flesh all of that out mechanically (namely how players determine marks and effects... unless certain marks will always mean certain things). My suggestion would be to create and allocate the pool of effects first (say a stack of index cards) and then let the players assign them to the squigglies on their character sheet (along with giving them some Noir sensibility). Consider that bit of fried gold a freebie... an act of pity on my part, if you will.<br/><br/>In terms of using 'Motivations' to tie the characters to the MacGuffin... I think that you should also strongly consider giving players a 'tie' to each other as well. Every player could be required to write some shadowy connection between his character and the character of the player on his right. I think that this could prove to spice up the 'chase' by adding some personal drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.
