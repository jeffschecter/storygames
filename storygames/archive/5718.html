Like, there are some games that use dice for conflict resolution and some use cards. <i>Dust Devils</i> is awesome in that it uses a poker hand. <i>Mortal Coil</i> has stat + tokens. But if the stats were removed, it's just as possible to use tokens only. Enter the poker chips.<br/>\n<br/>\nA player creates a character, say ... presenting the DM/GM/Guide/ST/what-have-you with a concept of five or so Traits. Basically, the player says his/her/its character is Cool because it can do X Cool Things. The player also determines how Awesome the character is by setting an Awesome Pool. We'll use 100 for the sake of this example, perhaps because the player likes percentiles. The GM receives a similar pool for conflict, much like <i>Beast Hunter</i>'s Adversity. The player decides how to divvy those 100 Awesome Tokens - say there are denominations of 1, 10 and 20. A player could take 5 20s, so his/her/its character is Really, Really Awesome in very specific circumstances or parse it into 100 1s for the more exacting and calculating types. There's the typical scene framing and the like, and the GM can generate conflict by investing X amount from the Adversity Pool that must be matched by the player.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me that even matches fail when the player has 100 1s vs. 100 GM tokens ... I'll have to think about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it's just a random thought that popped into my head. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Quick character creation, easy resolution, not confined by setting and extremely portable as determined by how much loose change is in the player's pocket. Unless someone brought a stack of poker chips. Pringles could work over lunch, too. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HDTVDinner" title="HDTVDinner"><img alt="HDTVDinner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HDTVDinner">HDTVDinner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127776/#Comment_127776" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T14:50:51+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  2:50PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really love the resource management style of play, and have thought over mechanics a few times, but could never get anything to stick. You may try having "Levels" of abilities Like for instance a wizard type could have a 10 point "Magic missle" type spell, a 20 point "Fireball", and a 25 point "death ray". The condition would be in order for the character to use the ability, he would lose that amount of points for the conflict. but regain them once the conflict is over. The character would also be able to raise the points used up to double the original cost to increase it's effectiveness. You compare points to his target and higher wins. divide the margin of success by 5, round accordingly, and that many points are permenantly lost. You could also have some passive type stuff, like say he has a ring that absorbs damage. At character creation he could spend 5 points for every 1 point of protection, so he could spend 25 points to be able to subtract 5 from any attempts at causing him damage. Doing this the character would only have 75 points to play with for conflicts, unless he takes a negative trait like "Fell out of an ugly tree" Add fifteen to opponents point totals for any social contests, and add 5 awesome points to your pool. Negative traits would not count towards your characters total of good traits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127853/#Comment_127853" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T19:38:36+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  7:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/1984_Prime.pdf" rel="nofollow">1984 Prime</a> uses a poker chip mechanic to quite good effect.
