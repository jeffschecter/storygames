It modifies several GM principles, and a lot of the core moves. It runs fairly damn quickly! Most adventures are deliberately short, but can grow and easily form the start of a campaign, or fit into an existing one.<br/><br/>Pirate World has tons of other stuff! Like chapters on the new Hirelings, new Backgrounds (customise your character at level 1), playbooks (9! Including the Brute, Pirate, Fanatic, Reefmonger...). I'd love to try a PBP game here testing all the new stuff.<br/><br/>Here's the kickstarter, currently at 400%:<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2041872302/pirate-world-the-explosive-dungeon-world-fate-sour" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2041872302/pirate-world-the-explosive-dungeon-world-fate-sour</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
