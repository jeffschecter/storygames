                    Since I know of only one person who both reads posts on Story Games and who actually attended my little house con, <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/175014.html" rel="nofollow">AdamCon</a> this past weekend, you might think this thread has a limited audience; but nay! I suspect I will have things to say that resonate with many of you.<br/><br/><b>Some gamers are sociopaths.</b> At least the ones I know are. I ran a Dogs game on Friday, and one of the players (who is an EMT for a living, no less), solved all his problems by shooting people in the face. I pushed a bit to see how far it would go. Would he shoot the possessed 5 year-old who picked up a gun and shot at the Dogs? Yep. Would he still shoot when the real sorcerer died and the kid was released and was just scared and dropped the gun on the floor? Yep. Even when the kid was crying, "Please! I'm scared! Don't shoot me! I didn't mean to hurt anyone!"? Yep. Did the other Dogs approve? One did, but the other two didn't. Did the other two intervene though? Nope.<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D is more fun when you level faster.</b> Fuck this one level per 13 encounters shit in the rulebooks: triple the XP you give your players. They'll be level 4 by the end of a 5 hour game session. It's tremendous fun. <br/><br/><b>D&amp;D is more fun if you aggressively frame PCs into the action.</b> Get them to the fun decision-making stuff as fast as possible. Don't turn equipment purchasing into a huge ordeal of painful haggling "role-play." They have the equipment list. That's good enough. Don't let them dither about whether to take the left or right corridor. How do they know where to go anyway? I say just stick a map in front of them and let them say, "What's here?" They can point to a secret door and say, "I roll my Search to try to find this door." I didn't all of these things at my D&amp;D game on Saturday, but I should have.<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D is more fun when someone's character dies.</b> There, I said it. Stop being a pussy and kill some PCs, you happy hippie Dungeon Masters! That doesn't mean cheat. That doesn't mean stack things against the players. It means let the players make mistakes and get their PCs killed and stop rescuing them from their mistakes. D&amp;D (3rd Ed.) is about making strategic and tactical decisions and enjoying (or suffering) the consequences. Don't interfere when the consequences suck. They can make up a new character. And, if you're tripling XP, they'll be caught up to the rest of the group in, like, thirty minutes.<br/><br/><b>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</b> can handle a lot of players. I've played in two games now with more players than I'd dare attempt in a modern D&amp;D game (12 the first time, and like 8-9 this past Sunday). It's slow but it's still hella fun. You're not going to get through all six events in a four-hour, or even six-hour, session, but you might complete two or three and the game play is effectively the same. If you want to speed it up a bit, rule that only N number of the players can have their own scenes in each event, but everyone can get involved in each scene. <br/><br/><b>Verge might actually rock.</b> I playtested the <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/index.php/Verge_Reprogrammed" rel="nofollow">new rules</a> on Saturday and it didn't explode. The network-creation rules are fun enough to play by themselves, but they're not a role-playing game (or even a "story game"); they're a setting-creation toy that is amazing fun. If I can roll the role-play procedure into the network-creation rules so it's all one unified system, it will seriously monster rock. We had God as a PC, though he was really an AI who thought he was God -- maybe he really was (we never established the truth and it didn't matter). We had Lucifer as an NPC, a self-proclaimed slut PC screwing everyone including Lucifer and Gideon, an organ-transplanted super holy warrior PC fighting for humanity in a holographic reality. We had the CIO of Megasoft trying to screw the aforementioned slut, who was supposedly his wife, out of her alimony and child support. We had a televangelist with split personalities who believed they were God and Lucifer. We had a scene where Gideon stormed the set of the 700 Club but got leg-pressed through a wall by Pat Robertson. <i>Most amazingly, the players created this insane world themselves, through the network-creation rules!</i><br/><br/><b>Gaming with your friends for three days straight is fun.</b> But you already knew that. It's exhausting, too. You knew that, as well.                </div>

Holy crap, Adam!  I thought hard about splitting into two tables when I had eight.  You're the man now, dog.                        </div>
