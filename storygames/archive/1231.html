<p>What's the best techniques for transitioning smoothly from free narration &amp; roleplay into the structured/mechanical narration in conflict resolution? This came up for me a little bit in Dogs in the Vineyard, and also last night in Dust Devils.

                            The secret is to integrate the dice into play.<br/><br/>Here's an exercise: Play one game of Dogs where EVERY interaction must be in the context of the conflict mechanic, part of a see-and-raise.  It's not easy at first but it can be done.  Sometimes the stakes get kind of silly, but it trains you to look at every interaction as a possible diced conflict.  Once it becomes second nature to pull out the dice, the "bump" won't seem so jarring.                        </div>

                            Hi Dev, <br/><br/>How do you mean "slick"?   In terms of straight play, I really like Trollbabe's "I want a conflict!" that anyone at the table can declare.  That is painless and easy.  Or do you mean a natural transition, like Polaris' key phrases?  Maybe for Dogs you could use a phrase like, "The King has something to say about that" or "I hear the sound of Judgement on the horizen" as the key phrase to everyone to pull out the dice.                        </div>

At what point are you actually pulling out the dice?  In my group, I reach for the dice as soon as I see a conflict coming and intent can be formulated.  This is generally pretty early, rather than later, in a scene.  All the role-play ends up being in the context of Sees and Raises.  I try not to actually bump right up against the conflict before engaging the mechanics.  Like driving a car, I attempt to shift into that before there are so many RPMs that it becomes jarring.                        </div>

It sounds like that's exactly what Dev did.  The issue is that even though the procedure was clear, the transition was jarring.  i.e. Stuff was flying along and then suddenly the fiction stops for a time while you break out the dice, decide what traits apply, roll everything, and so forth.  This came up in Dogs for me because there resolution is always a long procedure -- i.e. you never have a quick single roll like you can in some other systems.  I noticed this particularly at convention games (but also in home games) when time is short.  So, for example, we're close to the end of our time and one Dog is on her own and encounters trouble.                        </div>

                            I have very different oppionion.<br/><br/>Very smooth to me seems Nobilis. The trick is, that there are miracles, which I can do without spending resources, and more difficult ones reqiure Miracle Points. If I'm the Regal of Fire (= Domain 5), I know, I can create fire, destroy fire, understand fire, etc., whenever I want. Only when I want to fire to something supernatural, like creating a bridge of fire, or when I need a fire comparable to an atomic bomb, I have to spend MP.<br/><br/>The trick is to have a clear point, where the rules absolutely require you to use the mechanic. If every player understand where this point is, transition will come most smoothly, because there is no need to communicate the transition.                        </div>

<p>For the sake of argument, let's stick to Dust Devils (because you can't really do the thing with Dogs, where absolutely every interaction is a piece of the conflict), and let me give you a script of how it went down:</p>
<ul>
<li>PC: "Look preacher, there's no need to get sore! We'll go down to the general store and sort this keruffle right out.." [She's playing up to her reputation as being silver-toungued.]</li>
<li>GM: "Are you trying to bullshit me, deputy? Because I've listened to you before and it's only given me grief." [I'm looking to push back at her skills &amp; control of the situation.]</li>
<li>PC: "Would I bullshit you? Hell no - I'd never think to lie to a man of the cloth."</li>
<li>GM: "I think you should stop wasting my time."</li>
<li><em>then, a pause, we're both looking half the cards and chips askance, and then...</em></li>
<li>GM: Okay, so... so how about the preacher is trying to slam the door hard in your face, totally show you you're not the boss of him. What are you going to do?</li>
<li><em>and mechanical resolution follows...</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm trying to get rid of that pause. Part of the reason that's there is because I'm looking for player cues that this is a conflict that they're bought into. I don't want to force them into a conflict of "Do I force the Preacher to back down?" if the player herself is willing to just run off the porch and leave him alone. This happened a few times in Dogs: I said that convincing this person would require a conflict, and players sometimes decided at that point to just take their character and leave, and deal with that person later. This matters perhaps more in Dust Devils, because almost any conflict could be <em>the one that knocks you out into the Endgame</em>.</p>
<p>Is this more clear?</p>

<p>So, looking at the script: it could be I need to break out and explicitly say "obstacle X / person Y isn't going to budge unless you're ready to go to a conflict" - I'm not going to try and avoid that altogether - but I perhaps need to say that a bit earlier, perhaps about two lines earlier than I did. If the player wants to back down at that point, we resume freeplay, with her working her choice in to her narration.</p>
<p>But: figuring out <em>when</em> it's just right to break that down is still hard to get right, and so far I've been throwing it out a bit late, relatively speaking.</p>

                            In terms of making the transition to conflict seamless, I've always just stolen from TSoY: your last sentence of free narration is the first element of the conflict.<br/><br/>In Dogs, there is a certain amount of driving-stick feeling to that.  If you start a conflict late, you give up a whole bunch of raises and sees for free.  But there's nothing wrong with rolling up your Stats as you say "Brother Methuselah, I think you have enough wives."<br/><br/>Of course, I don't really hold with ritualized game phrases too much.  I think you can say an awful lot just by picking up dice and rolling them.                        </div>

                            Hey Dev,<br/><br/>This was part of my experience with "floaty" play when someone I know ran Dogs in the Vineyard.  He came from a mostly Call of Cthulhu/Unknown Armies "avoid the dice" kind history, and we'd find lots of verbal sparring and blocking which was really frustrating to me, because Dogs relies strongly on "Say yes or roll the dice" to prevent blocking. <br/><br/>I usually look at a situation like that and ask the player, "Do you want to make that a conflict?" and take the last exchange as the initial raise/see or whatever fits the game.  And, if the player says no, I usually cut the scene, since it's clear it's not going to really go anywhere.  It's a good way to avoid falling into the classic "party argument" habits from games without social resolution.<br/><br/>Usually, I find if someone isn't willing to cut the scene, <i>but also</i> unwilling to engage system, it's often a habit picked up from avoiding system, and they will often try to smooze or use force of personality to get what they want.  They want something, but they're not willing to put the money on the table, as it were.                        </div>

                            Couldn't scene framing and PTA-style scene agendas help with this? The player gives a general goal (which should work in a conflict-resolution/Stakes way as well) and the scene is framed to open right on the conflict. Once the conflict is resolved you go back and the scene is reframed ready for the next conflict or closed and the next scene agenda made.<br/><br/>That's how I try to run Dogs, anyway...                        </div>

                            Dev, I would have gone to conflict with "Are you trying to bullshit me, deputy?"  Or at least made that the opening for conflict if the PC chose to pursue it.  Because really, even <em>the preacher character</em> is asking, "Is this a conflict?"<br/><br/>Basically, whenever I feel the first hints of opposition, it's time to call down the dice -- at least when I'm GMing.  Actually, I take that back -- even when I'm playing, the first hint I have of butting heads with an NPC, I break out the dice.<br/><br/>Of course, I usually roleplay with dice in hand...<br/><br/>Also, again, this is dependent on the game.  In <em>PTA</em>, for instance, you go right past the first hints of opposition right up until you don't know what else to say without the resolution telling you who wins.                        </div>

                            Increased familiarity might also help, sometimes as a system becomes more intuitive it becomes less intrusive.<br/><br/>That said, I think the stuff above is worth trying but it may also be that these mechanics just don't work that well for you.  I think Dogs is a great game, but I find the mechanic terribly intrusive and don't really enjoy it for that reason.  That doesn't make it a worse game, just not the right game for me.  Sometimes although we want to like a thing it just isn't quite right for us.<br/><br/>But you're not there yet, I agree with those who were saying the conflict starts when there's any pushback, start rolling the dice as soon as people stop just agreeing.  I also think though that simple practice might make it easier and more intuitive, even if not so much while practising.                        </div>

<p>Practice could be part. I didn't have as rough transitions with Nathan, but he knew what to expect a classically Narr conflict-driven game - he had roughly the same expectations as I did. So maybe this is part of the directions for the newer player: keep looking out for when <em>you</em> want to switch modes and resolve this through the system.</p>
<p>I get what you mean about Dogs, though. I dream about a DitV-like game where you basically <em>always</em> have dice out and ready, rather than requiring a switch of modes, and you can always push dice forward to mechanically back up what you're saying and doing, but you're not always in a strict conflict mode.</p>

Could you not for a session try having dice in hand at all times, and starting putting them down the moment anything becomes at all at issue?<br/><br/>Joshua talks about roleplaying with dice in hand, maybe you should try likewise.  The first time it might be a bit of a fag, but it might help afterwards make that transition more natural.<br/><br/>Dogs isn't like classic games as I'm sure you realise, in many games the intrusion of mechanics is seen as a necessary evil to be minimised where possible, in Dogs the intrusion of mechanics should actively help drive stuff forwards, so one needs (if one wishes to obviously) to unlearn that desire to minimise mechanical impact.<br/><br/>Embrace the dice in other words, get them out at the least provocation and trust the game to make that interesting.                        </div>

                            I think, in some of the conflicts with Katie, you guys did a lot more back-and-forth than you did with either me or Nathan.  Part of that, I think, was that we're used to skipping straight to "okay, here's where I'm not going to budge" whereas Katie is used to roleplaying out extended negotiations.  Dogs is a great example of having both of these happen at the same time because of the way you See &amp; Raise.  Dust Devils doesn't have that, so when you reach for the cards, you're resolving the conflict, and the negotiation aspect gets narrated by a single player, not described by the two of them working together.  That, in my mind, loses some of the fun of playing with other people, because character interactions are hella fun.  Maybe if there was some way to keep the banter going while you drew and re-drew cards, that could stick some of that back in.                        </div>

                            I think Warren and Chris are totally right about scene framing and how this interacts with conflict resolution. The more crisp and targetted your scene framing, the less "wandering around free play" there is, and it's a lot easier to target the conflict and dive right at it. I struggle with this a lot, myself. I have old-skool skills that say, "Let play develop organically, then, when conflict naturally appears, engage the resolution system." This play style <i>can</i> work with a good CR mechanic, but in my experience, a game like Nine Wordls, Dogs, or Dust Devils plays waaaaay better if you play with really sharp and aggressive scene framing.<br/><br/>Think of free-play as this rolling wavefront (this is Ron's analogy, btw). The game rolls along, people say things, the GM cuts from location to location, etc. As you go, conflicts arise and "pop" out of this rolling wavefront of fiction. Then the wavefront has to pause (this is the jarring transition), you have to pick up on the conflict that popped out, take out your dice, etc. Depending on the mechanic, the fiction wave might start up again as you engage the mechanic (like in Dogs) or it may not. Either way, there's a feeling like you have to "get rolling again" and out of the freeze-frame that the conflict put on your wave.<br/><br/>(Quick aside: I've seen some players who get very impatient with this. They sort of bounce in their seat like, "C'mon, c'mon... let's get this over with <i>and get back to the game</i>. When to a player who is used to meaty CR methods, the conflict resolution part <i>is</i> the game. This can lead to some friction.)<br/><br/>Think of scene framing like making a pizza. We make the dough and sauce and put the toppings on and bake it, all so we can eat that pizza with those toppings. Will it be good? Will it be bad? We have to eat it and find out. Making the dough is not eating the pizza, but we have a goal in mind when we're making the dough. We know that soon we will be eating the pizza. Just making dough and slicing pepperoni isn't the point, and we're not going to keep doing that over and over, hoping a pizza will just happen. We have a goal and a method to get there before we even start.<br/><br/>Conflict is eating the pizza. By framing the scene in a way that points to conflict as our goal, then we are already most of the way there. Conflict happens inside the scene, and is relevant to the parameters of the scene -- "the stuff inside the film frame" as Ron likes to say. The <i>specific nature</i> of the conflict might be discovered as the scene develops (like suddenly deciding to add pineapple to your pizza), but conflict with the scene elements is already a target for us when the scene is framed. We don't have to wonder if we're going to eat pizza at all -- that's why we're in the kitchen in the first place.<br/><br/>Those metaphors got stretched a bit, so I hope that all makes sense. "Free play with popping conflicts" is how a lot of my play ends up going, so I sympathize with the transitional gear-grinding issue. There are a few good ways to deal with it, as mentioned in the thread already. But another thing to try is to ditch the idea of free-play completely. Try some hardcore scene-framing, targetted at conflict, embedded in the parameters of the scene. It works like magic in PTA and Dogs, and I imagine the same goes for Dust Devils.                        </div>

                            Something relevant to this and exciting to me is the body of technique in improv (yeah, I know, sorry) for editing scenes.  In our Durham 3 game last week, Remi and I, fresh from our long-form class, were doing lay-ons and walk-ons, which are specific techniques for heightening existing scenes.  There's no gaming vocabulary for signalling "I have a great lay-on!" which threw Clinton, the GM, because we just had to muscle in and do it.<br/><br/>Similarly, there's a whole body of knowledge related to editing scenes - recognizing when a scene is dying and ending it before it does, identifying an interesting bit that could be heightened and expanded by tagging somebody out and having a sub-scene with their partner as a flashback, cross-fading one scene into another gracefully.  It's hot stuff.                        </div>

                            Ah, a form of kibbitzing.  That's not really all that revolutionary, is it?<br/><br/>I'm surprised it threw Clinton, because I can recall doing it to him (and him doing it to me) quite comfortably when we were playing Multiverser run by M.

Try. Some. Those are key words in my post. Is there some actual substance to your responses that I'm missing? I'm trying to take them as something other that argumentative Internet noise, but I'm failing.                        </div>

                            Reading ... charitably ...<br/><br/>I'm writing an essay that hopefully clarifies why this is interesting and perhaps important, so maybe we can talk about it a little later.  We usurped some of his GM power to make it happen, and we didn't have any rules in place about that.  We discuss it in our podcast and also in the Forge AP thread if you are genuinely interested.                        </div>

<p>If I was doing me session again, I'd still loosely (organically?) freeplay some scenes, basically giving the characters some fodder for getting their footing and looking for potential conflicts, then start using more aggressive scene framing once I had some idea of what to frame them into.</p>

<p>Dev,</p>
<p>Smooth transitions never did anyone any good. Please, for me, without warning anyone, frame them a conflict they cannot deny or avoid. Something <em>terrible,</em> in every sense of the world.</p>
