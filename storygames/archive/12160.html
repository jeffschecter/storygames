He also suggests that different places will have different Demographics. Meaning, different categories.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, I'm a citizen in a country that is <i>renowned</i> for its statistics and census. I think we're being very thorough. You can see for yourselves : <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/instrument/3901_Q2_V3-eng.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the form for the 2006 census. It seems we have a law, here, to make us hold a census about every 6 years or so. The next one is planned for 2011. For Marital Status, it'll (probably) have a category for "Legally married to someone of the same sex". And there is talk to change "North American Indian" for "First nation".<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice that the word "Race" never actually comes up. They just ask "is this person..." and then give a number of choices. They are: White, Chinese, South Asian (e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, etc.), Black, Filipino, Latin American, Southeast Asian (e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Malaysian, Laotian, etc.), Arab, West Asian (e.g., Iranian, Afghan, etc.), Korean, Japanese, Other \u2014 Specify.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice also that Aboriginal do not answer that question, they skip it entirely as they have their own questions specific to their status, and that they are themselves broken down into several sub-categories (Inuit, North American Indian, Metis) and they make the distinction whether they are registered and whatnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nA question that is not to be neglected, especially if you live in the province of Qu\xe9bec, is the one about the languages you know. English and/or French. And others. Which did you learn first, which do you use most often at home, which do you use most often at work?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow will this affect play? I'm not sure yet. I would probably add a category for Language, especially in Montreal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I though it was interesting. I offer it to you, hoping you'll find it at least a little interesting as well. I don't know anything about United States census habits, so feel free to bring up comparisons with Canada. Other countries welcome as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272543/#Comment_272543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T00:38:37+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 12:38AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well this will not answer your question (not directly) but the Italian edition has very different tables since the original ones would not make much sense.

The action occurs in "your home town, last week".<br/>\n<br/>\nOne player plays the Investigator.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe others rotates the position of the Authority (GM). When you are not the Authority (and not the Investigator), you are an Advisor. Anyone can narrate anything. The Investigator has jurisdiction ofver the character of the investigator, and the Authority has jurisdiction over everything else. Jurisdiction comes with a right of veto. You can also appeal anything you don't like.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery Characters is described through a set of demographics.<br/>\n<br/>\nSex: Male, Female.<br/>\nAge: Any<br/>\nRace: White, Black, Asian, Latino, Middle Eastern, American Indian, Pacific Islander.<br/>\nClass: Rich, Middle Class, Poor.<br/>\nLegal Status: (Ex-)Convict, Citizen, Private Investigator, Police Officer, Federal Agent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese have no mechanical effect on the game. Conflict resolution is done through a game of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar's_dice" rel="nofollow">Liar's Dice</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it does, is make you take a look at your own judgements and prejudices. At the end of the game, you are asked to place your characters around the board, categorized as Whit/Non-white, and as Rich/Middle Class/Poor. The game itself makes no judgement, it just makes you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is, however, a feature geared towards the United States.It was suggested somewhere (perhaps not in the book, perhaps on a thread, somewhere), that players should adapt the demographic to adapt them to the realities of their country/home town.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm interested in what you have to say about the "methods, ethics and motives of StatsCan".

It's a government-run, thus it's policies are subject to partisan political bickering and  that small mindedness that comes with it. I have a lot of contempt for demography in general, but the work that goes on at StatsCan is tedious and overly bureaucratic - it lacks praxis beyond providing numbers for various medical, financial and administrative institutions. It's ethically irresponsible because these data do a kind of violence to the lived experiences of Canadians; while they have 'scientific' data at their disposal, in my opinion, that flavour of data shouldn't be used for policy decisions. Additionally, statistics can be made to show whatever the fuck you want. "Too many immigrants? Not enough immigrants? What do you want the numbers to say?" &amp;c. Not to mention that the follow-up surveys have some silly and problematic questions on them. <br><br>Honestly, I'm not an expert on StatsCan or the Census.

I'd worry about which of those are a thing in your home town right now.  The American Census categories are useful in this fashion because they weren't created out of anysense of completeness or political correctness.  They were created because they were all "things" (as in "it isn't all that uncommon for someone to get beat up for being one).  Even in America which of these are "things" where you are not only will vary, but it also says something about which "things" you recognize in your town and which you don't.  <br><br>If Seth were to do a new edition I'd encourage him to do more than just add Immigrant to the list.  I'd recommend different "list-of-things-packages" that could be used.  Imagine, for instance where instead of race and age you had sexual orientation and religious practice.  Trying to do ALL would just get confusing.  The nice thing about the limited number is that they can be largely positioned in play on a simple axis which drives home the way we demographically sort people.  But I definitely think there is room to swap other categories to steer the focus elsewhere.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
