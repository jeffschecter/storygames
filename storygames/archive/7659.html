That's not to say that the Producer can't set stakes that benefit or detract from various Protagonists' desires.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>How do you handle narration? Does the person with the highest card get to speak for the other characters? What do they do?</blockquote>\nIt varies, sometimes they do want to speak for other characters, and that's okay, I try to make it more directorial.  "The monster comes in and you screw up because you're too worried about your wife."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>Does the Producer take the lead driving the plot?</blockquote>\nWell, the other players do too when they request a scene Focussed on plot and with Agendas relating to plot, but yes, I often keep track of plot elements and reintroduce them or push the players to address them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>How do you define your stakes? If I win, this happens?</blockquote>\nThat way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Do you describe how you are trying to win the stakes? If yes, at what point in the resolution process do you describe how?</blockquote>\nVirtually always before a conflict is identified, though I have used the step-by-step resolution process to fun effect.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Do you have any house rules for PTA?</blockquote>\nIf the Producer puts the last piece of Budget into a Conflict, it's the last scene in the show, even if some spent fan mail comes back to him. The chips that come back to him go into his Budget for the next episode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170070/#Comment_170070" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T08:08:46+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  8:08AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2008 8:14AM by jessecoombs.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are most of your scenes conflict driven? <br/>No, about one third are.<br/><br/>If a scene doesn't have conflict, what do you do? Push for one? Skip it? Something else? <br/>Just let the scene unfold naturally.<br/><br/>Before you play a scene, do you define the scene's Focus, Agenda, and Location?<br/>Yes.<br/><br/>If not, how do you define a scene before play?<br/>Just like the book says.<br/><br/>Does the Producer have stakes?<br/>Nope, but when I'm the producer my overall goal is to stir shit up.<br/><br/>Can Protagonists have conflicts against each other?<br/>No, I can't figure out a way for that to work with the system.<br/><br/>If yes, can they have Stakes that contradict each other?<br/>How would this work?<br/><br/>If yes, do the Protagonists compare their cards against each other or against the Producer?<br/>I don't drift the rules this far, since I don't think that's the game's intent.<br/><br/>If against the Producer, what happens if both Protagonists beat the Producer?<br/>They both win their stakes.<br/><br/>How do you handle narration? Does the person with the highest card get to speak for the other characters? What do they do?<br/>High card narrates until he or she doesn't want to anymore. And yes, they speak for the characters.  <br/><br/>Does the Producer take the lead driving the plot?<br/>When I produce, I don't have a grand scheme, just things I'd like to do in individual scenes. But I try, and hopefully, so do the players.<br/><br/>How do you define your stakes? If I win, this happens? The stakes are over X? Something else?<br/>I ask: "What do your characters want?"<br/><br/>Do you describe how you are trying to win the stakes? If yes, at what point in the resolution process do you describe how?<br/>No no no, never. The high card describes how. ALWAYS, or there won't be much for the high card to narrate.<br/><br/>Do you have any house rules for PTA? If yes, what are they?<br/>Lets see, our current season? And these may just be the way I produce:<br/>-Pitch session only lasts a half hour.<br/>-During pitch, if you say you don't like something that another player has come up with, you have to offer an alternative.<br/>-We don't play if all the original players can't make it to the session.<br/>-If a player forgets to give fan mail during a scene, we allow them to do it retroactively<br/>-If a player has an idea for a scene, I let them frame it even if it's not their turn. We then skip them when it is their turn.<br/>-We strictly adhere to including all the "Next On's" as a kind of goal for each episode. It kind of works as an interesting pacing mechanic to use in parallel to budget.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170072/#Comment_170072" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T08:10:11+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  8:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Are most of your scenes conflict driven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>If a scene doesn't have conflict, what do you do?

Does the person with the highest card get to speak for the other characters? What do they do?</blockquote>\nSometimes the high card person narrates the scene to the end, sometimes they just give directions in the scene with strong veto power while others role-play it out based on their specs.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Does the Producer take the lead driving the plot?</blockquote>\nIt helps a whole lot if the producer is a strong scene framer and someone who has good ability to weave it all together but the word plot gives me the shits.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>How do you define your stakes? If I win, this happens? The stakes are over X? Something else?</blockquote>\nI used to over-define my stakes and found it neutered the narrative control of the high card.  Now we are much more loose on the initial intent and allow the narration to decide how it comes to be.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Do you describe how you are trying to win the stakes? If yes, at what point in the resolution process do you describe how?</blockquote>\nNo, as I said, loose nowadays.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Do you have any house rules for PTA? If yes, what are they?</blockquote>\nI don't really use the different types of scenes, character or plot.  I just don't find it useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170118/#Comment_170118" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T10:40:34+00:00" title="September 19, 2008 10:40AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Are most of your scenes conflict driven?<br/>If a scene doesn't have conflict, what do you do? Push for one? Skip it? Something else?</blockquote>\nIt varies. Sometimes scenes make sense without a conflict in them. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes we're happy to just deal only with set-up or pay-off for other scenes. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>Before you play a scene, do you define the scene's Focus, Agenda, and Location?<br/>If not, how do you define a scene before play?</blockquote>\nAt first I was very strict about defining Focus, Agenda and Location. I wanted to make sure that everybody at the table was clear about what was happening in the game. But I noticed that many of the people I played with had their own lingo to get some of the things across. And now we rarely actually name the Location of the scene. I still make sure that everybody pays attention to a scene's Agenda when the game starts, but once the players have included it in their pre-scene exchange.. I rarely have to mention it. It's the same with Focus, really. The less familiar the players are with TV conventions or articulating character-driven stories, the more often we make sure to include it. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Does the Producer have stakes?<br/>Can Protagonists have conflicts against each other?<br/>If yes, can they have Stakes that contradict each other?<br/>If yes, do the Protagonists compare their cards against each other or against the Producer?<br/>If against the Producer, what happens if both Protagonists beat the Producer?</blockquote>\nThis also varies a lot. In some conflicts it makes sense for the characters to compare cards against the Producer. Most internal conflicts I'd say. In some cases it makes more sense for the players to compare cards with one another - explicitly antagonistic conflicts, like physical fights. It really has a lot to do with how the players look at the characters and the fiction. In some scenes conflicts are merely character issue projected onto the outside world, in others it's an outside conflict coloured by a character's issue. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>How do you handle narration? Does the person with the highest card get to speak for the other characters? What do they do?</blockquote>\nAgain, it varies. Most of the times Highest Card = Veto Card. Character consistency is very important to me, more so than "my guy"-ism. Sometimes the highest card does overrule everybody else's opinion at the table, but then it's usually a question of "trust me guys, this is going to work". Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. But we usually just want the game to carry on and not get bogged down by hairsplitting arguments that would make Trek fans blush. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>Does the Producer take the lead driving the plot?</blockquote>\nThat depends on the show. If it's a character-driven drama, the Producer is mostly just making sure that the episode doesn't meander or leave to many questions unanswered. In a more plot-driven or franchise-heavy show, the Producer usually makes sure that the episode doesn't stray off the formula too much. Although single character spotlight episodes can sometimes choose to go a little off the rails. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>How do you define your stakes? If I win, this happens? The stakes are over X? Something else?</blockquote>\nAgain, it varies and depends mostly on what the players need to visualise the conflict. Sometimes it's as simple as saying "your issue independence is at stake". Sometimes it's about clarifying what the character wants to achieve. And sometimes sketching out some rough ideas of what a win and a loss means is needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
