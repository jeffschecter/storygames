Looking forward to hearing your ideas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>First question. Do you know anyone (online) that's updated any older D&amp;D modules? Preferably the classics (Tomb of Horrors, Giant series, etc...) but any older modules will help.<br/><br/>Second question. What VERY IMPORTANT points would you consider when planning to update older module-adventures? To make them better to fit the new rules/game-play of D&amp;D4.<br/><br/><br/>I don't need help updating monsters, that's the EASIEST part with D&amp;D4.<br/>I'm looking for ideas on the strategy, layout of encounters, times for encounters, how to use/place treasure 'parcels' for old-style modules, etc.... Things for updating and DMing an old-school classic adventure-module so that it retains the fun memories of the classics but fits the RULE and STRUCTURE of the newer D&amp;D4 system.<br/><br/><br/>Any links or specific suggestions would help!<br/>thanks<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237951/#Comment_237951" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-17T09:28:06+00:00" title="October 17, 2009  9:28AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2009 9:28AM by Ry.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Answering second question only:<br/><br/>Very first thing - 4e's encounter concept is drastically different from the one in those classic modules.<br/><br/>Look at the advice for building encounters and then look how you can combine multiple rooms into those encounters.<br/><br/>For example, a bare minimum encounter size is about 10x10, if I remember correctly, and 10x20 feels better.<br/><br/>Try to find ways that those other encounter elements (magical fountains, trap doors, etc.) can be tweaked to be part of and relevant for an encounter.  For example, if there's a poison needle in a treasure chest, it's not really part of the encounter.  But if there's a poison needle triggered by standing next to the treasure chest, and the chest is something the goblins yell "retreat with the treasure!" then it's a whole other deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

It's pretty cool and does give some good insight on ways to mod for 4e. Among other things, it's much smaller. Essentially the whole second level is gone. The throne room encounter is made much more tactical. And there's a gather-intel skill challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
