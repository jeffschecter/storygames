They recommend doing this by making sure there's a clear distinction between the mundane and the weird in the book, but I'm not sure how to do that. One idea I had was making sure there's always some minor "real life" plots going on in tandem with the main weirdo cult murder magic plot. My thought is to do subplots that highlight some of the NPCs of the game.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>We've established a character named Hudson who's a total stereotype. Overweight geeky guy who does nothing but play World of Warcraft. I'm thinking that while this weirdo stuff is going on, he's going to try to make romantic overtures towards the female PC.<br/><br/>And maybe the PC's boyfriend, who's a chef at a restaurant, is worried that they're losing business and is stressed out and there's drama with that.<br/><br/>I'm thinking two at a time might be good.<br/><br/>Any other ideas or suggestions or feedback on this idea?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin" title="ElectricPaladin"><img alt="ElectricPaladin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayStressed.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin">ElectricPaladin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185486/#Comment_185486" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T11:07:36+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 11:07AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of what I do is keep things ambiguous and unsteady. Inconsistency is your friend. The Occult Underground is not something you use - it uses you (in Soviet Russia...)<br/><br/>For me, a lot of it is in the descriptions. Spice up your narrative with little bits of weirdness, things that you're relatively sure your player will notice, but not seize on, and sure as hell aren't going to explain. Is there an old man with a strange birthmark walking down the street, hand in hand with a little boy who looks nothing like him, except for the exact same birthmark? Do homeless men bow to the main character as she passes one day, and then ignore her the next? Is there a teenager with ragged toy fairy wings strapped to her back begging on a street corner, staring into the eyes of every passer-by, until she finds what she's looking for and walks away... and a well-dresses businesswoman type follows her? Do her growing connections in this weird world always want to meet her in strange places - under bridges, in bars full of strangely dressed people sipping unidentifiable drinks, in unscheduled street fairs that look like refugees from Burning Man and vanish without a trace the next day? Well, why the hell not?! That's what Unknown Armies <i>is</i>!<br/><br/>The deeper the character goes into this world, the weirder things should get, and when she withdraws back to her ordinary life (and the ordinary plots you so outlined), things should get a little more normal... but things should never go back to the way they were. She's opened the door, and that's the price you pay for admission. You might win anything, but you always lose everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185489/#Comment_185489" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T11:14:28+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 11:14AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well that's the thing.

There should be traces of normal in the weird (because weird things stand out so much more if they are in the context of or represent inverted versions of normalcy) and - now that she's entered the Underground and there's no way back - traces of weird in her normal.<br/><br/>I <i>think</i> that better articulates my point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185492/#Comment_185492" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T11:23:06+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 11:23AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see.

Sit differently. Talk differently. Look at her differently. Maybe you could have a candle you light when you're in "normal" and blow out in "weird" mode, to change the lighting and also produce that little thrill of terror when you abruptly blow out the candle. You should also definitely look into music. It might help to create a "normal world" soundtrack (mellow, real music, with the occasional odd bent) and an "Occult Underground" soundtrack.<br/><br/>This, by the way, from the "take my advice, I'm not using it" department. I talk big, but I have yet to get my act together and actually <i>do</i> all this stuff. But if you tell me it works, maybe I finally will :-P.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185507/#Comment_185507" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T12:20:23+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 12:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think along those lines it's also good to make a bunch of things which actually are NOT weird, but seem weird because the character is looking for them.

Some of them are nice, some of them suck, some of them want to use you, some of them want to be used by you. Most of the time they're kinda dumb, like people are, and often kinda cunning, like people are. And then something goes really wrong, and someone wants something that someone else really doesn't want them to have, and one of them is willing to hurt or kill a whole lot of people to get/not get the thing. <br/><br/>And that's 95% of the game. And just when you're getting to the point of dealing with all these twitchy people who are willing to shoot you, one of them pulls off his face and frogs rain from the sky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185611/#Comment_185611" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T13:57:37+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  1:57PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>some of them want to use you, some of them want to be used by you</blockquote>\nI assume that some of them want to abuse you and some of them want to be abused as well, right? (Wink)<br/><br/>My take on this advise in teh book is not to have everything be a supernatural thing.  If you over-amp the OU aspect and never see the "real world" aspect of it, it becomes less and less like a modern fantasy and more a pure fantasy with guns and cellphones.  That being said, it is the magical element that brings you to the table.<br/><br/>I have two suggestions regarding this:  Have the restaurant issue seem very mundane for many sessions and drive the relationship issues instead of tapping into the odd, and then have the PC notice after some time steeped in the OU that the restaurant had really bad Feng Shui.  Not terribly odd, but it shows a slight overlap between her old life and the new one.  Now, to drive that nail a bit more, does she share this information with the boyfriend (especially if he is unaware of her new contacts)?<br/><br/>Another possible vector of some mundane come weird is the Wow player may give insights into things without meaning to because it is something similar to what happens in the game.  He isn't a sage, he's just got enough of a toe in the weird that he has insights (or, at least, can empathize with the "one step removed" aspect of the PC life).<br/><br/>The other flow path can be fun too.  Imagine when a big player in the OU comes to the PC to get some hockey tickets (because the PC's cousin works in the team's ticket office).  The OU rumor mill starts trying to find the significance of this and no one is prepared to believe that the hitter just wants to watch some hockey from some nice seats.<br/><br/>Also, just try and imagine an OU bridal shower....(chills)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185654/#Comment_185654" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T21:53:58+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  9:53PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>but you also don't want an hour of grocery lists and deleting your web browser history so your girlfriend doesn't see that you've been surfing porn sites again.</blockquote>\nActually I would suggest that you do want that. Because that sort of activity is transformed by placing it in the context of the Weird Occult -- and the transformation is more powerful when the boundary remains strong, not when there is constant bleed-over. The players (and player characters) will make the choice as to whether they want to make these problems Occult or whether they will embrace them as a respite from their other seemingly-more-complex issues.<br/><br/>In short, I am not sure I am in favour of all the suggestions that promote ambiguity -- things that seem weird but aren't, weird things intruding everywhere but not quite enough to merit investigation, etc. Then again these are thoughts drawn from playing Changeling, not Unknown Armies -- but my understanding is both games have a pretty fundamentally similar structure when it comes to the weird/not-weird. <br/><br/>And I'm not saying the bait and switch is not fun too, I guess -- just that you seemed to be asking about keeping them separate, and most of the answers so far seem to be in opposition to that idea. You don't need to weird-up WoW -- the fact that there is some guy who spends fifteen hours a day playing WoW when he is increasingly aware that the world is full of actual magic is already perfectly compelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185668/#Comment_185668" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T00:59:31+00:00" title="January  2, 2009 12:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, you gotta remember that the 'post-modern' in that game is partly that the weird things that you do just because you are a weird obsessive person become magical purely because of being imbued in meaning by your interest.
