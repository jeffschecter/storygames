I'd give a quick example of a turn, maybe even have us play a short scene, then describe how the Tilt works, and then the Aftermath. I'm planning to have 3 playsets available to choose from so as to avoid choice paralysis but still offer the potential players some leeway.<br/><br/>Given the time constraint on the actual play (~3 hours), I want to get through the initial setup quickly, but still low a bit of choice. I don't love the idea of just handing out quickstart cards, but I also don't want to spend an hour passing the playset around the table 4 times.  Have any of you found a happy medium on this? <br/><br/>Jason, I'd love to hear from you on any of this, of course.<br/><br/>TIA,<br/><br/>-Jim C.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318259/#Comment_318259" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T22:24:15+00:00" title="March 30, 2011 10:24PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Longest game I ever played was 2:15 (which was our first one), and we only ever have one copy so I've never had a problem with time with Fiasco.<br/><br/>One thing we did wrong the first time which sped it up was have people choose two things from the playset on their turn so we only went around the table twice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318264/#Comment_318264" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-31T02:33:41+00:00" title="March 31, 2011  2:33AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We ran three hour slots at Conpulsion last weekend - more than enough time for a full game with four players including break before the Tilt and Aftermath.

The things players need to know:<br/><br/>1. Build relationships first, characters later<br/>2. Include at least one object, need and location<br/>3. 4 scenes per player total, so go after what you want<br/>4. Establish or resolve, and ideally resolve without interrupting the scene<br/>5. Give your die away in act one and keep it in act two<br/>6. Seek die color uniformity if you want a happy ending for your dude<br/><br/>That's it. You can explain the Tilt and Aftermath in play.<br/><br/>In terms of facilitating, I always pick three playsets I'd like to try and offer those as the only choices for the session. Then we do relationships first, followed by objects, needs and locations after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318307/#Comment_318307" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-31T11:14:13+00:00" title="March 31, 2011 11:14AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco should fit in a three hour time slot easily enough, provided that you don't dawdle on scenes too long.  If you're worried about the time being too short (like, you're a verbose speaker and your scenes go long), then you could use the Insta-Setups that are in most Fiasco playsets.  Don't define beyond the list of elements provided, though: Give the players a list of three to five relationships, one or two needs, etc. and go around the table picking where those go.  This gives a sense of the full setup process, but won't take as long.  <br/><br/><br/>For a ten minute demo, I'd think that you'd want to already have a sample situation made up, in which you hand the prospective player their relationships and needs, and ask "so, what is your guy like, given these facts about him?"  Make the relationships and stuff intersect so that the player can surprise you with awesome, off-the-wall ideas that fit, but also with an easy to figure out option for people who are easily stymied.  Make sure they have at least one need.  Then you have them frame a short scene around their need, and you decide how it resolves.  Walk them through that, and explain briefly the reverse situation where you frame and they resolve.  <br/><br/>You might have more detail (jump ahead to the end and talk about Aftermath) if you have time.  But really, you'd want to get to the core of creativity, freeform roleplaying, easy resolution and tangled relationships that form the core of Fiasco, even if you mangle the rules to get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318311/#Comment_318311" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-31T11:28:01+00:00" title="March 31, 2011 11:28AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have a Fiasco demo that Jason wrote, but the instructions are mostly in his head.
