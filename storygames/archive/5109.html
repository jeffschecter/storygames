Assume that rival Gods own the concepts (because they do) in an Icelandic saga sort of setting.  Ideally I'd like them to be punchy enough that any two can be paired to create custom Gods, but failing that, I want to identify the most juicy possible pairings.  Here's an example:<br/><br/><b>Peace </b>and <b>Freedom</b><br/><br/>This is a great pair because they are in both opposition and concordance.  There's a lot of story meat in there.  Will we submit to draconian rule to ensure our safety?  Will we fight a bloody war to be free?  Some say you can't have both at once.  The relationship between them (and their representative Gods) will always be tumultuous.  Here are some other concepts:<br/><br/><b>Beauty <br/>Clan / Community<br/>Courage<br/>Destiny<br/>Faith<br/>Hearth / Family <br/>Honor <br/>Justice <br/>Knowledge <br/>Love <br/>Truth <br/>Wisdom </b><br/><br/>What are most interesting matches?  What concepts am I missing?  What are unusual, but productive, pairings?  What are dead-end, flat pairings?  Can the list be pared or expanded?  Thanks for your thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115335/#Comment_115335" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T10:20:15+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 10:20AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, do you have a particular style you want?

Here's how I'd slice them. Not sure how Norsely the slicing is, but the logic is pretty straightforward in each case:<br/><br/>Beauty vs. Wisdom. The realm of appearances is shallow; to see beyond appearances is wisdom.<br/>Clan/Community vs. Truth. Social conventions are mere polite fictions; only by leaving them behind do we approach the truth.<br/>Courage vs. Love. It takes courage to overcome what we fear; it takes love to transform fear into something else.<br/>Destiny vs. Hearth/Family. The pull of hearth and home must be resisted in order to pursue one's grander destiny.<br/>Faith vs. Knowledge. One may believe, or one may know.<br/>Honor vs. Justice. Honor is sheer self-regard; justice requires that we regard the rights of others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115359/#Comment_115359" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T11:30:06+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 11:30AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Bill!<br/><br/>Now a challenge - for each of those statements you made, provide one that says the exact opposite.

My only problem is I can come up with really exciting ones for every pairing I look at.<br/><br/>Knowledge vs. Truth: This is a good and subtle one, I think, despite your concerns, it sort of touches on the whole Stephen Colbert truthiness thing. It seems stereotypically Norse-y to me (also Gaelicy) to count the difference between factual knowledge and deeper truth. Why does it seem flat to you?<br/><br/>Clan vs. Hearth: The old Eros/Agape thing. Is it more important to honor the society or your family and loved ones?<br/><br/>Beauty vs. Justice: Is what is appealing right, or is it important to be just even if it destroys joyful, beauteous things?<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I could do this all day I think. That's a good sign. As for what's missing, what about Pride? Sex?

So one player is some PC dude traveling about, but also plays Lady Freedom on a meta-level - and if her piece occupies the place he visits, it's all gravy for him. But if Lord Peace owns the spot, that's trouble, or at least ill-starred.  And whoever is ascendent (or if both are absent early in the game) or if a piece has recently been captured there - well, that informs what's going on in that location, along with other factors.  So the Gods are literally playing a game with the mortal world, and you play that out, and the Big Ideas they are fighting about color everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115414/#Comment_115414" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T14:38:04+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  2:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess you want each concept to be multi-layered, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nHospitality/Honor/Duty<br/>\n<br/>\nvs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBattle/War/Murder/Vengeance<br/>\n<br/>\nCultures living in rugged or dangerous places tend to have pretty strict rules about hospitality - people drop by, they get fed, are safe, have sanctuary, etc. even if they are enemies. This can be combined with honor-debts owed to relatives, vassals and overlords. The ties that bind.<br/>\n<br/>\nWound up in that, but also opposing it, is the God of Fighting. You go to war for your overlord, if you have one, you fight to protect your family, you raid other clans to feed them. And this is the god that berzerkers pray to, for the fury. But he is also god of killing outside of war. Vengeance is his, when you kill to satisfy an honor debt (blood debt). And murder is his as well, when you kill because of rage or greed or pleasure. Which is opposed to honor. Especially if you kill a guest because he is an enemy. God of fighting smiles on you, but God of honor is slighted.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you just use one word (justice, war) the concepts could come out a little flat. If you give them names and personalities, you can pack in a lot more conceptual punch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115432/#Comment_115432" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T16:10:36+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  4:10PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2007 4:13PM by Bill_White.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this is helpful, but one way to tackle generating the opposing positions is to play "exploding the dualism" (my name for a linguistic thing developed by the semiotician Algirdas Greimas who I'm always on about).<br><br>It works like this. You start with a key term--let's pick one from your list: Clan, say. Clan is now the "simple positive term," and we take it to mean kin, family, and (more broadly) community, although this introduces a little slippage or ambiguity, but we can live with that if the people whose discourse we're trying to map can.<br><br>Next, you identify the simple negative term--the "opposite" of Clan (i.e., "not Clan"). If someone is not clan, they are what? What would our people say? Would they call someone from outside their community a Stranger, an Outsider, or what? Say we like Stranger: This establishes the first of two semantic oppositions: Clan/Stranger.<br><br>You use the first opposition to generate the second. The "complex positive term" is equivalent to "both Clan and Stranger"; the "negative complex term" is "neither Clan nor Stranger." And then you seek in the language of the target group concepts corresponding to those ideas: Perhaps "Ally" works for the former, and "Ancient Enemy" for the latter.<br><br>So now starting from a single word you've generated a set of complementary oppositions, with Clan &lt;-&gt; Stranger corresponding to Ally &lt;--&gt; Ancient Enemy. One interesting thing is that one can usually see some sort of patterned variation in connotation when you layer the pairs. So Clan/Ally on the one hand and Stranger/Ancient Enemy on the other seem to mark a distinction between friend and threat, while Clan/Stranger operates at the level of the hearth or campfire and Ally/Ancient Enemy at the level of the battlefield (peace and war, that is to say).<br><br>But those are not the only meanings available at the level of the complex! The Clan &lt;-&gt; Stranger opposition generates other complexities given other contexts, which may happen to be the domains of the other gods (just like Ally/Ancient Enemy can be seen as the complexity emerging from the effect of the God of War on the Goddess of the Hearth).<br><br>So you could do something like this (or train players to do something like this) for the meta-level game, where the interaction of the gods' spheres of influence had the effect of shading the situation at the level of mortals. So if the Goddess of the Hearth intersects with the God of War, the situation involves the tension between what it means to be Clan or Ally (or between Stranger and Ancient Enemy). Whereas if the Goddess of the Hearth (Clan &lt;-&gt; Stranger) interacts with the Goddess of Beauty (Beauty &lt;-&gt; Ugliness), the situation involves the tension between, um, Familiarity and Strangeness.<br/><br/>Have I been clear or opaque?<br/><br/>Bill                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115450/#Comment_115450" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T19:25:29+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  7:25PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, this is me kissing you on the mouth!
