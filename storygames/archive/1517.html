                    Okay, so the most recent upturning of this frustration is <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1494" rel="nofollow">here,</a> wherein Josh BishopRoby brings up the apparent paradox of <cite>Sorcerer</cite>-style Bangs and the Forge term "Force."  <br/><br/>Now, I was utterly on the same page with Josh, because my understanding of "force" predates my reading <cite>Sorcerer</cite> and certainly predates my reading the Forge Glossary.  It probably predates the Forge, but I wouldn't lay money on it.  As a result, my understanding of force is a recognition of the power bias in GM-led games.  Where the Forge definition is much more narrow, and to my eye unintuitive.<br/><br/>Which probably could be said for a lot of current jargon, which phenomenon can only contribute to the isolationist reputation that certain communities have gathered.  The other strong example that races to mind is "reward system," especially alongside a definition of "system" that is more intuitively what a gamer expects - even if it insightfully includes the informal game structure that players bring to the table.  One would then expect that a reward system is an aspect of the overall system, but the actual definition is such that "systemic rewards" is a synecdoche for a "reward system."<br/><br/>Now, I admit I'm a taxonomy freak.  And I continue along with the idea of a critical language for RPGs in the back of my head.  (And really this is a separate issue: the Forge Glossary seems to be diagnostic of play, rather than critical of design - but the two problem domains are obviously related.)  All the same, there does seem to be some <i>ad hoc</i> phraseology going on, and I wish I could see a way to make useful updates.<br/><br/>For instance, for "Force" I'd propose "hijack," since the intended meaning is someone taking illegitimate, significant control over a character, with analogy to a vehicle.<br/><br/>For "reward system," I'm at more of a loss.  Christopher Kubasik is fond of discussing how a play "engages" or fails to engage him, which usage I find evocative.  I'd propose that "reward system" be discouraged in favor of "reward mechanics," unless it can be made clear that we are talking about non-rules text systems that function as a reward.<br/><br/>I also think that I'm not the only one with these kinds of quibbles, and I'd love to hear about other people's frustrations with jargon, unique usages not in common use, or rebuttals to my general thrust here.                </div>

                            Ultimately, what gets adopted is not best, merely most common. Beta was a superior technology to VHS, but VHS won. We all know that "role-playing game" (or sometimes "roleplaying game" - don't get me started on the hyphen!) is a very clunky and inadequately descriptive term, but it's what stuck. It's commonly accepted now, for better or for worse. We're also all probably familiar with the exchange that goes "I play role-playing games!" "Oh, you mean, like D&amp;D?" It's very rarely best-of-class.<br/><br/>The question here is "has Forge-speak become accepted language?" The answer here at SG and (obviously) at the Forge may be "pretty much," but I don't think that's a closed debate. However, we have the theorists taking things apart and labeling things, and we need linguists coming after them and proposing better, more elegant terms for their labels. The problem is, the linguists are going to fight just as much with each other as with the theorists. I just don't know how much it's worth it to instigate those struggles, as the outcomes will likely be organic but inelegant (adoption and usage) rather than artificial but elegant (ratified and propagated).                        </div>

                            First off, I have yet to have somebody respond to "I play roleplaying games!" with "Oh, like D&amp;D?"  I uniformly get blank stares.  But more to the point:<br/><br/>The obvious model for all of this is academia, which is in the business of naming things and describing how they work, whether the things in question are plant cells, literary movements, protons, main sequence stars, or historical epochs.  Academia also coordinates an entire planet of scholars in an ongoing dialogue which uses some -- to be very generous about it -- common terminology.  Now, the thing about the common terminology is that it's not really all that common.  What is and is not considered Europe, for instance, can set historians battling back and forth for decades.  So instead of 'common' it's probably more accurate to say that the terminology in use is <em>familiar</em>.  I'm not a marxist, for instance, but I do understand the dialectical process.<br/><br/>Of course it's even a little more complicated than that because different thinkers in the same field and philosophy often use the same terminology and then start drifting apart.  Socrates and Aristotle and the single term 'cause' is a good example, or Freud and Lacan.  Even though they started on the same page, their usage and definitions of the terms they use are different.  Other thinkers, in order to distinguish these concepts, often resort to appending names in front of terms: socratic cause, aristotlean cause, freudian ego, lacanian ego.  (Or, in order to make academia more fun and challenging, they <em>don't</em> do that, assume one or the other, and let you figure out what they're saying judging by their own academic backgrounds.)  So one avenue of progress I think we can explore is talking about, for instance, "edwardsian force" in order to distinguish it from closely related concepts that we're interested in talking about separately (like magician's force).<br/><br/>One thing that has been lurking around the corners of my mind is that Ron, who started off a lot of this discourse and good on him for doing so, continues to enforce his definition of a given term.  This is both good and bad.  It's good in that maintaining some measure of consistency is necessary to reliable communication.  Ron ensures a sort of linguistic rigor that would lead to problems if he didn't insist that Force is this, not that and so on.  On the other hand, such consistent correction might also be hampering development of thought.  If it is impossible to discuss gameplay and game design without being corrected into proper Big Model terminology use, that sort of self-correcting process will "correct" all progressive development.<br/><br/>Of course there are times in which this didn't happen.  Vincent's lumpley principle proposed a new and cleaner definition of System than GNS offered at the time, and with Ron's stamp of approval, it got added to the corpus and went into general circulation.  But in every case that I can think of, Ron has served as the gatekeeper to what is and is not an acceptable addition to the lexicon, and I'm pretty sure this is a job that he's not really interested in keeping for the rest of time.  The other problem here is that modes of play and design that are profoundly counter to Ron's understanding of roleplaying have a much harder (or perhaps impossible) time getting stamped with approval.  I think this is a big part of why Simulationism is not very well developed in the body of thought; it's not how Ron likes to play.  He knows that it's there, he can observe it, but in a very real way, he doesn't like it, it doesn't engage him, and consequently he doesn't <em>get</em> it like he gets Narrativism or how somebody who does like Simmy play gets it.<br/><br/>One way around this is to just not use words that Ron's already "claimed."  This is a suboptimal solution for reasons that Judson's suggested, but I think we'd be missing something if we didn't at least acknowledge it.<br/><br/>Now, I'm far from suggesting that Ron lay off and quit participating in these discussions.  I think he provides an important aspect that keeps a lot of discussions from dissolving into nothing.  I do think, however, that Ron as the sole gatekeeper is a bad idea for the body of game design theory as a whole.  And the solution to that is, of course, for other thinkers, theorists, and designers to find their own ways and their own paths, to continue to participate in dialogue with Ron, but also know when and how to politely tell him to fuck off, they're dealing with something from a different angle than his thinking.<br/><br/>However, I think this is already happening.  We have folks like Clinton, Vincent, and Ralph, who may agree with Ron in large part but have their own divergences, different emphases, and different base play preferences.  Hell, <em>I</em> have differences with Ron (as has been recently demonstrated).  There is also a giant body of design philosophy outside of the Forge and "Indie" schools that doesn't give a rip about Ron and his stamp of approval.  I'm actually looking forward to the point where those schools of thought and design start engaging with indie schools; I think we'll see fantastic dialogue there.<br/><br/>And so I've babbled for way too long.  Point being: I think the solution is to keep playing games, designing games, and talking about games.  These wrinkles will iron out eventually; they will iron out faster if we're a little more conscious of the basic interpersonal relationships that they are derived from.  So keep playing and keep talking.  Go Play. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>
