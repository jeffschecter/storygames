That is, people who also like to play and make games, and are eager to talk about their ideas, test each others' games and help each other get started - actually working on the games.<br/><br/>The prime example here at SG would be something like this: The designer of DitV is married to the designer of 1001 Nights. They're friends with the designers of Polaris, Shock:, Steal Away Jordan and others. The DitV designer is also friends with the designer of Sorcerer, who plays with the designer of Allyria, etc etc etc. (There's many more in there, and of course I don't have the whole picture, but you get my drift).<br/><br/>In Norway, game design was, for many years, something done by people working alone, like hermits on mountaintops. We started talking to each other via fanzines, and later over the Internet; but what has really made things kick these last few years is that we've become friends, and meet each other in real life, and play each others' games. So now, the designer of Itras By plays with the designers of Draug and Until we Sink, lives with the guy behind the R.I.S.K. design competition and the designer of 17th of May, etc etc etc.<br/><br/>Even back in 1987 when I was designing my fantasy heartbreaker BeastWorld, I was totally dependent on having someone to play with. The game went through two xeroxed editions, and had three supplements - if I hadn't had my friends, it would only have been a first draft, never copied or played.<br/><br/>So. Here are some things - some broad generalizations - I want to get at:<br/><br/>1. I believe you need to physically meet people to design games. It's the best, and possibly only, way to develop ideas. At a recent meeting in Grimstad, a five-minute talk with one GM helped me change the entire magic &amp; trick system for my most recent project. I'd been writing on it for weeks.<br/><br/>2. While talking to people on forums is a great way to get ideas and inspiration, it's probably not the best way to develop those ideas. There's a certain barrier of impersonality, a lack of "vibe" getting across, that can still leave you in a vacuum.<br/><br/>3. That might be one explanation for the rise of different design cultures. While I've played heaps of indie games, the main influences on my design &amp; actual play styles are still my play groups, my friends, Norwegian designers. We share a vibe when we meet in a room. That vibe is transformed into the soul of our games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108643/#Comment_108643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T03:51:17+00:00" title="November 17, 2007  3:51AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alternately, the charity of friendship interferes with the critical process to create moments of hard-to-remove dogmatic groupthink. This doesn't always happen, but I've seen many friendly relationships that erode disciplined criticism and a constructive workflow when it comes to multiple creative types hacking out work with each other's help. This is why people in creative fields create formal events like workshops instead of just hanging out and Jamming, Dude. A context for unrestrained critique is important.<br/><br/>This isn't the same as having a play group to work with, though. I think face to face play with friends is absolutely necessary to keep from having a warped understanding of how games work. There are too many people projecting their *lack* of this experience broadly and using it as locus for theory. Plus, if you have friends to play with you intuitively aspire to play your designs in the spirit of sharing instead of, say, backhanded protest and punishment. I don't find it especially necessary to game with designers as some kind of feelgood sharing experience, because the people I want to share with are the kinds of people I see every day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108654/#Comment_108654" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T07:13:51+00:00" title="November 17, 2007  7:13AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a half-answer to Malcolm, and a follow-up to my own post:<br/><br/>4. I believe such a creative network produces games that are easy for people from that network to understand and play, given their particular shared styles, techniques and assumptions. However, each network will, in this way, have a few shared blind spots - assumptions about play that they don't share with people outside the network. This sometimes produces game texts that aren't immediately playable for people outside the network.<br/><br/>(I'm also slowly coming to believe that a lot of the criticism we give and receive is of no help to us. However, that belief is only half-formed - I can't really explain what it's based on yet).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108656/#Comment_108656" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T07:32:30+00:00" title="November 17, 2007  7:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So maybe, then, the second most important thing for a group of designers to have is access to lots of people who hate their guts and will scream that they're doing everything wrong at every possible decision point.<br/><br/>And that is why God gave us the Internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108657/#Comment_108657" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T07:34:16+00:00" title="November 17, 2007  7:34AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2007 7:48AM by Malcolm Sheppard.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fair observation, Matthijs.<br/><br/>One thing I've tried to be diligent about over the years is taking time to observe other gaming groups in action as an outsider. It's been invaluable to me when it comes to understanding common habits, styles and situations. It's also something that's given me a very positive attitude about gaming groups, because for all the problematizing and assumptions of dysfunction in the hobby, lots of them Get It. Of course, there's been some situations the other way, too, such as witnessing a Hero Wars game that was so slow and uninteresting that I was able to chat with one player for about 20 minutes without actually affecting play, (Not a comment on HW/Quest, BTW). Then you have situations like the time I studied a couple of dozen D&amp;D games and realized that most of them features error-riddled approaches to the rules, but that it didn't really seem to make too much of a difference to the participants. All of these situations have taught me a lot.<br/><br/>I think that when it comes to making a game accessible, external editing development is a powerful tool because it's very much about considering a broad group of readers and giving them the best look at a game's central ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108658/#Comment_108658" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T07:38:30+00:00" title="November 17, 2007  7:38AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And that is why God gave us the Internet.</blockquote>\nIndeed <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108662/#Comment_108662" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T08:22:07+00:00" title="November 17, 2007  8:22AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eh.

By working together we're really doing much more than either of us could by ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically that's the case largely because we seem to be very bad at explaining potential mechanics to each other (visual thinking vs. thinking based on verbal analogies). That means that we keep on misinterpreting each other and often the misinterpretations are better than the origianal idea or we don't understand the point of the mechanics that the other person prosposes which makes us have to clarify or simplify them, which has really helped us work out a lot of kinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut daaaaaaaaaaaaamn does theory blather over IM take a lot of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
