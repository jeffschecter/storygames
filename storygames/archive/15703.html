For example, when you cloister yourself in preparation for your destiny, forswear any wealth or title.  You may now choose from the moves in this playbook the next time you level.<br/><br/>As for monk moves, I'd consider a pilgrimage move that lets you roll to not consume rations during a trek.  A meditation move that similarly allows you a chance to forgo consuming rations when you make camp.  <br/><br/>As for combat, I'd consider d6.  However, I'd give them an better alternatives to defend.  For example, <br/>Move Like Water<br/>When you defend, you may spend your hold, 1 for 1, to:<br/>-Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself and subtract your level from their damage<br/>-Halve the attack\u2019s effect or damage and part them from their weapon<br/>-Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +2 forward against the attacker<br/>-Deal damage to the attacker equal to d6 plus your level<br/><br/>Stand by your Words<br/>When you Parley, automatically Defend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356027/#Comment_356027" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T07:50:38+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  7:50AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2012 7:53AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I could see monk as a subclass book like Finer Things that you could elect to take after, say, a big bloody massacre or witnessing some deep injustice.

I'd start just like you are, Orly, and think about "what does a monk do in D&amp;D?  What are they for?"  I think that they're a sort of melee debuff class.  Lots of messing with their opponent instead of straight attacking them or defending a team-mate.  Disarms, group attacks, trips - lots of fun fictional stuff.  <br/><br/>If we look at an AD&amp;D Monk we see that he's armoured like a wizard (not at all) fights like a bit of a hybrid between the thief and the fighter (which is to say, small weapons, low damage) has kind of a  weird hit-point allotment (2d4 at first level).  Also, a handful of thief skills.<br/><br/>I'd probably be disappointed by this, but us it as a springboard to look at the fictional "Monk" and what makes him cool.  Definitely, to me, the breaking of inanimate objects, the throwing of any object as a weapon, acrobatics, cool "trance" stuff like the ability to shrug off poison.  Maybe I'd give him some optional move to mess with the Last Breath - like he's already made his deal; detail it.  The next time you have to roll + Last Breath, don't roll, you just act as if you'd gotten a 10+ and fight on.  Something like that to reflect his inner peace with Death and so doesn't have it hanging over him the way other people do.<br/><br/>Just spitballing random ideas, though.  I love Monks - they're probably my favourite class to play after Paladins and Clerics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356038/#Comment_356038" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T08:44:54+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  8:44AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that monks always seem to do is rely on a combination of local hospitality and resources from their order.  <br/><br/>Give and You Shall Receive<br/>When give away all your gold, hold 1.

Don't know where his ideas were headed.<br/><br/>I can see several ways of doing this. I LOVE the mini class where you observed great slaughter or injustice, that's amazing. The idea of it being a whole class is appealing, but a lot of the obvious abilities feel like they're covered by the Fighter and Thief, so I'm not sure about how to carve out the space for the class. Maybe the Monk is all about turning your own power against you: When an enemy attacks you, gain 1 hold.

Most men, when they have no sword or shield, you can stop imagining them murdering you and enjoy a drink together. But there is nothing you can take away from a monk to make him anything but an existential threat. To be able to deal with people in a feudal society with no state monopoly on force, he needs to cultivate an aura of peace that overcomes the fact that he is always prepared to kill anyone he can reach. I'd want to see mechanics that stress how important it is to cultivate and demonstrate a peaceful heart, or perhaps instead mechanics that tend to force monks into hermitage. <br/><br/>I love Gabor's (way's) idea that a monk might gain hold by not having killed for a day, a week, a month, a year, ever. It reminds me of the ascetics of Indian legends, practicing their rigorous disciplines for ages, gaining godlike power that they will lose the moment they unleash it. <br/><br/>As the Monk walks through town, a pure and innocent smile on his face, birds fly behind him, and children come to him for a blessing and leave delighted. Everyone knows that his is the path of peace - the proof is practically overflowing from him. But equally, everyone knows that if he were to witness a terrible injustice, his wrath would in turn be more terrible than magefire, and the sun would shine less brightly on him on his next morning walk, the birds would not follow, and the children would make way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356077/#Comment_356077" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T13:05:24+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  1:05PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>So, I was wondering what kind of things Monks do in a Dungeons &amp; Dragons kinda game?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Not to rain on the parade here, but, their job is to be exoticized Asian people.</p>\n<p>If you want violent religious weirdos you only need to look as far as the Crusades, and if you want violent people without obvious weapons you only have to look as far as the local pub.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356080/#Comment_356080" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T13:17:04+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  1:17PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>If you want violent religious weirdos you only need to look as far as the Crusades</blockquote>\nOr the Paladin playbook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356083/#Comment_356083" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T13:25:32+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  1:25PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Not to rain on the parade here, but, their job is to be exoticized Asian people.</blockquote>\nYeah.<br/><br/>A thought: If you want to have monks in your game, you should base them off of monks.

Which is the fictional space we're trying to recreate, here.  So, from a narrative / thematic / feel perspective, Monk means "D&amp;D class Monk" <br/><br/>That said, we're not replicating mechanics, so having some Monks do all kinds of other monk-ish stuff besides punching your face in is totally a cool direction to go.  They're generally pretty wise, they understand riddles and philosophy, can engage in dialogue, write scrolls, understand the world in a spiritually-internalized way (I quite like this about Monks, they're spiritually-focused without being Deistic in the way a Cleric is) and do some neat things the other characters can't.<br/><br/>They're a gaming archetype that, sure, may have originated as an homage to 70s kung-fu movies or whatever, still stands as relevant.  I'd LOVE to see something that mechanically enforces that they come from "somewhere else".  Since Monks are all humans, in my mind, maybe that's their race move.  "Mountain Monastery" or "Seaside School" or something like that.

It's like, everybody else is from Hommlet, but the one guy wants his character to have traveled thousands of miles to get there (but he's still 1st level). Or else, you have to find some way of integrating this archetype of the martial artist/renunciate into your Western-flavored setting, which they tried to do in 3E Forgotten Realms, for example, if I recall correctly. My feeling is:<i> it just doesn't fit</i>, and they probably should never have included the class in the 1E Player's Handbook in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe there could be an "Oriental Adventures" supplement for DW at some point? OTOH, I doubt I would use it.

Now, there are also Sufis and Yogis and Anchorites and Gurus and shit too. <br/><br/>And the where kung-fu monk stuff comes from the Shoalin Buddhism Monastery, where they practice Chan (Zen) Buddhism, the most punk-rock of the Buddhisms. Obviously this is a popular trope in action movies.<br/><br/>Now, the Monk as a combat class uses their fist and simple weapons (staves) because they are poor. They can't afford swords. See Friar Tuck and vows of poverty and whatever. <br/><br/>As far as Martial Arts are concerned, like there are martial arts from pretty much everywhere. It's just advanced training with your fists and what simple weapons on has available. I've done "European" martial arts training that was pretty much "how not to get stabbed if a dude has a knife and you don't." I'm not European so I don't know if that counts as cultural appropriation. <br/><br/>I hope, Shreyas, that you'll have the charity to read my intentions as other than attempting some kind of Orientalism. I was asking about playing acetic martial artists, ecstatic dervishes, overweight brewers, wise patriarchs, tantric cultists, whatever. "OMFG ASIAN DUDES WITH SLIT EYES AND CHOPSOCKY AND THE PANDAS FUCK YEAH" was not my intention.<br/><br/>I have six years of anti-oppression training, theory and praxis behind me and few black eyes, a few fractures and a broken clavical for being a queer anarchist (some of which are from the police.) I don't really want this thread to turn to some kind of witch hunt about identity politics and cultural appropriation because mostly in this context that shit is unwarranted and unproductive. I think your statement about 'racefail' is outrageous and would like to see it unpacked.<br/><br/>However, you're point about the originary Monk-class being about exoticism and orientalism is well taken. I agree that reproducing that would be problematic. As I said, that's not really my goal. I take most of my fantasy cues from Delany and LeGuin, and not say, Tolkeen; I'm not really interested in having the party go on an 'Oriental Adventure.' <br/><br/>I am interested in have a class that exists because, yes, it's in D&amp;D, but also, East-West-North-South, there are those walk paths to enlightenment in a monastic context. I'd like to have characters like that in my light fantasy game.<br/><br/>Anyways, I've written the playbook and am more or less happy with it. <br/>Thanks for the feed back everyone.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356150/#Comment_356150" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T19:16:46+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  7:16PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of monks being a broader application that the 'orientalism', kung-fu kickarse model being bandied about. I think Orly's intention above clarifies this into an imminently playable playbook suitable to the broader DW 'verse. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of countering 'racefail' objections to D&amp;D tropes, I like to encourage - as DM - as many non-sterotypical 'visions' (for want of a better term) of folk's fantasy ideas. Having inspirational imagery that includes female, dark skinned paladins for instance, or purports transgender fighters. Whatever. DW by design is narratively open. The moves interact with the fiction intimately as expressions of the players authorship. The canon of the game is up to your group, using whatever cues you find appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrly's vision above strikes a rather cool chord with me. I'm sure Sage and Adam will include a particularly awesome iteration either as a core playbook or a 'compendium' style upgrade. I like the correlation with the touchstone too.  And a lost elvish monk looking for redemption after being ousted from her reclusive, pacifist order?

So can you.</p>\n<p>Second, let me remind you of the second post in this thread, where you said, "I think in D&amp;D they are basically an excuse to have oriental style martial artists." I cannot even begin to describe the problems that inhere in this sentence but for some foolish reason I have attempted this Sisyphean task, to be met with derision when I pointed out the precise things you were saying.</p>\n<p>Third, if you had bothered to think about the Atlantis post, you would have noticed that I used Atlantis (the choice of place does not matter at all) as a way to introduce a less-problematic treatment of regional culture: presenting broadly applicable material for several character classes. So what you get is that, in the world <em>that</em> text describes, is that you know there's a place that has all kinds of people who do lots of different things, and by the way the classes are changed, you learn that they do things a little differently over there.</p>\n<p>By presenting a singular class as the 'guy from a faraway land' class, you create a text that says 'all guys from a faraway land are <em>like this.'</em> Sage* pointed out the Quarantine, and I agree, that is an effective and respectful way to handle this, but the Monk isn't. The text of the Monk is "all folks from the faraway land that Monks are from are Monks; we know this because the text of all the other playbooks says they're from around here."</p>\n<p>I realize that racial sensitivity issues require some sophisticated reasoning, so maybe you should stop and reread the thread and make sure you have assimilated it all before you continue to post.</p>\n<p>*: Edited for fact correction: Adam was actually the person who pointed out the Quarantine.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356245/#Comment_356245" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T07:59:18+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  7:59AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing about martial artists: they embrace nature, specifically human nature (to differentiate it from druids) as something dynamic. The philosophy by which they do this may change from one fighting style to another, but all of them come from observation of the natural world. So martial artists aren't tuned with animals or plants around them as the druids, they are tuned with their own nature and place in the world, whatever it is.<br/><br/>So some monks can perhaps see the world as a violent place and let the destruction flow from their fists into the world, watching it change, evolve and reborn from the ashes they left behind.<br/>Others can believe that strength is meant to be used to protect the weak, and yet that strenght doesn't need to be purely physical, but it might also include determination or pure persistence.<br/><br/>If you want to make a mechanical difference, still keep some of the western intact, but add kung-fu flavor into it, why don't try this?<br/><br/>-Make martial artist a subset of moves that can be added to any class. So a fighter+martial artist is a samurai, cleric+martial artist is a monk, etc. It was no different in medieval China, you could have fighters, monks, druids, wizards, and they could consider the way they fight and art... or merely a way of living.<br/>-Throw all kind of weird moves, even perfected versions of previos moves from that character. A fighter using twin blades can observe a mantis and optimize a grappling move using her blades, for example. That alone makes her a "martial artist"<br/>-Travel and adventuring is not only a good way of training, but the best way to see and learn from the world itself, and apply the things the martial artist learned, especially their way of thinking. Testing things is the only way to find if they are true or not.<br/><br/>BTW, I think that rpg rules and settings are about making interesting content and inspire people to play a game. Being respectful and tolerant to other people's beliefs goes both ways even when you think other's peoples beliefs are crap, so that's more than a reason to try and make rulebooks less archetypical and not vent frustration on people that simply won't change their beliefs, specially when you present your opinions by flaming them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356246/#Comment_356246" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T08:03:57+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  8:03AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just realized that when I think "D&amp;D" and "monk" that the first image that pops into my head is Ember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356251/#Comment_356251" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T08:50:50+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  8:50AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second the motion to declare that Monks are from Atlantis, chiefly on the grounds that people would be harder-pressed to slip into painful stereotype if their martial arts master was from an imaginary, non-ethnicized place rather than a vaguely Asiatic one.<br/>the first time i encountered the d&amp;d monk it was in the 3e core books.<br/>the second time i encountered the d&amp;d monk, it was in the 3e book <i>Oriental Adventures</i>. <br/>so yes, it's about people using easy stereotypes. Wizards goes pretty light on overt Asian stereotypes, but anything i can do to cock-block racist trolls from engaging in that kind of bullshit, i will.<br/><br/>for a bit of a lost-tribe, Atlantean flair, i would recommend the Prince of Nothing series and the unfortunately-named character Cleric: his ageless race began committing suicide centuries ago, and he hasn't seen another member of his culture in decades at least. he's crazy, he's a mercenary and a bounty hunter, and he knows all about the Hidden Mountain Fortress that the protagonist is trying to locate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356252/#Comment_356252" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T08:55:38+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  8:55AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... Orientalism is everywhere in gaming. Some of it happens to be in really good games.  I mean, Shreyas wrote Mist-Robed Gate, so he knows that.  It's a great game and also, in practice at the table, ends up bringing out a lot of stereotypes about East Asia, because people just say all this stuff that they've absorbed from wherever.  When I ran Mist-Robed Gate two GoPlays ago, I set it in Atlantis for exactly that reason, so I wouldn't be horribly offended at what my friends came up with.  There are bunches of really great indie games that can encounter similar issues: The Mountain Witch, 1001 Nights, How We Came to Live Here, etc.<br/><br/>But there are definitely ways to mitigate this on the design side, either by giving people the tools to say things about another culture that aren't just drawn from their own stereotypes and limited experience or reframing things so that you're not making explicit statements about real-world cultures when you play.  Both are totally acceptable solutions, I think, but the latter is a lot easier (since it doesn't require you to know and empower other players with real cultural knowledge) and that's the one John is sketching out there.  It's a smart move!  A lot of traditional D&amp;D stuff is really problematic, and it's not just the chainmail bikinis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356262/#Comment_356262" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T09:35:10+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  9:35AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would be really interested in seeing a thread on the larger topic of stereotyping (race, gender) and orientalism in RPGs and media in general. <br/>I am not opening the thread myself because I clearly don't understand the issues and politics of privilege well enough to moderate it. <br/><br/>I have many questions, including examples of western stereotyping, good examples of games/productions that avoid being offensive, and how to deal with apparently positive stereotypes (like the monk) that still come out as offensive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356270/#Comment_356270" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T09:56:10+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  9:56AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>You are on a sacred pilgrimage far from your homeland (choose one):<br/><i>- The frozen citadels at the peak of the Frostlight mountains<br/>- The shimmering amber grasslands of the Burning Plains<br/>- The shadowed, ancient halls of the City of Ghosts<br/>- Long forgotten Atlantis, lost in the darkness of time before the age of men or elves</i></blockquote>\nThis is precisely what I was thinking about re: the Monk.  This is cool, full of implied flavour (except replace "Atlantis" because that shit has WAY too much baggage, fictionally) and doesn't break the core concept of what a Monk is.  They're itinerant mystics who fight unarmed (or with weird weapons) and have a philosophy and an interesting "otherness" about them.  I don't give a shit where the Monk comes from, so long as it ain't "here".  The "other place" the Monk comes from is a thing that every GM who has a Monk in their party takes hold of as a golden opportunity to explore what the OTHER people from that place are like.  God knows, even if you're a kick-ass philosopher-warrior, you still have family, friends, enemies and strangers who might follow you to this new land and bring along all sorts of baggage from home.  Hell, maybe there's even a move in the game where that happens.  "When you enter a new place for the first time, someone from your past might've caught up to you..."<br/><br/>The Monk class (in D&amp;D) from a player perspective, besides enabling wire-fu-style shtick, is a way to be Special and Different and some of that is mitigated by DW in that all the classes are unique.  You can't have more than one of them in the party so you're inherently pretty fuckin' special to begin with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356280/#Comment_356280" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T10:29:31+00:00" title="January 27, 2012 10:29AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also in favor of replacing Atlantis on that list.

Therefore they must always be lawful in alignment, although they can be evil, good, or neutral with respect to their approach to lawfulness. A monk who for any reason lases this lawful alignment loses all monk abilities and must begin again as a first level character."</blockquote>\nYou could totally do just about any kind of Monk with this shtick.

Good thing we're basically ignoring it as a reference point for DW.<br/><br/>That's literally the entire non-mechanical description of the monk.

Later-than-the-1st-Ed-PHB Monks are a total mess.  I was just thinking about the conundrum of being loyal to the source material when some of that source material isn't all that sensitive.  Or, rather, what elements to remain loyal to.  I think that we can be "loyal" to the Monk without including into the more embarrassing parts of the classes history.  Looking at the description above (summarily - lawful, rigorously trained aesthetics) There's all kinds of exciting terrain to cover when building this class.  <br/><br/>Thing is, it matters both to me personally and to the game's success (in terms of "does it deliver what it promises to deliver") that it emulate the right elements of D&amp;D.  Calling this class something-not-Monk seems to violate that.  It'd be as if our Core classes were "The Warrior, The Sneak, The Warlock and the Priest" and would sort of colour the game in a way I don't think resonates quite right.  I mean, don't get me wrong, those are cool names for classes, but they're, I don't know, off-brand for Dungeon World.<br/><br/>Obviously, it's a bit of a mine-field, subject-wise.  For most people "Monk" unpacks to "Shaolin Monk" which, for some people, can become "racially insensitive asian martial-arts stereotype".  I think the moves and substance of the class can alter that.  If the very name "the Monk" is offensive, though, inherently - if the problem goes that deep, I'd just as soon not include anything of the sort in the game.  Not officially, anyway.<br/><br/>There's a sort of design hierarchy for me that needs to be followed;  <br/><br/>Is it well-designed and mechanically sound?  If not, it doesn't belong in DW.<br/>Is it offensive?  If so, it doesn't belong in DW. <br/>Is it true to the intentions of the design (emulate the feel and fiction of classic dungeon-crawling adventure?) If not, it doesn't belong in DW.<br/><br/>etc.  <br/><br/>The Monk shouldn't have any problem passing the first and third gate but if it's still coming across as an ignorant, shitty stereotype, the other two don't count.  By the same token, if it's inoffensive and well designed but doesn't fit in to the game (say, The Spaceman or The Gorilla Robot playbooks) it still doesn't belong in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356338/#Comment_356338" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T13:42:40+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  1:42PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side note on the name "Adept" is that was a 3E NPC class.

Had I done that, we could have clarified a lot of what Is and Is Not a "Monk", and what Would and Would Not be cool to include in a DW monk-style class.<br/><br/>So I was about to poke at this a little:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Spooked</cite>So, I was wondering what kind of things Monks do in a Dungeons &amp; Dragons kinda game?</blockquote>\n...with the thought that, "If you don't know, then this project is off to a bad start," with the intention of being like, "You should become familiar with it on your own before taking on such a project". Though rereading it, not sure if Orly(now Spooked) was familiar with the class and open to ideas, or totally unfamiliar with the class.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's get back to reality for a minute:<br/>The 1st edition monk was made in the era of Shaw Brothers kung fu movies. It was the Chop-Sockey kung fu shaolin-esque monk. Abilities like super powerful fist attacks that increase with speed and power as your level increases, to "falling indefinitely if you're near a wall", to poison immunity... This is all shit straight outta Five Deadly Venoms, folks. These aren't whirling dervishes, mead-brewing Swiss Christians, self-torturing Indian yogis, dutiful Talmud-debating jewish scholars, Sri Lankan pacifist Buddhist monasts... They're all kung fu using Shaolin-equse stereotypes. Oriental Adventures, all it did (and it was one of my favorite books at the time, too!) was offer you alternate martial arts paths to use instead of the default monk martial art: The abilities were all the same. <br/>(Ah, OE also did of course add all the problematic "China and Japan and SE Asia are all pretty much the same blobby thing! Go!)<br/><br/>Let's not bullshit ourselves: If you said you wanted to play a Monk in 1982, then described yourself as Friar Tuck, then you'd have an ass-kicking Shaolin kung-fooey kickpuncher named "Friar Tuck". At 20th level you couldn't brew mead, but you could fall off a cliff and not take damage due to your kung fu, and punch demons like Kenshiro from Fist of the North Star. They weren't thinking "Hey, what about early Christian era friars! They're monks, too!" They were thinking: "Did you see 36th Chamber the other day on Sat AM Kung Fu theater on the USA channel? I want to be THAT."<br/><br/>But hey, as per Shreyas' second (and helpful) post where he suggests being more reflective about what you want to get out of the Classic Monk: Yes! And folks have already started talking about that direction.<br/><br/>There might be room for both, even. A kung-fu body wizard from Atlantis or wherever. <br/>And perhaps a second class: An aesthetic monast from a culture or order that does... secret monast powers. Body-defying yogis, or keepers of a mysterious ancient power (which would work with everything from Talmud scholars to Zoroastrian astrologers to Skyrim "Greybeards"), with their own special laws that must be obeyed (or broken for story effect!).<br/><br/>I think there's room for both, without combining them into one!<br/><br/>EDIT: Or alternately, combine them into one! But do so in a way where the mysterious ancient power learned from the monastery does not by necessity have to be Shaolin-style kung fu. Leave it as an open damage attack, so that yogis could attack with aphorisms until you were defeated and become their disciple. Or like the Breath attacks of the Greybeards from Skyrim. And so on.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356378/#Comment_356378" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T16:09:24+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  4:09PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>...It is only seven letters wrong; I'm sure even a monkey or dolphin could put those shapes in the right order.

Or at least no more problematic and awkward than the basic conceit of adventurers who use violence as one means (of several) of solving problems. If there's stuff that you guys feel is problematic or awkward I'd love to hear about it, here or privately. We've tried to steer clear of some of the really horrendous parts of D&amp;D: dark-skinned evil elves, the idea that anything is, as a species, evil. The same applies to more design-oriented stuff, like one-spell Wizards and stand-and-attack fighters. If there's anything in there that's there just because "its D&amp;D!" we're off base. Any stuff that is part of D&amp;D and is in DW is there because it's a part that's helped grabbed the imaginations of so many people of the years.</blockquote>\nFor what it's worth, when I ran it, one of my players was immensely frustrated by the impractical clothing the female characters on the play books were wearing, and spent the first half hour of play with crayons covering up all their exposed skin. the Fighter in particular seemed to make her cranky, and she didn't love the thief, either. Something to consider in future revisions. the chain mail bikini is certainly a trope, but if you're trying to avoid the ones that are simply traditional or even exploitative, thats not a bad place to start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356941/#Comment_356941" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T09:41:24+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  9:41AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite><br/><br/>For what it's worth, when I ran it, one of my players was immensely frustrated by the impractical clothing the female characters on the play books were wearing, and spent the first half hour of play with crayons covering up all their exposed skin. the Fighter in particular seemed to make her cranky, and she didn't love the thief, either.

Her outfit was an active choice by the artist to portray a savage jungle warrior-elf lightly armoured.  Emily did some other versions but that's the one she settled on.  It's the most "provocative" of the pieces but I wouldn't call it any attempt to sexualize the character.  These things being in the eye of the beholder, I need to unpack that I'm not making excuses or saying "you're just seeing it wrong".  It could be interpreted in a handful of ways and I'm happy to acknowledge that.  <br/><br/>(The Thief, though, doesn't make any sense to me.  She's dressed from head-to-toe in leather armour.  Her only exposed skin is on her face and her fingers.  Maybe you can help me understand?)  <br/><br/>The other female characters in the game (the Bard and Wizard) are appropriately clothes for their class, exposing only what skin makes sense for the outfit they're wearing, which were designed to be "pretty but practical".  The chainmail-bikini effect is something we're definitely aware of and, in general, are steering clear of art that's intentionally sexualized or provocative in a derogatory way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356943/#Comment_356943" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T09:43:40+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  9:43AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That said, we've drifted WAY off course in an already-pretty-hostile thread environment.
