Conflict is useful for stories, but it's also a really useful thing in terms of game-play ... it gives you an instant goal (beat the other guy!) and an easy structure (roll your dice/cards/thigh-bone/whatever and get "better" than the other guy for whatever definition of "better").  But there's gotta be other ways, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore getting into great board-games like <i>Puerto Rico</i>, I'm a gonna start out easy:  Solitaire.  A well understood and well known card game with no conflict of any sort.  No other player to have conflict <i>with</i>!  And yet, still a challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what kind of challenge is it?  Well, it seems to me that it is somewhere between a puzzle-solving and a creative challenge.  You have this structure which is (a) random and (b) partly unknown and then you have rules to manipulate the structure, both imposing order and revealing the unknown.  You manipulate it, trying to get to an end state with certain properties.  The unknowns and the randomness often make this difficult, sometimes impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could <i>totally</i> use the same model for an RPG.  I'd just have to figure out a structure, and rules for manipulating it, which would help to highlight the behaviors we're all looking to do in the game.  Rather than focus the game on trying to beat the other guy, you can focus on trying to move either your personal puzzle (if it's a more self-oriented game) or a group puzzle (if it's more group-oriented) or <i>both</i> toward a beautiful/ordered end-state.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99285/#Comment_99285" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T13:59:04+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  1:59PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was a kid, I had a (oddly) book of games entitled "Beyond Competition."
