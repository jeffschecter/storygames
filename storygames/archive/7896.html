Insisting on following the rules, to see what they would do. In hindsight, I've been like an apprentice, learning from strict mentors through the games they designed, as if they were sitting on my shoulder while I tried to fathom their visions and run their games. Some were idiots, some were brilliant, and I've learned from all of them. Sometimes I was an idiot, sometimes I was brilliant. But what strikes me now is how many times I've played a game not to enjoy it, but just to <i>see what it does</i>.<br/><br/>I'll probably be doing that for the rest of my life. Learning techniques, picking up skills and ideas, trying them out, believing in them for a while, throwing them away when they're no longer useful. Returning to the core sometimes, other times going out to explore again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175040/#Comment_175040" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T05:48:01+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  5:48AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>But what strikes me now is how many times I've played a game not to enjoy it, but just to<i>see what it does</i>.</blockquote>\nI don't think the two are necessarily mutually exclusive. I mean, I know I get enjoyment out of seeing how a system actually works when you get it up and running.
