Critique is something you learn how to do. It's got System and everything. I learned how to do this studying art in college and you might have too. It's a powerful tool, but if you misuse it, it makes you an asshole, whichever side of the crit you're on. So here's how to maximize the helpful and minimize the ass.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is exactly one reason to give criticism: you are helping the creator make their thing better.</li>\n<li>No one cares if you like it. That's not what this is about.</li>\n<li>Seriously! "I like it" or "I don't like it" is hollow grandstanding and self-importance. Cut it out.</li>\n<li>Tell the creator the <em>effect something has on you</em>. "A conflict took 20 minutes." "I don't understand what the difference is between these resources." Stuff like that. Don't tell the creator what to do. Ever. You can suggest solutions if you've thought about them, but be completely prepared to offer them and let them fall.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Conversely, the creator has to follow these rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Listen to every piece of criticism. Even the most ignorant, stupid asshole might give you a good idea if he says enough stupid shit.</li>\n<li>Don't do what people tell you to do. Do what you need to do to have the effect on them you want.</li>\n<li>Don't stay in love with your ideas if they're stupid. If everyone's telling you that something isn't working, <em>it isn't working</em>. Maybe you need to change how it works, maybe you need to change what you want, or maybe you need to scrap that idea altogether.</li>\n<li>Never, ever defend a decision. If someone asks you why you did something, tell them. But you're not here to defend your work, nor are you here to explain everything to your critics. If they don't understand, then either they don't need to understand or you need to make it clearer in your work. Explaining it standing in front of your work getting angry isn't going to make the work better.</li>\n<li>Thank people. They're a resource for you to improve.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the critic is coming from a position other than helping the creator, it damages the interaction. If the creator isn't willing to listen, it sinks it altogether. So make sure, when you're giving criticism, that the creator wants critique. And when you're the creator, make sure that when you're asking for critique, it's what you're asking for.</p>\n<p>And if you're publishing, you're asking for it. So make sure that you've asked among people you trust first, wringing all the critique you can out of them first. Because the public is filled with the stupid assholes who test your rule 1.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129575/#Comment_129575" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T21:32:29+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  9:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, we've got games that explain conflict resolution without play examples, leaving people cold: They have guidelines for success, but don't have an example of a Good Conflict to help understand exactly the process, what you're supposed to do, in reality and all.<br/><br/>Likewise, here, I see a great framework, good pointers, but no solid example. :-)<br/><br/>In other words, could you (or someone) start it off, perhaps with a critique of something recognizable?

And it's now published. If I want to criticize the game, the person who I should direct that criticism to is you. Ultimately, you can choose to do what you want with it, but hopefully you'll engage it and consider solutions. Regardless of what you get out of my criticism, an audience member might learn some valuable lessons for their own products.<br/><br/>But they wouldn't have learned those lessons unless I'd directed that criticism at you, in the manner which JACN describes (with the intent of supporting you in improving upon your works).<br/><br/>In light of that angle, do you see yourself and John Harper contradicting at all? Because I surely don't. The target audience should be the author, because that's criticism, and whoever else gets something out of that... awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129624/#Comment_129624" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T01:38:37+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  1:38AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 1:40AM by John_Harper.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Joe, that's exactly what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Doing it "to help the community" is a fast-track to becoming a dick, IMO.

It was Actual Play. People posted about their sessions and described what worked and what didn't. Designers would post about their play and ask for advice on how to fix or deal with a problem they encountered. After a game was published, players would post about their play and places where the rules seemed problematic or didn't support the group.<br/><br/>It led to discussions based on concrete examples and real situations. It was grounded in respect because it was always about playing the game and learning to make that play better and more fun. <br/><br/>I think it's the best way to have a public, frank discussion of a game, warts and all, and also make that discussion useful to someone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129700/#Comment_129700" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T08:55:35+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  8:55AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Joshua Newman<sup>1</sup>.

This seems, to me, to be the creator and the critiquer turning their backs on the larger community.  Why?  Because I learned how to design games by reading games and reading games being critiqued and the creator responding to those critiques.  I think a lot of other people on these boards did, too.  I think there's a handful of people who got in on the ground floor of the indie movement and didn't learn this way, but instead learned in these intimate and one-on-one interactions (and there's a few more who want to be in that group).  That worked for you; great.  That doesn't then mean that the only purpose of critique is to give you what worked for you in the past.<br/><br/>(And before you respond defensively, please, take a moment to breathe and really and genuinely consider if there might be a kernel of truth in here.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Presence of an audience increases the risk that a critique will become a performance.<br/><br/>I've done critique as performance.  It sucks, and it is *so hard* to avoid.  I think that we all have the urge to be sparkling, funny and witty.  These impulses did not add value to my critiques, ever.  <br/><br/>I swore never to ever confuse critique and performance after I attended a large (70+ writers) paying workshop with a bitch-diva NYC editor.  She would crack jokes, sing little songs, and torment her customers with long ambling digressions before crushing them with a casual six-word dismissal.  If she got a chuckle or a laugh -- which she did often, because the room wanted to love her and impress her -- she fucking <b>preened</b>.  Her critiques were so furiously self-serving that I suspect they resulted in actual genital damage.  It was sickening.  It was not critique; it was critoradectomy.<br/><br/>I should note that I don't think anyone here is an asshole of that magnitude.  I'm just relating a formative experience.<br/><br/>Anyway, all that said, I do agree with Ryan, that there is value in having critical discourse available, especially after something's in its final form. I love reading designer and playtest notes.  But I think that John's creator-first-last-and-only attitude is less risky.  And ultimately, it should be left to the creator to decide how much of the public they want to engage with their work at the various stages of its completion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129811/#Comment_129811" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T15:06:09+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  3:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 3:06PM by C.W.Richeson.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That neatly sums up some of the frustration I was having.

Like I said elsewhere, I'm looking at a different sort of thing, and was bringing that to what I thought was a more general conversation than it was.  It might do all of us well to be explicit about what sort of critique/criticism/review we're referring to when talking about it -- there's a lot of missed implications on all sides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129884/#Comment_129884" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T19:10:03+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  7:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Her critiques were so furiously self-serving that I suspect they resulted in actual genital damage.
