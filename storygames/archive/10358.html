I'm still interested in how story creation and character action interact. In some games, a coherent narrative, if it happens at all, is simply an emergent property of play. In others, interactive story creation appears to be an integral part of the game, and character actions are judged to the extent that they contribute to a story. To what extent do you enjoy story creation and which games support this for you? Which games offer actual play which, when written up, would make no narrative sense, but are still enjoyable?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230353/#Comment_230353" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T05:17:56+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  5:17AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2009 5:40AM by GB_Steve.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not found any games in which the emergent narrative makes no sense. It often doesn't read well but it usually has a logic that works for the characters involved. The trouble is that they are probably not the characters you'd chose as the basis for a story, and certainly not the number of characters. Harry Potter, for example, has three player characters and even then, Ron doesn't get a whole lot of air time. There are probably very few good novels with five or six main characters, especially when all of them are in pretty much all of the scenes (as they are in D&amp;D).<br/><br/>That said, I do enjoy story creation and even in games where it's not the focus (such as D&amp;D), I'm interested in narrative satisfaction even to the detriment of my character. By which I mean, I won't always chose the easiest, most productive option when there is something that feels more right for the story. And I guess, because I'm doing this on purpose, it would be hard to make a claim for the rules being solely responsible for story. If the players are interested in developing a cogent narrative, then you'll get one.<br/><br/>As an aside, most D&amp;D adventures are plotted to the extent that before the game starts you can pretty much say what is going to happen in each scene, and the order in which the scenes will occur, especially if you're familiar with the players and their characters. So the D&amp;D narrative is likely to be like a read through of the scenario and succeeds and fails on how it is written as much as the contribution of the players.<br/><br/>We played in an RPGA sanctioned game in Blackpool one year and came up with many solutions to the issues raised in the scenarios that hadn't been considered by the writer, such as using locate object and fly to find a missing item in a city. The durations of both at low level were sufficient to easily cover an area many times larger than the city. The GM kept putting extra barriers in our way because we solved things too quickly. And because he wasn't a very good GM, the barriers were obviously just that. As such the narrative would have been sucky but still understandable, if you included the GM as a trucculent,  interferring but rather dim deity.<br/><br/>I guess to a certain extent you might find that games which seek to control the narrative direction produce less natural narratives which don't make so much sense without the agency of narrative control being included in the story. So if we're playing Ganakagok and it's all about fighting the ice demons and half way through I (as GM) decide to interpret a consequence card as a particularly good walrus harvest, it won't necessarily make much narrative sense without assigning agency to that decision. The players usually have characters which be used to explain agency but the GM often must operate by more shadowy means.<br/><br/>So I seemed to have come round in a circle and answered my first point. Narratives make sense if you can explain agency. In traditional games, this is down to the GM not cocking things up. In narrative games, everyone has to be on the ball, although it's not usually very difficult.<br/><br/>We played Cold City with the same characters at two successive Gen Cons. In the second one, I asked if the story could be about my character stealing Joshua's character's magical powers. There was a bit of dissonance in the middle as we tried to work out a way in which that could happen without deprotagonising anyone and still making the story interesting. It worked to a degree although it was a bit strange playing a character with a plan when I as his player didn't know what that plan was but knowing that all the other characters had accepted it. There was somewhat of a gloss.<br/><br/>And here's <a href="http://asithappens.tppr.info/journal/2009/9/7/narrative-bugbears-joe-stalin-and-clap-o-mania.html" rel="nofollow">a link</a> to some thought about narratives and when it is safe to stop clapping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jan" title="Jan"><img alt="Jan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://api.ning.com/files/aMCvJWa*119KpxWfJKRX3wq*4TaoGdbPDFLD2u-xwv3UxkjerE6mt2*bPXjTPEakxlyfWEOhLHh83PvGpr4dR0WqgIT-CrY4/madmansig.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;crop=1%3A1"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jan">Jan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230360/#Comment_230360" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T06:50:34+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  6:50AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me first address your last question:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite> Which games offer actual play which, when written up, would make no narrative sense, but are still enjoyable?</blockquote>\nIn my opinion, every roleplaying game allows for the creation of a narrative. The question is not, whether there is a narrative or not, but how good is it? How much sense does the narrative make and how terrific is it? Actual play can usually be interpreted in ways that allow to understand it as a more or less coherent narrative. However, not every sequence of scenes amounts to a cool, gripping or well made narrative (even if it is possible to tell the underlying story). Regarding the plausible motivations of character action, for example, or the meaning of conflicts there is a huge variety of ways to advance the narrative - from more or less shallow and boring ways to the absolutely breathtaking and heart-shaking ways.<br/><br/>That said, I think that it's usually not the case, that a really cool story emerges just from character action. Or more precise: a good story emerges from character action only, if you place the characters in situations that allow for dramatic and meaningful choices, heroic or tragic action etc. So, I think that a good story only emerges, when cool characters are situated in an exciting context. And without someone who provides the right context (of course "somenone" can be the whole group of players) the chances are pretty low that the actual gives rise to a good narrative.<br/><br/>Now to your other question:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite> To what extent do you enjoy story creation and which games support this for you? </blockquote>\nI really enjoy story creation and try to advance the story in every roleplaying game I play. Probably every game allows for story creation, but some foster it by means of system. If the system necessitates that scenes have a meaning for the characters (as in PtA or WGP for example) the chances that a sequence of scenes amounts to a good narrative are much higher than in systems which allow for scenes which are devoid of emotional impact on the characters (like D&amp;D or Shadowrun). Of course you can create a great story using the rules of D&amp;D. But in cases like this it's not the system that helps you with the story creation.<br/><br/>In addtion, a system can foster story creation not only through scenes that adress character issues but also by providing a story arc. Anyway, for me that's not really an important tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230361/#Comment_230361" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T07:00:56+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  7:00AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2009 7:03AM by Graham.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>Which games offer actual play which, when written up, would make no narrative sense, but are still enjoyable?</blockquote>\nMany games of Paranoia are like this. You're sent on a mission, then I accuse you of something, and you shoot me, and everyone else joins in, and then we all explain why we're innocent to someone else.<br/><br/>You <i>could</i> argue there's a narrative, but only in the sense that any chronological sequence of events has a narrative. Really, it's just fun moment-to-moment, rather than by considering the story.<br/><br/>Also, I think that many games only make narrative sense in retrospect. At first, we're just a bunch of pirates fighting. Later, it becomes obvious that the Captain's the villain, and everything so far has led to bringing him down. (It wasn't really leading to that, but it seems that way in retrospect.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230362/#Comment_230362" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T07:02:38+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  7:02AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a big fan of story creation, mostly because I enjoy writting and If I wanted to make a cool story (as apposed to playing a game) I would go make a cool story. (Hey I got one in the next Protodimension Xine that's how cool they are <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>)<br/><br/>I enjoy games because they give me an excuse to hang out with friends and play within a shared social confine. The story that comes, doesn't have to be good, oftentime it works a lot better if its bad, because just like we told dm's way back when, a game is really in my opinion a horrible place to try to make a story (and making a game that works better at it, makes it a worst game often). Story games tries to get arround this with talking about being 'invested in the fiction' and having 'shared creative agenda's' but really what that is saying is that, as long as everyone's willing to put up with a poor game for an okay story its okay, which is not nearly as interesting as you think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230369/#Comment_230369" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T07:35:58+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  7:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But that also happens when you read narratives, you don't know who Kaiser whothisname is but when you do it all makes sense in retrospect, but it could easily have been someone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230376/#Comment_230376" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T08:18:38+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  8:18AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2009 8:19AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon: I really feel a need to play more games which create a story structure.

So <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i> is the story of the two titular characters, minor personages from <i>Hamlet</i>. As long as they aren't on stage with the major characters, they are free to act as they will (kind of... it's the point of the play to explore to what extent this is really true). But from time to time, Shakespeare needs them on stage to advance the plot, and so suddenly Hamlet shows up and R&amp;G speak with the Bard's voice instead of their own, and act out their predetermined fates. This is definitely one way to impose a certain kind of structure on the emergent story; choose your <i>Hamlet</i>, pick out a Rosencrantz and a Guildenstern, and tell their story, occasionally cutting back to the events of the source material.<br/><br/>See also: Montsegur 1244. Sorry, but I think that disqualifying it as a witness is a form of special pleading. Also, flash-forward and other forms of predestination in play (v.

The key would be editing. Especially if you look at the game as a first draft brainstorm. <br/><br/>What makes for a good story? To me it is:<br/><br/>- a message (doesn\u2019t have to be deep)<br/>- events that communicate that message indirectly (show, don\u2019t tell)<br/>- patterns that make those events believable and build expectations<br/>- expectations that are heightened, challenged, twisted, or broken to keep your attention<br/>- pacing information so you aren\u2019t underwhelmed or overwhelmed<br/>- ending in the allotted time<br/><br/>Out of the games I\u2019ve personally played, Mouseguard probably comes closest to facilitating the above out of the box. I played an earlier version of Misspent Youth before the story structure elements were introduced so I can\u2019t comment on those features. <br/><br/>In our Cthulhu games, we hack the game and build scenarios specifically with the idea of encouraging the above. To do so, we will:<br/><br/>- choose a message<br/>- design pre-generated characters to address that message<br/>- design a situation that presents a problem that brings the characters together around that message, presents obstacles that keep everyone from ending the game in the first scene, and enforces an in game time pressure so tings wrap up in the allotted time<br/>- create a social contract where everyone tries to keep things mature and logical by self editing themselves (asking themselves if their choices would be entertaining if we were watching this as a movie)<br/>- eliminating non crucial information from the player\u2019s character sheets so that the focus is on fewer elements that are tied directly into the situation to encourage reincorporation<br/>- GM acting as director to enforce pacing<br/>- empowering the GM to introduce improvised obstacles in direct response to players actiosn<br/>- hacking the system so that failure can be replaced with success + consequence<br/>- giving the characters proper motivation so players can suspend disbelief<br/>- reward those motivations by making promises (mysterious information, power, insanity, glorious death scenes)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230424/#Comment_230424" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T12:36:42+00:00" title="September  7, 2009 12:36PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jenskot, this approach would be particularly useful if you wanted to make an actual play recording worth listening to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230428/#Comment_230428" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T13:59:05+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  1:59PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somebody, I'm not sure who, once remarked that there's a strong structuralist tendency among many of the Forge-influenced designs.  I think that's certainly true, but it's not the whole story. I think there are a number of things in tension (surprise!).<br/><br/>There's the emotional catharsis streak in which "stories" are only created if somebody's mental or emotional tension gets developed and/or resolved somehow.  This is often associated with jargon like "Narrativism" and Luke's assertions that moral issues are central to roleplaying and the central tenants of Jeep.<br/><br/>There's the structuralist trend, which is all about the trappings of narrative traditions, generally those outside of roleplaying like fiction, theatre, and movies.  This is where we get "scene framing" and ensemble characters and endgames and pacing mechanics and even straightjacketed narratives like the ones Chad apparently hates and the HUGE emphasis on reincorporation as a technique (that's why characters have traits, yeah?).<br/><br/>And what happens with straightjacketed structuralist games is that the "story" happens on the moral/emotional level, since the events are largely pre-scripted.  Hello Montsegur 1244, yes we see you there in the back.  But, on the other hand, I think there are plenty of games where moral/emotional investment isn't nearly as important as the trappings of story, whether you consider this "Sim" or "Nar lite" or what have you. Certainly, one-shots of PTA certainly fall into this camp for me, where I don't really have a huge investment in the moral or emotional issues of my character(s). Long-term play is probably different. Also, Universalis is the poster child for extreme competitively-determined structuralism, probably.<br/><br/>Most games and playstyles, of course, fall somewhere in between. You have some structural elements and some moral/emotional elements and you emphasize different things at different times or depending on your personal and group preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230448/#Comment_230448" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T16:27:17+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  4:27PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This talk of straightjacketing confuses me.

"We found out about the minotaur.  We fought our way to the minotaur.  We almost killed the minotaur but Kevin ran out of healing spells and we had to run away."  To a veteran D&amp;D (or whatever) player, the story will make sense.  We understand that the tension is not just in heroes fighting a bad guy, but in characters negotiating risk and their own limitations.  Healing spells take on a meaning that is not merely mechanical, nor merely literal.  It has a specific meaning in the experience of play about when you use your resources, when you take risks, and how you deal with the consequences of your decisions.  I'm not sure what to call this (any forger want to give me some jargon?) but it doesn't seem like a level that receives enough attention.<br/><br/>If your goal is a game that recreates a readily accessible narrative structure, then perhaps you're looking for something a bit more like improvisational theatre.  Improvisers know their characters (usually based on stock tropes), they start a scene with a problem, and they're all dedicated to resolving that problem and ending the scene.  The question is HOW it's resolved, and that's where the element of play enters.  Perhaps this sort of structure:<br/><br/>James Bond Meets the Villain<br/>James Bond Uncovers the Plot<br/>James Bond Infiltrates the Lair<br/>James Bond Nearly Dies<br/>But Then He Doesn't<br/>James Bond Saves the Day<br/><br/>To tackle the problem GB Steve points out, that this tends to focus on one main character (or a few at most), perhaps no one plays James Bond?  Perhaps people play those who support Bond on his mission (quest, journey...).  You could even have classes: traitor, seductive woman, fellow agent, false friend...  Bond movies differ in how these supporting cast interact, not so much how Bond fares.  Does the woman live?  She gets killed sometimes.  Sometimes the traitor is found out.  Sometimes the false friend decides to support Bond for real.  All of the players agree that James Bond is going to succeed, but who gets best supporting actor?  Who has to be sacrificed?  For a particularly cinematic experience, play could rotate somewhat.  Not every supporting character is going to be in every scene.  Players could use a system that allows for more narrative control.  "After visiting his lover, James Bond decides to contact his friend, Agent 009, to chase up a lead..."  I'd still have a GM to play the villain, his thugs, and occasionally Bond (responsible primarily for Bond making blinding obvious errors and crude sexual puns).<br/><br/>I agree with jenskot's points.  If you want a coherent narrative, with a beginning, middle, and end, with a rise of tension and a final resolution, everyone at the table needs to be aware that that is a goal and actively work towards it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230459/#Comment_230459" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T19:05:06+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  7:05PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2009 7:18PM by Keith Sears.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When professional screenwrtiters create a story, they follow a structure. So, why can't this be applied to a roleplaying game? A structure acts as a container and shapes the content you produce. I'll use the plot point structure I use in Dream Palace as an example:<br/>\n<br/>\n1, First Image - The opening image establishes the initial setting and mood for the movie. Is it gritty and run-down? It is bright, but cheerfully plastic? Is it viewed through the veil of nostalgia?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Setup - This part of the movie let's the audience get to know the characters' lives before all the fun begins. All Characters should be introduced or hinted at.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Catalyst - An event happens that disrupts the character(s) normal routine. It is the invitation to adventure or something that forces him out of normal life.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. No Turning Back - Something happens that launches the character(s) directly into the adventure. This might be a conscious decision or something forcing the character(s) into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Midpoint - The Protagonist reaches his Goal, but it is a false success. The stakes are raised.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Reversal - The bad guys regroup after the Protagonist's \u201csuccess\u201d and close in.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. All is Lost - An event occurs that forces a crucial decision. The Protagonist is in a worse condition than when the Movie started. However, it is a false defeat.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Turning Point - The audience realizes that the main character(s) have changed or figured something out.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Showdown - This is the climax where the Protagonist and Antagonist square off.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Final Image - Establishes the change of mood at the end of the movie. It is supposed to contrast with the First Image.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis all can be applied to just about any movie-style story, and appropriately flavored. For example, the First Image would be the "Cold Open" that the Bond series where JB wraps up his prior mission.  It gets the audience ready for the action coming up in the rest of the movie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230483/#Comment_230483" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T01:27:48+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  1:27AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heraldic - this is exactly what we were doing, in both the general sense and for particular genres.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230519/#Comment_230519" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T07:15:08+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:15AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heraldic: this is also exactly what <i>Misspent Youth</i> does (with slightly different details).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230526/#Comment_230526" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T07:25:32+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In improvisational theatre, the idea is that planning a story loses the tension.

Later actors lost their allies usually to emphasise how evil the bad guy was.<br><br>So if the players play the supporting cast, there is still tension for them because they have the survival rate of Star Trek redshirts.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231496/#Comment_231496" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T00:33:06+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:33AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James,<br><br>That model is so cool. I'd play the hell out of such a Bond game. I think PTA is the way to go, but drifted so it works with a single story arc instead of the episode structure thing. Probably a one-shot game, yeah?<br><br>All the supporting cast has a question hanging over them, like in Montsegur 1244, except it's a different question for everyone. The false friend has "Will I be able to betray him in the end?", the woman has "Will I get him in the end?" and so on.<br><br>Totally awesome, and a good example of how you can do structure without straightjackets.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
