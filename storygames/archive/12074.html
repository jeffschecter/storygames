It's tagline would be something like, "Massive Collaborative Fiction and Roleplay."<br/>\n<br/>\nInfluences include:<br/>\nDe Profundis -- indie correspondence game<br/>\ndiscussions at the Forge<br/>\nAelyria -- massive play by post<br/>\nFaery Tale Online - little browser based rpg<br/>\nLost the TV series<br/>\n<br/>\nThe forum will break down into three main areas:<br/>\n1. The Setting - This is where players write the history, ecology, and so forth that make up the setting. Writings must be given a frame of reference (a context), which means that there is an in-game author (whether PC or NPC, living or dead, famous or anonymous) and a location for where that writing can be found (e.g., a scroll in a library or inscribed on a the walls of an ancient ruin.)<br/>\n2. The Characters - Threads summarizing the principle and supporting characters, I.e., PCs and NPCs. <br/>\n3. The Events - This is the forum area that most resembles a typical pbp rpg. It is where the action happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe twist that I refer to in the topic is that there is no absolute canon for the setting; events played out can occur anywhere in time and need not be continuous with other events, which result in multiple worlds/alternate timelines.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying the game would mainly consist of creating the setting (in forum #1) and playing out events with one's character (in forum #3).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe duties of a GM would be shared amongst the players with a minimum of official forum moderation. My working idea here is that the thread starter of any thread in forum #3 would be the default GM for that scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny questions? Please let me know what you think! My feeling is that it could benefit a lot with some rules additions I've never heard of.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270586/#Comment_270586" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T06:28:45+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  6:28AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing that occurs to me is that very quickly, the source material will grow to be so great that no one will keep track of it all.  And the game will stagnate as a result.  But, depending on how you mean to implement the multiple worlds aspect of things, that might be somewhat eased.  Maybe if you had a structure something like: three Setting elements are combined with some Characters to form an Event that is then played through.  And maybe one of the Setting elements can be swapped out for a previously played-through Event for contiguity where that's desired.  Something like that might lift the burden of the massive Setting.<br/><br/>Have you seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon_(game)" rel="nofollow">Lexicon</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270604/#Comment_270604" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T10:27:36+00:00" title="May 10, 2010 10:27AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the response!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes! I have seen Lexicon, and I'm glad you mention it. It was in my mind, rolling around with the other things, and I was thinking it would be really great if entries used hyperlinks to other relevant entries, like Lexicon. Reference to other entries (with or without hyperlinks) will be a key part of keeping the game together, actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay someone starts a thread describing an historic battle, making up names for where it was fought and who fought it. If nobody else plays off that material and refers to it, the thread will fade away as if the battle was forgotten in history (or never happened at all). So, actually, it's not important that all the source material be kept track of. The most relevant, interesting source material will be kept alive through reference and used in play. The rest will drop away as chaff, the theory goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that will be enough to stave off stagnation induced by excessive source material?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270610/#Comment_270610" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T11:22:28+00:00" title="May 10, 2010 11:22AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno.

(Stalling in the beginning is more critical than stagnation at the end.) I think we can avoid stalling in the worldbuilding if we approach the worldbuilding as playing instead of something done prior to play. I'll address Christopher's questions and you can tell me if you see something that fixes the tendency of writing projects to stall.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Setting section, inspired by De Profundis, writings must have a context. I foresee it as being good form to have a header at the beginning of each thread saying something about the context, e.g., "An excerpt from the Tome of Yolar, in the Library at Limpardos..." or alternatively, a date and addressee together would frame the entry as a letter. Players could follow up in the same thread with entries in a different book on the same subject or as replies to the letter. The special advantage of having an in-the-fiction context for all of history, ecology, and geography in this way is that it makes it all subjective and open to interpretation-- perfect for a game with multiple timelines. Conflict will arise about what "actually happened" when newly discovered texts reveal lies by omission, or retell a history, swapping the oppressed with the oppressors. Play might revolve around making a set of accounts consistent or more "real" than a conflicting set of accounts. Some players may write most of their words in the Setting section.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Character section would be the smallest. In this section, players have sole authorship over their PCs, one thread for each primary character. This is a chance for players to collect together the elements of Setting and Events that define their characters as they see them. Retconning is allowed and encouraged. In situations when timelines for a character dovetail and the character has multiple realities, these can be delineated and contrasted. Supporting characters or NPCs might be grouped together by relation, with shared authorship. There could be guidelines for how an NPC might become a PC, (i.e., shared authorship to sole authorship) and vice versa. I see entries as being encyclopedic in format with lots of links/references to Setting and Events.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Events section may be the slowest to get started (need Setting and Characters first, right?) but could become the biggest if a lot of players join up. It would probably have some guidelines typical of most PBP RPGs (e.g., no bunnying?) but have a couple novel things. Borrowed from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.aelyria.com/" rel="nofollow">Aelyria</a> (and emphasized) is what they call Fluid Time, which allows a character to be played simultaneously in threads (scenes) that occur at different places and times. In Aelyria a player is limited to 3 threads and a span of time, but I don't see a need for a hard restriction like that in this game. It's up to the player of the character to keep scenes separated by time and distance logically consistent, if desired. The other novel thing besides Fluid Time is the role of the GM: whoever starts a thread is the de facto GM with the typical duties of describing the environment and controlling supporting characters. Conflict resolution would be primarily Karma/Drama, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nYay!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270883/#Comment_270883" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T01:14:41+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  1:14AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2010 1:35AM by Aumpa.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To say a little more about playing in the Setting area, the creation of new setting elements might be for the purposes of 1) bringing consistency and emphasis to already existing setting elements, 2) giving your character the desired background, 3) preparation for running Events specific to the new element.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an example of how the forums and sub-forums might break down:<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>General Meta Discussion</u><br/>\n<u>Setting</u>[ulist]Letters &amp; Journals<br/>\nMyth &amp; Religion<br/>\nHistory, Geography, Law<br/>\nLanguage<br/>\nEcology<br/>\nThe Stars, Magic, Invention<br/>\nArt &amp; Music[/ulist]<u>Characters</u>[ulist]Era 1<br/>\nEra 2<br/>\nEra 3[/ulist]<u>Events</u>[ulist]Era 1<br/>\nLocation A<br/>\nLocation B<br/>\nLocation C<br/>\nEra 2<br/>\nLocation A<br/>\nLocation C<br/>\nLocation D<br/>\nEra 3<br/>\nEtc.<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing really holding me back from actually starting up the forums is having a name, but I'd also like to hear more suggestions, questions, comments, and criticism before I do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270929/#Comment_270929" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T08:52:52+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  8:52AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who's responsible for the basic genre/theme decisions that have to be made before you can even start worldbuilding and making characters?

Since there is no "present" in the Character section, a character could, for example, be introduced on their deathbed, and scenes from their life could be played out in the Events section as flashbacks. One element of the character "sheet" could include requests for a GM to play out certain scenes. <br>\n<br>\nSo, say I create Hagar, an aged tribal chieftain. I could note some key moments that I would like to play: 1. His first battle and initiation to manhood, 2. The day he succeeded his father as chieftan. 3. The day he received a crippling wound, marking his retirement as a warrior. For each event, I would describe who he is, what he believes, and what his goals are. We the players know how it all turns out, but what is in question is how he will get there.<br>\n<br>\nIn those scenes, Hagar would be a principal character. I see the GM's role as setting the scene to challenge who he is, what he believes, and present the stakes.<br>\n<br>\nI mentioned before that a player has sole authorship over a character in the Character section. It's allowable for players to create written accounts in the Setting section that may include tales of Hagar and his tribe. Also, in the Events section, I think it will be allowable for players acting in a GM role to borrow Hagar as a supporting character, which may carry some limitations and guidelines.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273631/#Comment_273631" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T02:42:15+00:00" title="May 30, 2010  2:42AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why must a Pbp game be a sprawling fantasy epic lasting for an indefinite amount of time?

But I don't mind talking about this in public, either.<br><br>My previous experience with PBP projects involved 5 - 10 players. The rules weren't specifically designed for PBP because there <i>weren't</i> any rules. We were approaching it as Writers doing a Writing Project rather than as Gamers playing a Game. I think that was a mistake. <br><br>The rest of the group had written together before, a successful project that lasted (I think) a couple of years. When I joined up with them, it seemed like they were trying to recapture their past success without any kind of discussion about <i>how</i> they'd been successful in the past. Just about any kind of question I had about procedures, even things as basic as "If our characters get into a conversation, who gets to decide what my character says?" was brushed off with, "Oh, it'll all just work itself out somehow."<br><br>It didn't.<br><br>Everyone introduced their characters and then just sort of sat there spinning their wheels, waiting for someone else to make something happen, to push for some sort of conflict or introduce some sort of overall plot. I made some stuff happen to my character, just to give myself something to write about, but I was afraid to turn it into a "real" plotline because I didn't know if I was supposed to be off doing my own thing or if I was supposed to be looking for ways to involve myself with the other characters. Apparently, neither did anyone else. When I suggested on the OOC forum that maybe we should start talking about ways to get our characters together and have them do something, most of the members said that was a good idea and then sat back and waited for someone else to start. One guy freaked out and demanded we move all that discussion to a super-secret hidden forum so he wouldn't be tempted to read it and "spoil his surprise". I was the new guy, so I didn't want to push it. <br><br>Everyone wallowed through a couple more pointless, meandering story posts and then most of the group dropped out because they were "too busy in real life."<br><br>We tried again a year later. This time, two of us came up with a tightly focused premise guaranteed to create lots of opportunity for conflicts between the characters. When we presented it to the rest of the group, everyone seemed enthusiastic. I still didn't have the slightest clue how we were supposed to actually <i>handle</i> those conflicts, and no one else seemed willing to talk about it, but as it turned out, it didn't matter. The game stalled out after a few weeks of pointless world-building. Or rather pointless discussions <i>about</i> world-building, since very little of the world actually got <i>built.</i> Everyone made plans to discuss making plans for a while and then once again became "too busy in real life". <br/><br/>Busy bunch, these guys.<br/><br/>Another year or so later, we tried again. This time we tried more of a shared world approach: a basic setting and a single plot event that people could involve their characters in if they wanted or ignore and do something else entirely. I think that approach showed promise, but unfortunately we just didn't have enough players to get any real momentum going. Only a few of the players from the previous projects were interested, and most of them <i>flat out fucking lied</i> (It's possible I'm still a little bitter) about their level of enthusiasm. They claimed to be excited to participate but when the time came to actually write, their posts were short, lackluster, just plain <i>bad writing.</i> Nowhere near the quality of the stuff they'd contributed to previous projects. And while I certainly don't expect players in a PBP to try to impress me with their writing skills, I <i>do</i> expect them to write like they <i>care</i>. These people didn't.<br/><br/>Luckily, my disappointment was short-lived; once again, most of the group became "too busy in real life."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274189/#Comment_274189" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T20:05:43+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  8:05PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing.

As Ron mentioned, it was definitely set-up as more of a collaborative writing project rather than an RPG and there really weren't any rules.  At one time, I think we maxed with about 12 players.  The whole thing lasted about 2 years (which sounds like a pretty good run compared to other projects).<br/><br/>Since there wasn't a GM or a direction, it could get fairly elementary and clunky.  Someone might write a post about how their character was waiting at an inn; the next post would be from another contributor and basically introduce the characters to each other.  It was up to the individual writers to decide which threads with which they choose to involve themselves.  As we became better acquainted, there would occasionally be some basic plot discussion off list so 2 or 3 characters would have an idea where that thread was heading.  The style also allowed for people to write independent posts and to drop in and out as needed (except of course when you're in a conversation with someone and waiting for a reply!).  We allowed other contributors to manipulate our PCs within reason, always with the idea that the player who created the character would have the final veto if someone wrote their character into an untenable position and that entry may need to be edited.<br/><br/>As far as world building, whomever "called" it first was basically in charge.  For instance, if I said my character was from We-Hate-Trollsland in the West with the capital of Fairies Rock...then it would be up to me to kind of ...make sure any additions from other contributors fit in with what had already been written about that area.<br/><br/>If you have any questions; just ask.  Your idea of threads where the GM gives the basics of what is going to happen, but allowing others to join in sounds much more focused than the we tried it!<br/><br/>Oh...and I'm interested in your game, if you'll have me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274647/#Comment_274647" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-05T00:07:06+00:00" title="June  5, 2010 12:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the input, Ron's girlfriend!<br/><br/>Aelyria (the long running PBP I keep mentioning) gives GMs jurisdiction over a geographic area, which makes sense for that system.

The game had lasted so long and was so active owing, I observed, to a very defined premise and structured hierarchy: <i>You are a functionary of Kingdom X, you must lead what forces you have to victory against the other kingdoms. Player Y is the over-all leader of your kingdom, but Player Z is your C.O. Discuss plans with him.</i><br/>While there appeared to be GMs it seemed that they only facilitated battles and war-gamey resources. The structure of play was very much in the hands of the player-factions. I think having clear expectations/goals for the narrative contained within the premise would increase the wieldiness of the game - otherwise it's sandboxing with no compass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274700/#Comment_274700" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-05T18:58:12+00:00" title="June  5, 2010  6:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Potemkin</cite>I think having clear expectations/goals for the narrative contained within the premise would increase the wieldiness of the game - otherwise it's sandboxing with no compass.</blockquote>\nThat's a good point. In older iterations of this project, there was more in the way of goals and premise. It evolved into what I've presented here, with less premise, but more free form.<br/><br/>Initially, I thought the game would start without any established civilization or cultural history in one of a number of scenarios: 1. the characters are colonists on an alien planet with collective amnesia of their home caused by a side effect of being in cryogenic freeze during the voyage. 2. the characters are new beings created by gods, left to make their way in a new world. 3. the characters are newly awakened gods at the start of a cosmogony, free to create the world and populate it. 4. something else involving amnesia and a new world.<br/><br/>Cliche as it is, the reason I like amnesia in a new world is because it represents the baseline of the game: minimal setting background. Playing the game is as much a process of discovering the past as it is of creating the future.<br/><br/>Another element of goal/premise that gradually vanished along with the above was the idea that all new characters had to begin as the children of already established characters. This required one of the above scenarios as a way to seed the world with the first characters. The fiction would be about the cultures of and interactions between small tribes. The more the distinction between PC an NPC dissolved, the less appropriate it seemed. That, and it was just too limiting.<br/><br/>At this moment, I'm planning on using scenario <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> above as the premise for my first entries in Setting and Events. There will still be room for other players to create other civilizations with culture and history and characters that remember their pasts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deme" title="Deme"><img alt="Deme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deme">Deme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274837/#Comment_274837" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T08:20:09+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  8:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...you're looking more sci-fi?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274903/#Comment_274903" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T16:45:14+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  4:45PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A medium-fantasy of human tribes and nature spirits in a distant earth future is what is inspiring me at the moment, so that's what I'm going to launch with.<br/><br/>While I think the principle of having no canon would work fine with hard SF, or SF-based time travel and alternate dimensions, I'm concerned about how to resolve possible conflict between dissonant metaphysics.

Why Earth, and why distant-future earth? <br/><br/>It seems to me that a story that takes place on Future Earth puts more emphasis on the setting than one that takes place in Fantasyland. In addition to the normal fantasy setting questions of "How does this place differ from the world we know?" and "What does that mean for the characters who live there?", setting a story in Future Earth also raises the question, "How did we get from here to there?" The farther into the future you set the story, the more important that question becomes: set a story ten years from now and you get to make a few conjectures about technology and politics while still writing about people who are exactly like us; set a story ten <i>thousand</i> years from now and you're pretty much <i>required</i> to make a number of Powerful Statements about the nature of humanity. Heck, just assuming for story purposes that humans will <i>exist</i> in a form recognizable to us is Making A Statement. Humans in your distant future might be totally extinct, they might have transcended every limit of nature and remade the entire universe into their concept of Paradise, they might be exactly like us, they might be pretty much like us only with gills and the ability to metabolize Styrofoam. But they can't be <i>all</i> of those things. By choosing one, you're making a statement about humanity; you're saying "because humans are <i>this</i>, they'll turn out like <i>that.</i>"<br/><br/>All of which is really cool, but I don't know if that's really the kind of story/project you want to do. It sounded more like you wanted to write about <i>characters</i>, rather than Big Ideas About The Future -- which is cool with me, because while I dearly love drinking a few beers and talking about Big Ideas, I totally suck at turning them into stories. I love to read SF, but I'll happily leave the <i>writing</i> of it to the experts.<br/><br/>Now, if you're taking a more Thundarr the Barbarian approach to Future Earth, where it's still set firmly in Fantasyland, but with some recognizable ruined Earth landmarks scattered around for color, that's different. And fun. There's still going to be a fixed canon though, namely all of Earth's history up until today. And the question of "How did we get from here to there?", even if it's de-emphasized, is still going to be there. At the very least, if you're going to write about human tribes and nature spirits, you or <i>someone</i> is going to have to decide when and how these nature spirits arrived. Even if you'd rather just focus on the current interactions between humans and nature spirits, the fact that the story is set on our Earth means that there was a time in the story's history when there <i>weren't</i> any nature spirits (or people couldn't see them, or didn't believe in them, or had forgotten about them, or whatever). Setting the game on Earth means you need to <i>account</i> for the appearance of nature spirits in someway; in Fantasyland, they can always have been a part of the world.<br/><br/>Hmm. Going back to your amnesia idea, what if instead of all the characters having amnesia (which seems clunky and heavy-handed, kind of like starting a D&amp;D campaign with "OK, you're all naked in a jail cell") there's a cultural or historical amnesia?

Why Earth, and why distant-future earth?</blockquote>\nI want to frame it, or ground it, in something we know, but yet be different. I want humans. And I want players to have the opportunity to have flashback's to our known history. I think a parallel universe to earth, like Narnia or Amber, could work just as well.\n<blockquote>It seems to me that a story that takes place on Future Earth puts more emphasis on the setting than one that takes place in Fantasyland. In addition to the normal fantasy setting questions of "How does this place differ from the world we know?" and "What does that mean for the characters who live there?", setting a story in Future Earth also raises the question, "How did we get from here to there?" The farther into the future you set the story, the more important that question becomes: set a story ten years from now and you get to make a few conjectures about technology and politics while still writing about people who are exactly like us; set a story ten<i>thousand</i>years from now and you're pretty much<i>required</i>to make a number of Powerful Statements about the nature of humanity. Heck, just assuming for story purposes that humans will<i>exist</i>in a form recognizable to us is Making A Statement. Humans in your distant future might be totally extinct, they might have transcended every limit of nature and remade the entire universe into their concept of Paradise, they might be exactly like us, they might be pretty much like us only with gills and the ability to metabolize Styrofoam. But they can't be<i>all</i>of those things. By choosing one, you're making a statement about humanity; you're saying "because humans are<i>this</i>, they'll turn out like<i>that.</i>"</blockquote>\nAh yes, Making Statements. This hadn't really occurred to me. I think that whatever Powerful Statements I make are going to be part of a process of discovery for me.<br/><br/>From what I've presented so far, do you think there can be room for any player to have a go at making a Powerful Statement? I hope so. I don't want to do all the Statement Making just because I get the first turn.\n<blockquote>All of which is really cool, but I don't know if that's really the kind of story/project you want to do. It sounded more like you wanted to write about<i>characters</i>, rather than Big Ideas About The Future -- which is cool with me, because while I dearly love drinking a few beers and talking about Big Ideas, I totally suck at turning them into stories. I love to read SF, but I'll happily leave the<i>writing</i>of it to the experts.</blockquote>\nYes, I think play is mostly about the characters, especially concerning the Events and Character sections. The Setting can be employed for developing characters, too. But...\n<blockquote>Now, if you're taking a more Thundarr the Barbarian approach to Future Earth, where it's still set firmly in Fantasyland, but with some recognizable ruined Earth landmarks scattered around for color, that's different. And fun. There's still going to be a fixed canon though, namely all of Earth's history up until today. And the question of "How did we get from here to there?", even if it's de-emphasized, is still going to be there. At the very least, if you're going to write about human tribes and nature spirits, you or<i>someone</i>is going to have to decide when and how these nature spirits arrived. Even if you'd rather just focus on the current interactions between humans and nature spirits, the fact that the story is set on our Earth means that there was a time in the story's history when there<i>weren't</i>any nature spirits (or people couldn't see them, or didn't believe in them, or had forgotten about them, or whatever). Setting the game on Earth means you need to<i>account</i>for the appearance of nature spirits in someway; in Fantasyland, they can always have been a part of the world.</blockquote>\nI'm staunchly opposed to canon for the game! Even in regards to our own history. There could be alternate histories, see. There could be branching and converging timelines about what the big apocalypse was. There could be multiple and contradictory explanations about how and why nature spirits appeared.<br/><br/>A key thing just occurred to me! I want the <i>characters</i> to have to struggle with all the questions you ask above. I want to see different cultures and religions with different explanations for all of those things without the players being able to refer to a canon to know which of the stories that the characters tell themselves is the correct one. I want to see diverse player-made cultures emerge in the setting, and I think a laissez-faire approach to the characters' big questions is the best way to allow for that.<br/><br/>That, I think, is a hidden kernel that I've been planning around.\n<blockquote>Hmm. Going back to your amnesia idea, what if instead of all the characters having amnesia (which seems clunky and heavy-handed, kind of like starting a D&amp;D campaign with "OK, you're all naked in a jail cell") there's a cultural or historical amnesia? Earth used to be like it is now; everyone knows stories of the old days, when the Ruins were still a bright and thriving City, and Book And Torch Woman was still alive and patrolling the harbor. Then Something Weird Happened and the world became as it is today, but no one,<i>not even those who lived through it</i>has any memory of what that Something Weird was. Since players are free to write about whatever time they want, some might choose to focus on events right after the big change, doing post-apocalyptic or rebuilding society stuff, while others could choose to write about events farther in the future, doing more typical fantasy stuff with the remnants of Old Earth as background color.</blockquote>\nYeah, that sounds great. I hope the opening scenes I offer aren't too cheesy. If they are, we can adapt!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275453/#Comment_275453" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T00:06:12+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 12:06AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2010 12:14AM by Aumpa.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Trevis</cite>I wrote a PbP game which you can find<a href="http://wiki.trevismartin.org/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisionistHistory" rel="nofollow">Here</a>and I have had at least one Storygamer whoplaytested it and seemed to like it.<br/><br/>I've always wanted to do a game of it based on Max Brooks'<i>World War Z</i><br/><br/>Maybe you'll find something useful for what you're doing.</blockquote>\nThis is really great, thanks!

I figure it like this. The process of play that shapes the fiction has constraints on the players. Those constraints allow for certain things in the fiction and disallow others. This framework for play is sort of like the metaphysics for the fictional universe. So if genre, flavor, history, geography, and characters in the fiction were all undefined, there is still <i>something</i> defined by the constraints, if only metaphorically and vaguely. At that point, it seems to me that the distinction between canon and not-canon is not really useful anymore anyway. So I'm calling it moot.<br/><br/>I have been hesitant to move forward with launching the game because I still have some nagging uncertainties. In particular:<br/><br/>1. I am not satisfied with how I envision play proceeding in the Events section. There, the de-facto GM is whoever started the thread, but what are those GM roles, exactly? I've thought that it should be something about challenging the characters' understand of themselves, and how that understanding contrasts with their beliefs and goals. But how to do that?<br/><br/>2. With multiple realities, I am a little worried about things going gonzo. What is gonzo? Is it always bad? How can it be minimized?<br/><br/>Somehow I feel that that answers to those questions depend on this principle:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is the power of the players to respond to (even ignoring) other players contributions towards the fiction.</span> This is a possibility with PBP that is not really available over the table. If a GM does not like a player's offered resolution in the fiction, she can alter it in that thread, changing the outcome in the fiction. If a player does not like a GM's resolution, he can stop posting in her threads. Similarly, if a player posts gonzo stuff in the Setting section, it can be ignored or re-imagined in a player's own posts.<br/><br/>Is this crazy? Is my doubt founded? Or should I just go ahead and start the thing like I said I would almost three weeks ago?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277192/#Comment_277192" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T21:02:57+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  9:02PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Aumpa</cite><br/>Somehow I feel that that answers to those questions depend on this principle:<span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is the power of the players to respond to (even ignoring) other players contributions towards the fiction.</span>This is a possibility with PBP that is not really available over the table.

Roll initiative!<br/><br/>The player proposed a contribution to the fiction: their character making friends with the dragon.

But if a player doesn't like the scene, it does not have to be added to the character's timeline in the Character section the way it was depicted in Events. And if all players of characters in the scene choose not to add it to their characters' respective timelines, than the whole scene is effectively nullified, or merely a dream sequence at most.<br/><br/>In the Setting section, there is no GM designation, so the power to ignore or alter is evenhanded.<br/><br/>So say there are three characters sharing a common experience in a thread in Events. The player of one character chooses not to add the experience to their character's timeline in the Character section, but the other two players do. If characters with conflicting experience of the past meet, they may end up calling each other liars. Call it a rift in the spacetime continuum or whatever, but to an observing party, it will merely appear as the word of one person against the word of one (or more) other person(s).<br/><br/>"Affinity" could be a game term: it is the degree to which characters have compatible timelines. I do not have a mechanic for it yet, but perhaps characters with low Affinity cannot be played in the same threads. This would be ruled on by the GM of a given thread.<br/><br/>In all three sections, Setting, Character, and Events, the degree to which players share a common fiction is the degree to which they are playing the same game, you might say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277270/#Comment_277270" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T08:30:27+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  8:30AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, it strikes me as passive aggressive.

So forgetting to update one's character information is not sufficient. There would have to be something contradictory to call it an actual timeline divergence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277378/#Comment_277378" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T15:20:23+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  3:20PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'm just missing something (probably because I'm trying to follow  this thread in brief bits of downtime at work) but it seems like you have a specific solution in mind for a problem you haven't really defined yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277385/#Comment_277385" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T15:33:51+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  3:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you thought about putting together an idealized example of play, showing just how you'd like players to interact, and then trying to come up with methods for encouraging those behaviors?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277390/#Comment_277390" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T16:05:06+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  4:05PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an earlier post you mentioned challenging the other players as a GM role.

lurking in some threads, finding some relevant stuff.<br/><br/>In particular, I found <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11849&amp;page=1#Item_31" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> to be really interesting in respect to setting creation, and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12308&amp;page=1#Item_3" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10303&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> to be relevant to everything.<br/><br/>At the moment, my question is: <br/><br/>Is it fun for a player to advocate for their character's success even in a free form, low-to-no mechanic system where the GM both presents the challenge and rules on the outcome of conflict? I think it could be, right, as long as the GM keeps in mind that, while they are challenging the characters on the level of their self-image, beliefs, and goals, they do not want to interfere with a character being Awesome. Right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277749/#Comment_277749" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T17:23:39+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  5:23PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>I'm thinking both fictional challenges (" Such and such happens in the fiction.

It's simmering.<br/><br/>I'm starting a side game as a player in a freeformy pbp that I expect will play in a way similar to play in the Events forum for this game. I'll see what perspectives I get out of that.<br/><br/>When it's ready for launch, would it be appropriate to plug in the Directed Promotion of S-G?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12074/pbp-with-a-twist" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12074/pbp-with-a-twist" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12074/pbp-with-a-twist/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12074%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12074%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
