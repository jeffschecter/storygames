Unfortunately my copy disappeared into that place where socks, tv remotes, keys, and other things that you put in a "safe place" go when you try to find them again.  Jackson graciously sent me a replacement copy thereby guarenteeing that I would actually follow through on my promise to play it.  And so I have.<br/><br/>The book currently is a slim staple bound volume with a one page play aid sheet.  The first couple of pages are the rules that tell you how to interact with the cards, the rest of the book are the entries for the cards themselves.  You play with a standard playing deck and look each entry up in the book as you draw it.  The story starts out briefly, you are dreaming, and in your dream you find yourself in a house (and its surrounding environments), your heart is missing and you must find it...go.  Each card represents either a location (a room in the house or a spot outdoors), a character you can interact with (and who will possibly join you on your quest), a small item you can take with you, or a card that changes the state of the game (like from day to night).<br/><br/>You draw each card one at a time and look it up in the book.  The entry includes an evocative title like "The Hollow Lady" or "The Pines" and a snippet of flavor text and then the rules for what to do with the card.  I violated the games advice to not read through the card entries in advance because I wanted a better idea than the example gave of what an entry actually looked like.  Initially I thought the amount of flavor text was lacking, a mere couple of sentences with no motivations or characterizations, or anything.  Upon play, however, I quickly realized this was a feature.  Since you can draw the cards in any order, who they are and what they mean, and how the character's behave will be strongly set by the context of your particular path through the deck.  Any more flavor text would make it increasingly hard to pull the elements together into a story.  Because, ultimately that's what you do, write the story yourself.  I initially set out to record my card draws and mechanical choices just so I could give appropriate feedback to Jackson, but before I'd even gone through a half dozen cards, my sparce entries were being fleshed out with imagery I provided.  I didn't just "find a key and put it in my inventory", I "stepped on something cold and hard in the dark, and groping around blindly found a small key, old and worn"  When I had to drop an item because my inventory was full, I didn't just "drop the photograph" it "fluttered from my hand taken by a strange draft".  That flavor wasn't supplied by the entry in the book, it was supplied by me so automatically and intuitively that I didn't even realize at first I was doing it as I wrote my notes.  When I did realize it, I was so excited that I determined to write my notes up as an actual short story inspired by the game.<br/><br/>Mechanically the game centers on the deck which serves many purposes.  It is a pacing mechanic ensuring steady progress through "encounters".  It serves as a map.  In the house in my story the kitchen led to a hall with a library, dining room, and ball room at the other end...because that's the order those cards were in in my deck.  But most impressively, it serves as the literally mechanical mechanic behind the game.<br/><br/>When discussing design you've probably heard ideas like "if you're going to use cards instead of dice, you should take advantage of the features that cards offer that dice don't".  Well Jackson didn't just take advantage of the unique feature of cards, but even more so, the unique features of stacking those cards into a deck.  The most important rule of the game is that after the initial shuffling, you never ever shuffle the deck again.  When you cycle through cards you place them on the bottom of the deck in a very particular order.  Usually the exact order you drew them in, but sometimes the rules for a particular card will have you switch them around to powerful purpose.  I found it easier to have a discard pile and then just flip the discard pile over when the draw deck ran out, but that's because I was also writing down the story as I went.  If you play with the deck in your hand like for most solataire games its probably easier to just stick the cards right on the bottom of the pile.<br/><br/>The effect of keeping the deck in the same order creates an actual geography where time and distance in the story are measured out by the the seperation of the cards in the deck.  In my story you have to go past the Thicket to get to the Pines and beyond the Pines lies the Lake...because that's the order of the cards in my deck.  The geography of your deck will be different.  In my story I spent a good bit of time in the house, and then a good bit of time outside the house...because in my deck most of the house locations were in the early part of the deck and most of the outdoor locations were in the later part.  In your story you might find yourself running in and out of the house regularly if your indoor / outdoor locations are interspersed.  In one instance it didn't feel right to me to "run outside" to interact with a location I'd just drawn, so instead I observed the location through the window, adding my own flavor text because that just sounded better to me.<br/><br/>The true genius of this deck mechanic is realized after your first couple of times cycling though it and following the card instructions.  7s are secret passages.  They allow you to skip a number of cards in the deck...cycle through them maintaining their order, but not interact with them.  Genius feature <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> comes from the fact that you put the 7 back at the bottom of the deck last, after the cards you skipped.  Thereby ensuring that your next pass through the deck you will see those cards and skip a different set of cards.  Genius feature <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is that you get to choose how many cards you skip, so your next time through, when you find that same 7, you'll know what cards are coming up next (because you saw them last time) and can choose the right number to skip over cards you don't want to interact with this time.  It effectively gives you the sense of randomizing the order of events without actually shuffling.  Some cards trap other cards.  When you get to that card you automatically cycle it and 1 or more other cards to the bottom of the deck, preventing you from ever interacting with those cards, until you find a way to untrap them.  Sometimes what you do with a card depends on what you are carrying or who you are with.  If you have a particular item you skip the text about automatically cycling the next card in the deck and do something else instead...thus releasing the trapped card.  Some characters will react to you one way if a particular companion is with you, but a different way if someone else is.  Many cards change what they do (or even what they are) when you interact with them.  On the play sheet there are spaces where you "mark" a card when the rules tell you to.  The next time you interact with that card, the entry will tell you to do something different depending on how many marks the card has.<br/><br/>There is then a whole other layer to the game that I haven't even explored yet.  In addition to the main deck, you can create in play many smaller piles.  Cards can get sent to the Thicket pile, or wind up in the Monster Horde Pile or the Lake Pile.  You can leave cards in various Empty Room piles and pick them up again later.  Due to the way the cards passed through my deck in this game I had very little interaction with those piles.  Many of the cards that would have populated them were skipped.  Other cards that would have triggered pile related effects were trapped behind other cards and I never managed to free them.  This tells me that replayability for this game will be high, much higher than one would expect from a solo "choose your own adventure" sort of game.  Not only will shuffling the deck for a new game change the order of card interactions, but there are entire areas of the game that I didn't even see this time that next time, with a different card order, might wind up driving the entire game.  <br/><br/>The only pile I got to interact with much was the Lake pile.  Since I had the Sword card in my inventory when I reached the Lake, the entry for the Lake gave me the option to throw my sword in.  Doing so took the Sword out of my inventory, placed it on the Lake Pile and marked the Sword card on the play sheet.  The next time I reached the Lake, I had the Brass Witch as a companion, a horrible character who won't let you pick up any new items as long as she is with you, and will only go away if you let her eat one of your items (IIRC this permanently removes the item from the game).  But...if you have the Brass Witch with you, the Lake entry lets you do something different, you can throw the item the witch wants to eat into the lake and she will jump in the lake after it.  Doing so takes the Witch out of your inventory and puts HER on the Lake pile as well.  Here I misinterpreted the rules and thought I could keep doing stuff at the Lake, when really I should have left and come back (i.e. waited until I drew the Lake card again the next time through the deck) but what the Lake entry also lets you do is throw any other item into the lake.  If you do you get to find the Waif card in the Lake pile.  The Waif card is the same card as the Witch Card, but only after the card is marked is it the Waif (i.e. unmarked the card is the Witch, marked the card is the Waif, and the only way to mark the card is to get the Witch to jump in the Lake...you're starting to see the genius here, right?).  If you find the Waif she will join you and bring the bottom card from the Lake pile with her.  The bottom card in my lake pile was the Sword card (cuz I'd thrown it in the first time through).  But now the Sword card was marked...so it isn't the Sword anymore, now it's the Legendary Sword.  <br/><br/>Yeah, that's right.  If you manage to do things in the right order, you can throw your sword into the lake, find the witch, trick her into jumping into the lake, which allows you to find the waif, who will bring you the sword which is now a magical sword capable of driving off ghosts and defeating the monster lurking in the house.  <br/><br/>That's just one example.  There are a number of these subroutines that can be unlocked in the game.  I stumbled across part of at least 5 of them, but the Lake routine was the only one I completed before finding my heart and ending the game.  Next time through I hope to take the axe to the Thicket and find what's trapped inside, or take the boat to uncover the monster horde.  I never did get to interact with the Wolf Girl because she spent the entirety of my game imprisoned by the Merchant King who tried to sell her to me, although I couldn't afford his price.  Yeah...the Merchant King...he's cool.  He traps an ever increasing number of cards so that you can't interact with them unless you buy them from him.  I suspect the flavor of the Merchant King will change dramatically depending on what sorts of items he winds up having for sale...but in my game...several of the major characters were "his"...meaning the fat jolly Merchant King was something of a slave trader.<br/><br/>(cont'd)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239906/#Comment_239906" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T10:23:55+00:00" title="October 31, 2009 10:23AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2009 7:00AM by Valamir.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you can't tell yet, I'm ridiculously excited by this game.  Not only is the specific Smoke Dream story pretty interesting with crazy characters and nifty things to do, but the core engine of the design has nearly limitless possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeriodically in the annals of story game history there comes a game that completely defines an entirely new paradigm of play and what play looks like.  I think Polaris did that, I think Capes did that, and more recently Misery Bubblegum.  Add The Smoke Dream to the list.  This is perhaps the most radical innovation to be seen in story-game land since the Jeep Form invasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to read the 4 page short story inspired by my excursion into The Smoke Dream you'll find it at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ramsheadpublishing.com/index.php?module=Pagesetter&amp;func=viewpub&amp;tid=1&amp;pid=7" rel="nofollow">my Ramshead site</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239907/#Comment_239907" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T10:54:17+00:00" title="October 31, 2009 10:54AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I completely agree: The Smoke Dream is a radically innovative game with lots of potential for the future.  It's not flawless, but then, radically new things usually aren't.<br><br>I think the monster that chases you is my favorite subroutine of the whole game.  If you can somehow distract it, you put it back in the deck, but only a few cards off, so it's still on your trails.  Until you can find a way to kill it or otherwise escape completely.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239969/#Comment_239969" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T23:03:40+00:00" title="October 31, 2009 11:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!<br><br>To be graced with such amazing refferential works-  thank you.<br/>I've emailed the link to your story to my design house personnel, they'll be very glad to read how you dove into it...<br/>i really like how you've not included your mechanical inspirations from the game, simply your fiction.
