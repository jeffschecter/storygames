Oh my, yes, the jargon factor is high.  Much of it is inherited from Burning Wheel, of course.  For example, the physical stats include "Forte" (toughness), "Power" (strength), "Agility" (manual dexterity), and "Speed" (agility).  For reasons I can't fathom, a handful of N six-sided dice is noted as "Exponent N" instead of "rating of N", or "[N]d6", or "roll [N] dice."  Dice that are not successes (i.e., rolled 1, 2, or 3) are called "Worms" instead of failures.  The points used for advancement and special effort are called "Artha" instead of experience, or hero points, "Field of Related Knowledge" (FoRK) instead of related or complementary skill, "Wise" skill instead of knowledge skill or lore, etc..  This is compounded by the fact that the sci-fi setting also uses its own share of specialized vocabulary, of course; newcomers to both the setting and the system have a hard time remembering all these terms.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAll of these terms (and presumably more) are referred to as "jargon".  Jargon is usually defined as terms or language for a specific field used to intentionally confuse those unintiated with the language.  First, I do not believe the above is really "jargon" at all, but beyond that I've seen a somewhat distrubing trend to label any terminology that isn't from a traditional gaming text as "jargon", which has undertones of pretentiousness and of being outside the realm of the normal consumer.  I've begun to believe that this has simply become a buzz word by those who aren't necessarily indie game supporters, much in the same way "liberal" was a buzz word in the mid-2000's, and that it has the same net effect of pushing people away who might otherwise be interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo am I off base here...would you call this stuff jargon?  Do you think we should hew closely to the well worn terms of other games, even if different terms might be more effective communication tools?  How do you turn the tide on buzz words, like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82104/#Comment_82104" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T16:16:23+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  4:16PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Augh!

Honestly, for later games, I dropped the terminology and just said things like "Roll your [whatever] skill and get X successes.]  With yhat said, I think that's a valid complain for Sophie to make in her review.

I'm familiar with both BW and BE and the terms "worms" and "exponent" were chosen for good reasons, at least in my estimation.  You can ignore them, of course.<br/><br/>Exponent - A skill rating doesn't just have a number.  It also has a "shade" of black, gray or white.  Thus, exponent was a term coined to differentiate one part of the rating from the other.  You could ask "What is your rating?" and have the person answer "B5", if you wanted.  But if you are talking about the number specifically, the term "exponent" is more precise.  After all, some things affect only the exponent and some things affect the shade of the rating.<br/><br/>Worms - Pure color.  Worms are what the Vaylen (the bad guys) are called in the game.  I tend to ignore this term but color is a valid reason for choosing to use it<br/><br/>The rest of the objections are bogus as hell.  All sorts of different RPGs have different names for their attributes and abilities.  Why should BW and BE be judged differently.  FoRK's is just an acronym for crying out loud.  Who wants to say "Fields of Related Knowledge" all the time.  Hell, Fields of Related Knowledge, while somewhat longer, isn't any less clear than Related Skill.  Sheesh.  Where is this review?

Of course, all the terms defined in D&amp;D are jargon too.  That's the case with any game that defines it's own terms.  Using jargon as a negative point to a game is just a way to say, "I don't like this game." without having to think too much about it.  After all, you could say it about any game, including D&amp;D, WoD, whatever.  This particular reviewer had other things that were more insightful to say about what she didn't like about BE.

I agree with you after a fashion, Andrew, that perhaps these terms could be considered jargon, but as could most of the language in any roleplaying game, yet the word never gets used in conjunction with larger press companies.  For instance, as someone who followed the transition from oWoD to nWoD you notice that some of the same ideas and thoughts have been renamed from iteration to iteration, sometimes in somewhat confusing fashion (such as using Gnosis in Mage, versus Werewolf), and while it didn't stand as a barrier for me and my play group it was a large set of linguistic changes that could've been avoided.  Without getting into the merits of these changes (as I think they had merit, as do the linguistic changes in BW/BE), I saw very few instances of the word "jargon" come up.  So Jason, I guess I respectfully disagree that there isn't some sort of double standard going on here.  Its okay for WotC to talk about skill synergy, cause there the big dog, but using Fields of Related Knowledge jargon is okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nC.W., I do think that a review of work should use context of its past and peers to define its relative worth (which to you was pretty high), so if the reviewer feels that there is more or less "jargon" in this game shouldn't they use better examples than the above?  It seems disingenuous to cite these examples and call it "jargon", considering we are in a hobby with sci-fi enthusiasts who break down non-existant technologies, and fantasy gurus who can tell you the name Tolkein gave the first Valar's dog!  Should the use of the word "Forte" really be considered "jargon" in the context of our hobby?  I don't really think so, but I think it has become so easy to label indie games this way and for some reason it sticks.  You write very good reviews C.W., as did she, but I want to make sure that as reviewers there isn't an invention of linguistic conventions in the hobby, because there never was.  Sure we've accept "d6" and "die pool", but if someone wants to call a die pool a clutch of pipped rocks to make their game better, and its clearly understood, than I'm not sure we're in jargon territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82203/#Comment_82203" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T07:08:33+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  7:08AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Tyler!<br><br>How about this: Not only indie games, but many games make use of specialized terminology that can make understanding and presenting the game more difficult.  White Wolf is a classic example of a game producer who tends to do this.  In order to make a game as accessible as possible a designer should avoid special terminology unless it adds a lot of flavor, is clearly explained and useful, or really does represent a more unique concept in the game.  Not to pick on anyone, but take Seth's Legends of Alyria as an example.  I think that game is loaded with cool stuff, but I had to go over the rules several times to finally figure things out because of strange terms that I simply couldn't wrap my head around.  That's a problem - if I, a guy who reads tons of games, can't figure out the core mechanics until I draw out sketches then there's something wrong.  In the case of Burning Empires, the word 'exponent' flat out scares my math adverse players.  While I love FoRKs because I think it's intuitive once you understand the concept, and I can understand the reasoning behind exponent, I find it to be another conceptual step to teaching the game.<br/><br/>Keep in mind I'm just wanting to illustrate how new terms can be a problem.  I like special terms fine, but there are some circumstances where they can be a problem (such as redefining common terms in an already robust game).  I liked Burning Empires, I think it's a great game, but in this reviewer's actual play experience (she tried running a campaign) these terms were a problem for her group.  I think that's a pretty good basis for saying the terms may be a bit much - she's not just guessing and trying to illustrate a concept like I am, but it *was* a problem in her group's play.<br/><br/>Ultimately I think we agree but are kinda talking past each other.  No one wants a game so loaded with weird terms that people have trouble understanding it, and no one wants to read Vanilla: The RPG of Attribute + Skill Dice Rolling.  As with most things, there's a range and some games may push <br/><br/>All that being said - I think if the reviewer had said "special terms" instead of "jargon" a lot of the discussion here would disappear.  Don't do the geek thing and get hung up on definitions and what the right word is where you understand what the reviewer is trying to communicate - that these terms made things more difficult for her group.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82268/#Comment_82268" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T10:14:05+00:00" title="July 19, 2007 10:14AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Jargon thing is usually aimed at Indie Game Theory, not the games in particular. That is, I've seen as much bashing of non-indie RPGs for the use of original terminology as I have of indie games. And I agree with it by turns. Hollyhock God for GM in Nobilis? That's just more color than I want to swallow. I think there is such a thing as taking things too far.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, actually, I'd say that Luke totters on that edge. But, as Jason says, Luke does that intentionally. His games might be a lot dryer without some of the color he adds with these terms. Playing BE with him at GenCon, we were regularly bemoaning the number of worms we'd rolled. It's just fun to say, "Aaagh! Look at all those worms!" right after you drop the dice for a bad roll. These terms certainly have a lot of weight for Luke, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the term Jargon itself goes, it's often given a negative connotation, but, in fact I believe that Jargon has legitimate uses beyond the social exclusion that's often associated with it. I mean, sure, doctors could refer to the Gluteus Maximus as the butt, but, whereas the butt is ill defined, the Gluteus Maximus is not. It's not just a shorthand in this case, but terms that have agreed to specific definitions that make it possible for discussion to occur about a subject with less miscommunication. And it can give focus to a discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the extent that something in a RPG is unique to that RPG, it makes some sense, then, to have a new term for it, so that people can understand that referencing the term refers to that particular specific defintion, and not some similar concept. I think we all agree that terms of this sort make sense. It's only when the term is created clearly for color that we all start to wonder. And sometimes it's iffy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Sophie (or whoever wrote the review) apparently Luke went overboard in her estimation. That's a valid criticism, to me. A subjective and local one, but that's part of criticism, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82328/#Comment_82328" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T14:13:09+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  2:13PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I destroy every piece of color I can find in games anyway, so weird jargon doesn't bother me.

(Also, if something is the same as an existing concept, I'll make sure I use the existing term.)<br><br>Another point, related: as more games are produced, a lot of everyday words get "used up". I originally was going to call my reroll mechanic Twists (an uptwist when rerolling failures, a downtwist when rerolling successes). However, Colin is using Twists in Sufficiently Advanced to mean something completely different (and more intuitively obvious, I think, though I can't just now recall exactly what it is). So my term Twists has two strikes against it now: It's not immediately obvious what one is, and it will potentially confuse people who've played Sufficiently Advanced.<br><br>Hence, Twists become Rerolls, divided into Rollups and Rolldowns. Or even "rerolls of successes" and "rerolls of failures", but I think Rollups and Rolldowns is probably clear enough once explained, and more concise.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82347/#Comment_82347" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T15:07:01+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  3:07PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think there is a good deal of value in designing such that you have to name the fewest amount of things!

E.g., I've seen a tendency to borrow terms from other games, give credit and maybe quote a passage, as if this economizes on the amount of rethinking, rewriting, and relearning that has to happen before the player gets the concept. And I think it's the opposite: referring to another game creates more confusion as it gives the impression that there's a Platonic ideal out there, independent of your game, which needs to be researched by reading other games or discussing it endlessly on discussion boards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82363/#Comment_82363" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T16:50:22+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  4:50PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2007 4:55PM by MikeRM.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point, Elliot, thanks - when using an existing term, that doesn't mean I shouldn't explain the existing term as if my readers haven't encountered it before (as I mentioned on another thread, talking about the terms "GM" and "NPC" and how they get used without definition in game texts). If they have encountered it before, they'll quickly realize as they read the explanation, "Oh, this is like in TSOY" (or whatever) and move on; if not, the explanation is necessary for them to understand it.<br><br>Shreyas, I'm not sure what you mean by "complimentary distribution". Rollups and rolldowns in the Pentasystem are complementary, yes, but the distinction is important. You invoke a rollup by describing an advantage you have relating to the attribute you're using, it costs you a point, and you reroll a failure; you invoke a rolldown by describing a disadvantage, it gets you a point, and you reroll a success. I think that justifies making a distinction, and having specific terms.<br><br>But the thread is TOTALLY DERAILED at this point, and if we're going to continue we should start a new one (since people with no interest in the topic of this thread may have some interest in our discussion). I'll do that.<br><br>Edit: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3668" rel="nofollow">Using specialized language for your game mechanics</a>.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
