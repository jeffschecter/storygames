Jacobson</cite>How does [Agon] make every ability relevant to play?</blockquote>\nThis was a key design goal for the game, which I tried to solve in a couple related ways:<br/><br/><b>1. Closed ability list.</b><br/>There are 16 abilities in Agon, no more, no less. No one, including the GM, gets to create any more. This helps make the abilities relevant because the closed list defines the entire scope of activities that the game system cares about. The ability list answers the question, "What do I do in this game?"<br/><br/>To put it another way, the game is about earning Glory. You earn Glory by engaging in contests. The abilities tell you what kinds of contests you can have.<br/><br/><b>2. Each ability has a defined mechanical effect in relation to the reward cycle.</b><br/>Check out pp. 64 &amp; 65. In addition to the general action of the ability that you use in most contests (Orate is the ability to affect others with speech) there's a special mechanical function for each ability that impacts the core activities of the game. For example, Orate is used to determine who will lead the hero group. Music gives a bonus when you refresh abilities. Cunning is used for tactical maneuvers in battle. &amp;c.<br/><br/>Since Agon is a game that is played out as a long series of interactions with the game system (everything is a contest), this makes each ability important during the course of the game. There are no pure "color" abilities, in other words, or abilities that the GM must create a special scene around. The stuff covered by the abilities is the <i>only</i> stuff you will be doing during play, and each of those things always impacts the reward cycle of Contests &gt; Glory &gt; Quests &gt; Fate.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D. Jacobson</cite>Isn't it still incumbent on the GM to take note of the specific abilities of the PCs and respond accordingly? E.g., if a character "maxes out" on oratory, it wouldn't do to have the GM pose only obstacles like golden boars, raging rivers, and ascensions of Mount Olympus.</blockquote>\nNope. That's not how Agon works. The gods hand down their quests, and the GM comes up with some objectives for the heroes to accomplish. The objectives are not set in stone, though, and they are not specific contests. They're just a guide for the GM to fall back on as material to introduce if the heroes get stuck. The heroes decide where to go and what to do to complete the quests, and by taking action they say what their characters are doing, which then sets the stage for certain types of contests. In Agon, it's not the GM's job to pre-plan specific contests that the heroes have to make, only to create opposition for whatever the PCs decide to do.<br/><br/>So you <b>don't</b> look over their sheets and see what they're good at and then try to plant stuff in their path that will provide opportunities for them to shine. Never, ever do that in Agon. <b>Finding opportunities to use their good abilities is the players' job.</b> It's an important one. And there's lots of fun to be had when two heroes disagree about the next course of action because one of them is really good at Hunting and the other is really good at Athletics and they have to settle it with an Orate contest. Which they then lose to a third hero who starts an oath bidding war to see which hero he will support with his leadership. :-)<br/><br/>Hmm. I have to step away from the computer. I hope that's enough to answer your question. If not, maybe Shreyas or Fred or someone will drop by and explain further.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91435/#Comment_91435" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T15:47:04+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  3:47PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it isn't so much that the system forces every ability to be meaningful, as much as it is that the players are made to decide which abilities they want to be meaningful in any given quest?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91471/#Comment_91471" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T20:09:08+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  8:09PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 8:17PM by Remi.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey John,<br/>What about the Named Character battles?

John is right to say they cover all the actions you should do in Agon.<br/><br/>Heal is quite useful (You get Glory for Healing someone in a contest, and can also withhold healing for Oaths). I don't think there are any 'dump stats', but I am confused by John's claim that you shouldn't build multiple challenge types into your adventure. The players CAN choose courses of action that are optimized for their skillsets, and this absolutely should be allowed. The Quest components are a general structure, not a specific map. However, I think in terms of certain, unavoidable encounters (If you're charged to Kill the King Wyrm, for example), you should be aware of the skills at the table, and perhaps not always hit the same skills with every challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91604/#Comment_91604" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T08:09:45+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 8:11AM by Remi.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas: If it's BEFORE the battle, yes, you get Glory.

I've said elsewhere that Agon holds the honored place on my nightstand so I can read it before I lay head to pillow at night. I'm pushing hard because I know John will push equally hard right back, and I'm hoping to learn a thing or two.\n<blockquote>In classic D20, if I want to use a flute on goblins, I have to get the GM's approval on whether and how it works.

How exactly do they react?</blockquote>\nI don't think that's a perfectly accurate description of d20 (at least not as I play it--I'd have to comb through the DMG to see what the specific direction on this issue is). Bard says I'm going to play my flute to lure one of the goblins away. The GM says roll the dice and then narrates a result based on the roll. Yes, the GM might say that's a really hard thing to do, but I think characterizing it as prior approval isn't quite right.\n<blockquote>Does<i>Passages</i>move away from that Mother-May-I model?</blockquote>\nIn this important sense: When the player wants his character to do something, he proposes -- not the rules -- which of his character's modifiers apply: one attribute, one skill, and any applicable advantages. The Narrator can veto absurd applications, but creative uses are encouraged.

In a d4 vs. d10 conflict, the d4 only wins 15% of the time. (I'm not exactly a probabilities wiz, so someone with more ammo in that department should probably check me on this.) But that's not really the question is it. What we want to compare is the likelihood of success against the target number. So we'd have to compare d4 vs. 2d6 [the Antagonist's "generic" roll] against d10 vs. 2d6. I don't have the time or wherewithal to crunch those numbers. But it's even thornier than that because we'd have to try and compare that disparity to d20, but we don't know what DC to use as a point of comparison. Acch! Brain exploding.<br/><br/>I do get the idea that, in D&amp;D, there are some things that one character simply cannot do because they couldn't meet the DC even with a 20. Whereas in Agon, breaking the rules for a moment, a PC with an ability of d4 could <i>theoretically</i> succeed at anything--even an obstacle where the Antagonist is rolling, say, 50d12. And I get that it is an important distinction that bears on this conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91900/#Comment_91900" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T15:56:50+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  3:56PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Justin, don't forget that you always get your name die.

I go away and my thread explodes. Cool.<br/><br/>Many things to respond to here. First, thanks to everyone for answering questions for me. You all know Agon well and are sexy rockstars whose names will be remembered forever.<br/><br/>First: <b>Remi!</b> You are doing everything right. If I said anything that made you doubt your Antagonist-fu, it was my fault in how I communicated it. Here's the thing: As Antagonist, you play your NPCs like a bastard! They want stuff, and they will try their damnedest to get it. So yeah, Odysseus ambushes those fools with his mad Oratory and kicks their asses. That is right and proper.<br/><br/>But what you don't have to do as Antagonist is fret over the skills in the hero party. You know how you did this when you ran D&amp;D? I know I did. Like, "Hmmm. No one is good at swimming, so I shouldn't screw them with an underwater thing. Bob's guy is good at Diplomacy... so I'll have some Diplomacy stuff for him to do in the next town..." <b>No.</b> None of that. Just make your cool island with quests and objectives that interest you and are full of colorful stuff. Don't worry about <i>how</i> the heroes are going to accomplish their goals. That's their problem.<br/><br/>Finally: <b>Yes, you do get Glory for contests of advantage, even in the middle of a battle.</b> You always, always get Glory for winning a simple contest and for being the high roller among the heroes. And yes, any other hero can join in your advantage roll with you, by narrating how their hero participates, just like any other simple contest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91988/#Comment_91988" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T23:22:32+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:22PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 11:35PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin: It sounds like you're getting yourself tied up in knots here. It sounds like you're arguing that the d20 and Agon skill mechanics are not different. <b>This is crazy moon talk.</b> Is that what you meant to say? Let's start there. If we can first agree that yes, they are different in many ways, then we can get into the nitty gritty of how they are different.<br/><br/>So. I propose that they are different. Do you agree? If so, check out this next part.<br/><hr/><br/>Here's the first big difference, which is relevant to my first post:<br/><br/>In Agon, every PC is very good at every single ability in the game. They each get their name die, plus any creative ability dice, plus any oath dice, plus any helping dice -- <i>before</i> their "skill level" is even considered. This means, in D&amp;D terms, that <b>every</b> PC is a well-trained Thief, Cleric, Magic User, Fighter, and Bard. No one has to put skill ranks in Perform and then hope that it comes into play often enough to justify that point expenditure. And also hope that points spent on Perform are as valuable to successful play as, say, Spot skill levels. And also hope that Perform checks have results that are non-trivial.<br/><br/>In contrast, every single ability in Agon can be used equally well to win contests and earn Glory, and the players decide what tasks the PCs undertake to accomplish their goals, thus guiding what abilities are called for in contests. Let me say that one part again: <i>The players decide what tasks the PCs undertake to accomplish their goals.</i> There is no "With the GM's permission" attached to that, just to be clear.<br/><br/>In Agon, the players say, "We compose a song to lull the beasts to sleep." The GM is not allowed to say no, that doesn't work. "Music doesn't affect them," or some such is forbidden. The only thing the GM can do is call for a contest, and she can make it a hard one (which costs Strife!), but that's the extent of her authority. And when you have a contest, you use your ability and you can win Glory. Thus, every ability is relevant to the direct purpose of play.<br/><br/>Contrast again to the Perform skill in D&amp;D. Is your Perform skill earning you XP as well as your Spot, Tumble, and Basic Attack Bonus? And who decides which of those skills is favored in terms of reward?<br/><br/>I hope I'm communicating clearly and the differences are highlighted a little better. Let me know if we're making progress toward understanding between us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91995/#Comment_91995" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T00:04:13+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 12:04AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NOTE: My Agon knowledge is limited. Extremely limited.<br/><br/>Killing the royal guard WILL earn you XP in D&amp;D.<br/>Lulling the royal guard into sleep MIGHT, MAYBE earn you XP in D&amp;D if the GM awards for creative problem solving and thinks this deserves it. Most GMs don't in my experience.<br/>Befriending the chief royal guard and getting him to let you through the defenses WON'T earn you XP in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Killing the bad guys will guarantee you XP in D&amp;D, where everything else is pretty poorly mapped out and up to GM discretion.<br/><br/>In Agon, I get XP for succeeding. At anything. If I want to befriend the chief royal guard and you say "I'm unsure if you can do that, let's test" then you are promising me XP if I win.<br/><br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Second thing: The DC for a skill in D&amp;D is determined by GM approximation of difficulty. Which means if a GM thinks playing musical instruments in the middle of a conflict is badass (maybe he played Zelda: Occarina of Time like twenty times), then he might say, "Yeah, I could totally see that happening! Epic lute, bitches! DC of 15."<br/><br/>Another GM might totally scoff and say, "Um, okay... you are going to play the fucking lute at the three headed cobra dog demon? You're not going to like... defend yourself and shit? I think you'll probably die, but whatever... DC of 40. And I'm so going to kill your fucking ass if you fail."<br/><br/><br/>In Agon, the Antagonist/GM has a budget. Making something harder COSTS. The limited resources of antagonism mean that it is less fiat. In some groups - no big deal, the GM isn't a huge prick or particularly biased to certain actions (and in such, certain classes and characters). In other cases, it might mean a world of difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Yes, we are talking about degrees and, I suppose, whether the difference is sufficient to reach a tipping point on this issue of GM/Antagonist attention being relevant to PC success.\n<blockquote>In contrast, every single ability in Agon can be used equally well to win contests and earn Glory, and the players decide what tasks the PCs undertake to accomplish their goals, thus guiding what abilities are called for in contests. Let me say that one part again: The players decide what tasks the PCs undertake to accomplish their goals. There is no "With the GM's permission" attached to that, just to be clear.<br/><br/>In Agon, the players say, "We compose a song to lull the beasts to sleep." The GM is not allowed to say no, that doesn't work. "Music doesn't affect them," or some such is forbidden. The only thing the GM can do is call for a contest, and she can make it a hard one (which costs Strife!), but that's the extent of her authority. And when you have a contest, you use your ability and you can win Glory. Thus, every ability is relevant to the direct purpose of play.</blockquote>\nI posed this up-thread and I don't think it was answered. My understanding of the rules is that: (1) the Antagonist can be the aggressor in a conflict, and (2) the aggressor decides what ability is relevant to the conflict. Isn't this contradictory to your "never" in the above passage?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Again, I recognize this as a difference between Agon and D&amp;D.<br/><br/>That's not really the point.<br/><br/>It seems like this thread has devolved into a comparison of Agon and D&amp;D (and I've contributed to that direction). But, really, that's an entirely different and relatively silly excercise. They're vastly different games on many levels.  Let's reflect on the original question: How does Agon make every ability relevant in play? I recognize the features it has in this regard, but I think it is overstating things to say that every ability is equally relevant in actual play and that the Antagonist has no role in determining which abilities are relevant in any given session. Maybe that's not what you are claiming at all. If all we are doing in answering the question is saying that it does a better job of ensuring this than D&amp;D, I recognize that as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92103/#Comment_92103" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T08:43:30+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  8:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm thinkng about this aggressor thing.</p>\n<p>I think it's a possible thing, but it's not <em>likely</em> outside of the context of a battle or a pretty specific event.

Remember when I said that PCs are good at every ability? That's the key part. Sure, an NPC can initiate a contest, and thus determine which ability is used. But the PCs are good at everything! So it's no big deal. Because you don't ever have a situation where an ability is needed in a contest and you can't participate because you didn't spend any points on it. You can always roll at least a d4 + d6 or better (your name) and you have lots of resources to get even better dice, for any contest in the game.<br/><br/>Also, note that an NPC initiating a contest is not the same as the GM mandating the terms of an objective from a privileged position.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D. Jacobson</cite>I think it is overstating things to say that every ability is equally relevant in actual play and that the Antagonist has no role in determining which abilities are relevant in any given session.</blockquote>\nI'm not saying that. I'm saying that the GM may not employ blocking like "that won't work here." No single person determines which abilities are relevant in play because they all are, as I hope I've been able to show.
