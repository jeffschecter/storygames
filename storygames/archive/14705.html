Do you want a brand new game, RIGHT NOW?!? <br/><br/>I am incredibly happy to announce the release of my new game Pickets &amp; Blinds: Telling Stories of Murder in the American Townscape. <br/><br/>Available in print for $16 from <a href="http://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/213010" rel="nofollow">Magcloud.com</a><br/>or as a PDF starting at $12 (see promotions below) from <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=17752&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">IndiePressRevolution.com</a><br/><br/><b>About the game</b><br/>Pickets &amp; Blinds is a competitive storytelling game where each player tells their own story about regular suburban American citizens who is driven to commit murder. It's a dark, sometimes funny, often poignant look at average folks who get involved with extreme circumstances. Everyone starts out with their stories existing separately but by the end of the game peoples actions have influenced each other and the stories find ways to knit together. This all happens completely organically, and behind the curtain (it's like pulp fiction or independence day, lots of unrelated characters affecting each other). FACTS:<br/><br/>\u2022 Games take about 2-3 hours<br/>\u2022 No GM<br/>\u2022 3-6 players (works with 7, but everyone gets less spotlight time, and your stories are more hurried)<br/>\u2022 Simple, playing card based mechanic (it's pretty much "memory")<br/>\u2022 Over 500 unique and flavorful story "leads" (nuggets of color that you drop into your scenes)<br/>\u2022 50 page, perfect bound, full color glossy magazine (print version)<br/>\u2022 26 page, bookmarked and linked, screen ready PDF<br/><br/><b>Promotions</b><br/>1. So the PDF version of the game is starting out at the retail price of $12. Buuuuut I don't really want to charge that, what I really want is twitter followers. So, for every 25 followers I accrue (over 300) i'll drop the price of the PDF $1. That means that if/when i get to 600 followers the PDF becomes free to the public. That twitter, by the way: <a href="/forums/profile/kevinallenjr">@kevinallenjr</a><br/><br/>2. There are two direct song lyric quotes in the text of Pickets &amp; Blinds. First person to find both of them (just send me an email, DM me, whisper in this thread, etc) gets a copy of Sweet Agatha and a bonus list of story leads for Pickets &amp; Blinds that no one else has. <br/><br/>I've been working on this project for a while and I'm really very excited to see it finally out in the world. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I do. If you have any questions about the game or the promotions or any of that, feel free to ask away in this thread.<br/><br/>Also, check out <a href="http://www.picketsandblinds.com" rel="nofollow">www.picketsandblinds.com</a> for even more info and a peek under the cover.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334189/#Comment_334189" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T07:56:42+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  7:56AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2011 8:14AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played this at Dreamation and it is wonderful.

I haven't ever been very satisfied with print on demand services, I tend to make smaller games, and I feel like physically very few indie games stand out from each other (in that all the books are sort of the same size/format). Magcloud was an interesting answer to this (the recent addition of perfect binding sealed the deal). The issue is that as your game gets longer the less reasonable magcloud's costs become. At 20\xa2 a page you can approach the unprofitable sales point pretty quickly. On the other hand the printing is superb, the magazines are solid, nicely glossy, the color is spot on what you send them, issues are printed and sent to you very fast, free proof, and the user interface is super easy. It's not for everybody or every product, but if it works for you it's really tight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334219/#Comment_334219" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T10:34:56+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 10:34AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've ordered this!

It arrived in my mailbox in Minnesota yesterday.  Fast!<br/><br/>I haven't started reading yet, but I can report on the book.  It's very nice quality.  <br/><br/>In transit, the top of the spine got banged up just a little, but I've honestly bought books from retail that were worse.  There's also a dent in the cover that I assume came in the post.  It's nit-picky of me, but I'm trying for completeness.<br/><br/>When the book is laying face-up, the cover curls open a bit but it's just about as hot and humid as it ever gets in Minnesota, so that might be the culprit even though it's been in the AC for fifteen hours now.  (It doesn't curl open when placed face-down, so it might not be humidity.)  <br/><br/>The grey page-background color prints notably different on the cover and interior stocks.  This is barely perceptible at the front cover and quite obvious at the back.  Kevin, is it like that in the copies you saw?  If you cared to do something about it, how hard would it be to compensate for?<br/><br/>Overall, I'm excited about MagCloud and hope to see more stuff coming from them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335193/#Comment_335193" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T08:54:25+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  8:54AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, <br/><br/>Glad you got you copy so fast.
