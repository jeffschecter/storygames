It's safe to say I have a serious love/hate thing going on with these books.  It has a lot of elements I really like and a lot of elements I really don't.  In my opinion John Wick's No Loyal Knight tackles a similar idea MUCH MUCH better.<br/><br/>However, one of the elements I really like are all the scenes that basically read like Sorcerer source fiction.  If you want to know how to run demons in Sorcerer read all the scenes involving "demon like" entities in these books.  The scenes with Bob are textbook.  Jim Butcher can write demons and it makes me want to play Sorcerer with him as the GM.<br/><br/>So, I started thinking about how I could play Dresden Files with Sorcerer (apologies to Fred and Co for all their hard work on their Fate driven version).  The natural complaint is that there's a lot of non-demon fueled magic in the books.  Yes, there is.  Here's the rules mod I'd tack on to make it work.<br/><br/>A character can duplicate the effects of Demon Ability without a Demon by doing the following:<br/><br/>1) Roll Will vs. Humanity.  If this roll is successful the ability works substituting the character's Lore for Power as necessary.<br/><br/>2) Doing this incurs a Humanity Check rolling Lore vs. Humanity (similar to rolling Humanity against a Demon's Power for rituals).  If the roll fails, in addition to the Humanity loss the character takes damage measuring victories on the Fists table.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd ever actually play this, but it was an idea and I thought I'd share.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
