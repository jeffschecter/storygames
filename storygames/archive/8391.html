I am a bad GM. No, really. I've been going back over my BW AP recordings, and I've noticed that...<br/><br/>1: I don't really frame scenes very well at all.<br/>2: Scenes are long, meandering affairs with no real focus.<br/><br/>Now, I know the two are inter-related and off the back of re-reading PTA and reading <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6377&amp;page=1#Item_8" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> I've been having a good think about how to effectively scene-frame within Burning Wheel and other Story Games.<br/><br/>The thread linked to above focuses on the usual BW themes of hitting BITs, but also discusses the role of GM and player roles in scene framing. In my opinion, there is a shared responsibility between both GM and players to push for the scenes that players and GMs want as BW (amongst many story games) is one of those games where players <i>have</i> to be proactive in order for the game to zing.<br/><br/>From the players perspective their Beliefs provide a goal for the player to strive towards while the GM has an overarching story arc as a motivator for action. While Instincts and traits can provide motivation for scenes, I would argue that they are secondary to beliefs as beliefs are the player's priorities for action.<br/><br/>The GM needs to push forward the story while the players priority encompasses both driving forward the story as well as developing the character. With that in mind (and reading MouseGuard), I'd like to throw the following out there as a way of seeing how others go about framing their scenes and/or whether I am talking a big pile of doggy doo.<br/><br/><b>Beliefs</b><br/>1: An Overarching Belief which tells the audience and guides the player toward how the character will behave in reaction to a certain circumstance and decision point.<br/>2: A Personal Goal that is a player priority for something he wishes the character to achieve. It can be a short term or long-term goal, but it must be achievable.<br/>3: A Plot Goal that ties the character into the situation at hand. It must be intimately associated with the overarching plot or arc of the game and must be achievable.<br/><br/><b>Scene Framing</b><br/>1: The player decides if he wants a Personal or a Plot scene which will serve to advance the goal of either the player or the group as a whole. The scene must tie into one of the character\u2019s beliefs.<br/>1A: Should no player have a scene in mind, then the GM steps up with a plot scene that will hit both the story development and hit one or more of the character's beliefs.<br/>2: In PTA parlance, a scene will either provide insight into the character or provide information that will move the story along.<br/>3: The Focus of the scene will be either to develop the character or advance the plot.<br/>4: The Agenda tells everyone what the player would like to see happen in the scene. Not the nuts and bolts of each action, rather the player\u2019s intent for that scene and the likely conflict which may occur.<br/>5: The Location is simply that. Where does the scene take place and who is present.<br/>6: The GM will then take this information and frame the scene for that player. Once framed, the scene is handed over to the player to resolve.<br/><br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185475/#Comment_185475" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T10:31:22+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 10:31AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little confused.

Your summary of Scene Framing is pretty much Primetime Adventure's procedures of play but you have some Burning Wheel lingo mixed in.<br/><br/>Are you mixing on purpose?

You don't have to go into grueling detail, but I need an example.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185577/#Comment_185577" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T09:58:17+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  9:58AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi guys and thanks for the responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been trying to post coherent responses to all of these, however my head seems to be filled with cotton wool today for some reason (nothing to do with drinking and dancing till stupid-o'clock, I'm sure).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've deleted and modified this post so many times I'm seeing double.

With BW, this seems easy to do: poke them in the eye with their Beliefs, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about other games?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you set up a good scene? What's there? What's important? How does it get determined?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me think up some stuff I've done:<br/>\n<br/>\nDelta Green: each scene is anticipating the text of of the adventure I was running. Each piece was introduced to show a certain person, personality, clue, event, that would build on what was going to happen. Very little reaction framing (reacting to what they players had already done) because I had a terrifying plot to get on with, dammit!<br/>\n<br/>\nDnd: each scene is set up to intro the basics: here's the watering hole, here's the place to buy gear, here's the adventure hook, here's the ambush on the way to dungeon, here's the entrance, here's the first room, here's the next, etc....here's the wrap-up. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpirit: each scene was pulled together loosely in advance with an eye toward the Aspect: with plenty of wiggle room if the player goes off the chart<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: oops, found a better thread about this stuff elsewhere on storygames.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
