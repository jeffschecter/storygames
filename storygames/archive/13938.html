The first game is called Dying Memories and it's about people slowly trying to piece their existence back together in the final fractured moments of their lives. It has a science fiction edge, but in much the same way that Quantum Leap was science fiction. It plays upon certain conventions like character creation and character knowledge and twists those around on the players. I've been trying to get a group together to play locally, but anyone who knows the LA scene knows, gaming is gasping for air here.<br/><br/>Anyway. I'd be glad to send a PDF to anyone interested in trying out my game.<br/><br/>I appreciate it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brenton" title="Brenton"><img alt="Brenton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brenton">Brenton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315850/#Comment_315850" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T07:11:40+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  7:11AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking for one-shot or long-term play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
