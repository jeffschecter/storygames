Great thoughts below. He covers what didn't click about 4E with older fans and how to get back to the essence of D&amp;D.; He also mentions the difference between narrative games and more traditional games like the original D&amp;D; being more of a simulation.  I don't think 4E is a narrative game at all (it's more of a tactics first kind of game in my opinion) but I do agree that many old school D&amp;D; players I've gamed with want more of a simulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately I don't think 4E being less of a simulation was the only reason it didn't meet expectations (although it's easiest to address now). There was a series of obstacles (none having to do with Mearls) from 3E being such a large success (D&amp;D; was competing with itself), canceling Dungeons &amp; Dragons magazines, claiming 4E wasn't coming out soon then announcing it was coming out, mocking aspects of 3E in the 4E announcement at Gencon (while 3E was much loved), OGL being replaced by the GSL and essentially killing third party support, Paizo who ran Dungons &amp; Dragons magazines continuing to support 3E and many third party companies sticking with Paizo, game stores excited about Paizo sticking with 3E so they can continue to sell their 3E back stock, a more "badass" art style that was neither old school nor new feeling, the Online Campaign tools advertised in all the 4E core books never coming out, yearly versions of the core books (PHB 1, 2, 3, MM 1, 2, 3, DMG 1, 2), Wizards stopped selling PDFs, the Digital Insider service made it so that you didn't have to buy all the 4E books, feeding into the old fan base's fear that D&amp;D; was becoming a mini or card game by requiring the use of minis and selling power cards, constant rules changes &amp; errata, and I'm sure a lot more I'm forgetting. It's been a very bumpy ride. Not to mention modern day concerns that are affecting all of publishing from competitions from digital games, piracy, retailers closing down, and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, the Essentials Red Box is what I wanted D&amp;D; 4E to be when it first came out. There is a lot I think 4E did better than previous editions and I'm glad they aren't abandoning ship. And I'm excited they are taking risks and moving forward. The Castle Ravenloft boardgame is amazing and Gamma World sounds promising.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">everyone from your CEO to your fanbase is clamoring for you to find a strategy to win the fight. And then you realize that the most recent edition of D&amp;D;, in its attempt to find a winning strategy, was accused of betraying the very D&amp;D;  legacy it sought to uphold.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">"Look, no one at Wizards ever woke up one day and said 'Let's get rid of all of our fans and replace them.' That was never the intent," Mearls said. "With 4th Edition, there were good intentions. We are D&amp;D; fans. We want D&amp;D; to be the best roleplaying game it can be. We're always open to change, to reacting to what people say."</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The Red Box is all about saying 'you buy this box, you take it home, you unwrap it, and you're playing within two minutes.' You're not reading through 50 pages of combat rules, trying to figure out how it works. There's an immediate entry point."<br/>\n<br/>\n"At this point, if you're just getting into it, Essentials is the better bet, even just for the price point," Mearls said. "One of the things we're doing, since it's a smaller format, is a 6x9 soft-cover book. I just got my copy of Heroes of the Fallen Lands. It retails for $20, it has levels 1-30 of the classic four classes: Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric."</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">"If you look at the Fighter and the way he works in D&amp;D;  Essentials, we removed the Daily powers to get more of a sense that 'fighters and wizards should look really different,' because that's how D&amp;D; originally approached it," Mearls said. "I remember playing the Wizard way back in Basic D&amp;D;, where you had one spell and you had four hit points, if you were lucky, and you needed the Fighter to protect you. That's a much different playing experience than when you are playing the Fighter, where you're in the front line, you're taking all the risks, you're charging into combat. The game you played was different. The way I like to design things - especially in RPGs - is all about that feeling, that when you approach the game, you're approaching it the way your character would. You're thinking like a Fighter; you're thinking like a Wizard."<br/>\n<br/>\nThese sentiments were all the more noteworthy when contrasted with the stated design philosophy of another of Mearls' predecessors, Rob Heinsoo, who had explicitly praised the sameness of all of 4th Edition's classes: "The point of bringing in powers for every character class was to make the game fun for everyone most of the time." Heinsoo had also gone out of his way to slam design efforts built around simulating a fantasy world, saying that it "might make sense if you're simulating a specific type of fantasy world ... but it doesn't make any sense for new players who want to have fun."</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Justin Alexander elegantly expresses many players' problems with 4E in an essay titled "Dissociated Mechanics." Alexander damned the powers mechanics and marking system in 4E because they were not simulating anything that happened in the game world. For example, why could a Rogue only pull off his fancy Daily power once per day? The only answer was because those were the rules of the game, not because that was how combat ought or should work in the fantasy setting. We asked Mearls if he or anyone else at Wizards had read Alexander's essay or even considered how 4E was fundamentally disassociated from the world it ostensibly simulated.<br/>\n<br/>\n"It's funny you brought that up because I'd read that blog entry. It's definitely something I've thought of," Mearls said. "If you're an experienced player and if you're willing to give some allowances to how the game works versus how you think reality should work, you're probably in a narrative mode. If you're more into the narrative side of gaming, you're used to taking mechanics and interpreting them to say 'this is what just happened.'"<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Mearls doesn't believe that most D&amp;D;  players want to play that way. "I almost think narrative games are a different hobby, where it really is group world building or literal group storytelling. In a more traditional roleplaying game like D&amp;D;, you build it as you go and it's almost like a game of football or some sport where the action arises as you go."</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">"If you are a disgruntled D&amp;D; fan, there's nothing I can say to you that undoes whatever happened two years ago or a year ago that made you disgruntled - but what I can do, what's within my power, is that going forward, I can make products, I can design game material, I can listen to what you're saying, and I can do what I can do with design to make you happy again; to get back to that core of what makes D&amp;D;, D&amp;D; to what made people fall in love with it the first time, whether it was the Red Box in '83, the original three booklets back in '74 or '75 or even 3rd Edition in 2004, whenever that happened, to get back to what drew you into D&amp;D; in the first place and give that back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n"If you're unhappy with 4th Edition, I say take a look at Essentials and see where we're moving."</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nReaction: <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/printthread.php?t=536962&amp;pp=200" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/printthread.php?t=536962&amp;pp;=200</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293613/#Comment_293613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T10:51:30+00:00" title="September 16, 2010 10:51AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2010 10:52AM by Tavis.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things I think is important to say about this was from the things to watch thread where someone says that pure Q&amp;A; interviews are a cover-your-ass response to libel suits in the '70s. Good journalism should present the background, and the facts of the situation - as presented in your summary above, or in the article - make it hard to tell a hit job from snapshots of a trainwreck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also note that, by pitching hardballs, Macris gives Mearls a chance to hit them out of the park in a convincing way. A hit job wouldn't give him as many quotes where he looks real good. By the end of the piece I was rooting for Mike because it showed that he had thought about the difficult issues, could talk about them openly, and wasn't afraid to acknowlege criticism. I think I'm not alone in finding that this interview made me feel a lot better about the direction of 4E than all the more-sympathetic press where I was supposed to believe my issues with 4E were because I didn't like fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293620/#Comment_293620" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T11:26:35+00:00" title="September 16, 2010 11:26AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found the linking to the Enworld Thread amusing.

There was somehow a lot of charm to AD&amp;D which remains my favourite edition. Some of that is obviously nostalgia and no new edition is ever going to replace that but a lot of it was to do with the sheer amount of rules. Sure they were printed on all the little card things but it seemed to me to heading in a CRPG direction. Even on 3e a friend had held up the book  and said, "Look the manual to the computer game" whilst pointing at the disk. Although I've still not played WoW or equivalent, I'm not opposed to it, that would be daft, but importing CRPG terminology like the character roles which, to me, pointed even more at combat was a step away from what I wanted to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293670/#Comment_293670" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T16:51:29+00:00" title="September 16, 2010  4:51PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like 4e.

The only answer was because those were the rules of the game, not because that was how combat ought or should work in the fantasy setting. </br></blockquote>\nOkay, this bit is a little nonsensical to me - - monsters have had powers they can use X times per Y for twenty years or more. My old AD&amp;D Monster Manual told me that Baa'tezu could summon other demons(devils?) x times per week. And I think dryads or something had a charm power that could only be used 1/day, or whatever.<br><br/>What's the simulation-only, not-just-rules justification for that, eh? D&amp;D's design goal has never been pure simulation; even from a perspective not informed by some kind of RPG theory, it makes intuitive sense that, as a basic design theme, one could keep insisting "Tell me why this makes <i>sense</i>!" As such, the number of times a dragon can use its breath weapon would either be based on some fantasy-world reasoning (and if so, why *not* as often as it likes?) OR beginning with such reasoning, and then being tweaked for the sake of fairness or correcting the amount of challenge desired. <br/><br/><i>Tunnels and Trolls</i> actually handles this really well: they have a slew of rather tongue-in-cheek "realism" explanations for things that seem to be clearly based on maintaining a consistent economy of resources. F'rex, spellcasters have to pay money between adventures to learn new spells. To me, this is clearly a money sink, but it's nonetheless justified in the text by mentioning a Guild of Wizards or some such, for our amusement. It also fills in the world a bit more, and I think that by playing at making a very "obvious" attempt to justify rules with in-game material, it actually comes across as charming and immersive in its silliness.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293709/#Comment_293709" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T01:41:08+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  1:41AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>I really like most of what essentials was doing, except that they're backepedaling on the "everyone gets powers" design.

Occasionally you might have to carefully drop an area-effect spell into a crowd.  In order to play a thief you'll have to maneuver a bit and understand combat advantage.  In order to play a cleric you need to remember to ask who's low on hit points.and look for chances to drop handy plusses into handy situations.<br/><br/>In order to play a 1st level 4E fighter, you have to be intimately acquainted with the two kinds of attacks you can take out of turn -- your reaction attack and your opportunity attack.  One you get once per round, another you get once per turn.  One works only on moves, the other works on shifts.  One gets your Wisdom bonus. One works only with a mark.  One of them stops movement.

No marking or any of that other stuff, so much streamlined.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Essentials is a big step forward and the rules compendium is a sweetly laid out little reference book, one of the regular D&amp;D; DMs who was a player in this session to fill out a table had been reluctant to get it as "unnecessary" but he referred to it 4 times during the game and found the rule he was looking for almost immediate 3 out 4 times (having never cracked that book before), and the 1 time he couldn't find it it was because it was a rule that had changed (something to do with criticaling saving throws).  So clearly a nice pick up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me the remaining D&amp;D; weaknesses are these.  This is what I was hoping would have been addressed better:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) its still d20 whiff tastic.  Turns take long enough that when you finally get to take one and you accomplish...nothing...its rather anti climactic.<br/>\n2) The boss monsters have so many HPs that they're still alive and kicking long after fighting them has ceased to be interesting and has become a largely mathematical atritian exercise in DoT calculations.  Tactical?  Sure.  Exciting?  Not so much.  Heroic?  Definitely not if your definition of heroic combat involves chopping through enemies in great rapidity.<br/>\n3) The damage rolls add to the whifftasticity of the game.  I managed to roll a 19 and hit...awesome...my d12 damage does...1 point...crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were the lead D&amp;D; designer, here's what I would have thought about.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Why be stingy with the action points?  Combos are cool...witness any video fighting game...they MAKE the game.  Lets use APs as a kick ass combo engine rather than dishing them out in dribs and drabs.  Extra actions make you feel cool and put down bad guys faster making the combats quicker in real time and more heroic feeling at the same time.  So how would I do this?  How about this.  Earn 1 Action Point every time you fail a d20 roll.  That way you never actually "miss" you just defer that particular hit to a later time period.  Then, for simplicity, APs reset back to one after every encounter.  Or, slightly more gameriffic, you can save a number of APs from one encounter to the next equal to the number of Healing Surges you've USED.  Kind of the Bruce Willis die hard gaining momentum from getting beat on effect.  Taking those extended rests then has real meaty consequences.  I might do a triangular progression to spend more than 1 AP in a single round just to keep things a little contained, but that might be my own "oh noes...too much fun is happening" version of making them scarce to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I'd tie damage roll minimums to the amount you hit by...if you needed a 16 and rolled a 23 than your damage die roll can't be less than 7.  That's one I used back in my old 1E days and it worked outstandingly.  The math might be annoying for some, so perhaps theres a better way of getting the same type of effect...like rolling multiple damage dice and keeping the highest if you beat the to-hit by at least 4 or something.  Basically if your schtick is to do massive damage on bad guys than following a fantastic to-hit roll with a lousy damage roll is just depressing.  I'd probably also expand what APs can be spent on so you can spend an AP for another raw damage die as a built in "power up" counter strike.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Make 20s do something cool...making them do max damage is yawn worthy.  How about class feats that are tied to what happens on a 20.  On a 20 the striker does double damage.  On a 20 a slayer type fighter can immediately make a 2nd attack.  On a 20 a defensive type fighter gets a +10 bonus to his AC until his next turn.  On a 20 a rogue type character can immediately shift up their dex bonus.  I don't know...something that says 20s are cool again.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Streamline things.  Why does the game need both Action Points AND a Second Wind check box?  (and why the hell does the second wind reset every encounter and the Action Point every 2...that's just tedius cruft).  Ditch Second Wind as a seperate thing and simply make it one of the things you can do with an Action Point.  Or if that's too much, make it cost ALL of your Action Points to do it.  Lots of different possibilities that keep the idea but lose the extra steps.  There's a bunch of little niggling things like that...like having combat advantage gives you a +2 to hit...but Charging gives you a +1.  Why?  Why make me remember that.  Why not just make all minor bonuses +2 and all bigger bonuses +4...why make me keep track of what's what and have to look that shit up.  Pain in the ass.  I can't remember all the things like that, but there are a bunch of them (less, I think then there was under 3E).  If I were lead designer of the game there would be no rules at all that couldn't be found on your character sheet, on your power cards, or on a one page reference of Effects.  For instance...why not put the rules for movement (move 1 square in any direction difficult terrain costs double, moving while adjacent to an enemy provokes an opportunity attack (basic attack).  As the text for the "Move Action" on the character sheet or on a "move action" card.  Similarly for shift.  Similarly for Charge and Bull Rush.  Why would wizards even have charge or agility based rogues have bull rush?  Just make those moves class or feat specific, put them on cards (or in the power section of the sheet) make them at will powers and eliminate the need for looking that shit up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO playtesting for Essentials should have worked like this.  Observe newbies play.  Make note of every time they stop and reference the rules over the course of several sessions.  Make a list of everything they had to look up.  Rework that rule so it makes sense to include it on a character sheet, on a power card, or on the DMs screen.  If you can't...scrap it.  When you run out of room on the character sheet or the DMs screen...stream line, combine, prioritze, then scrap the rest.  D&amp;D; Essentials SHOULD have meant...never looking up something in a rule book during play again...at least not beyond clarifying an interpretation that is then easy to remember for next time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the tactical feel of 4E.  I like it way better than the roll to hit roll to hit roll to hit roll to hit repetition of 1 and 2E and way way way better than the infinite minutia of 3E once you have 15,000 feats firing off from 300 different books all trying to interact with each other in ill defined ways.  I like that they took a page out of CCGs and use key words to specify exactly what an effect does and then the powers just call on those key words rather than having a dozen different variations on what it means to daze somebody.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don't like the fact that combat still comes down to attrition.  I want combat to be a build up to a climactic death blow, and for it to take about 1/3 to 1/2 as long as it does.  2+ hours to fight the climactic battle in the game day scenario is FAR too long, even for a climactic battle.  Once you've blown your AP and your Encounter Powers...it just becomes a slog.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293749/#Comment_293749" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T08:47:57+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  8:47AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, Valamir.

My old school D&amp;D crew also didn't like it, though I can't speak as well to why they didn't.<br><br>Anyway, later on, while listening to Clyde interview Vincent about the "arrows and clouds" stuff, it hit me. It also hit me when the interview with Mearls started to talk about "disassociated mechanics."<br><br>I believe that Mearl's response that this is just two different types of gaming is hand-waving away the problem a bit. (And, I know Mearls personally and really like the guy, so it's not meant as an attack.)<br><br>My impression is that the D&amp;D powers just don't do a <i>good enough</i> job of bringing real world elements (stuff on cards, minis, dice, etc.) back into the shared imagination of what's going on. That's what people mean when they say "It's just a board game now." And, I think they're right, alas.<br><br>What is the fictional consequence of me using my Rogue's 1/day awesome ability? It's not fictionally magical, is it? I mean, there's no spiritual "exhaustion" or whatever after which my rogue can no longer do that really, really cool thing, which would explain why he can only do it once per day. It's just game stuff. <br><br>That's fine as far as it goes, but it's just one example of how -- for me and apparently many others -- 4E doesn't do a very good job being a role-playing game. And, I define a role-playing game as an activity or game where what the people do affects what goes on in their shared imagination. There are just so many things in the game that a player can competently do in the real world (roll dice, mark some things down on paper, move minis around) that are effectively <i>irrelevant</i> to what's going on in other players' imagination. <br><br>I see this a major failing, not of the kind Mearls describes. It's not like some players like "simulation" and other players like narrative. It's that nearly all of those players desire some kind of shared imagining going on. They don't all require "great story" or whatever. But, I believe that nearly all RPGers do the activity because they want to imagine things together in a way that board games and CCGs can't.<br><br>When I play and observe 4E, I don't see the game doing <i>enough</i> to help us imagine things together. Oh, it happens. But, it's as though it happens <i>in spite</i> of (most of) the game's support.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293756/#Comment_293756" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T09:22:46+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  9:22AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>That's fine as far as it goes, but it's just one example of how -- for me and apparently many others -- 4E doesn't do a very good job being a role-playing game.

If they can't do so, they can't use the powers. Just like trait use in Dogs in the Vineyards, for example. So when the bard uses some weird emotional-influence power on a barely sentient giant ant, he has to describe how it seems to work or he can't do it. I stop players and make them describe the effects. Sometimes they stretch too far and when the other players and I are squinting or making faces, I know it isn't working. The player can get creative and narrate something that works or they can use another power. This results in the fighter describing his marking as grabbing onto the hive drone's leg and yanking him back toward him, for example. <br><br>I'm not saying that you and The Escapist don't have a point. The 4E rules make this kind of shared space harder to achieve--I grant that. But with a little bit of effort, you can have it back, along with all the goodies that 4E offers.<br><br/>I've never had a problem with the idea of daily powers. I always think of it this way: the character probably could do it more than once a day, but it just wouldn't succeed. Not because that's how it works, but because such things are difficult and cosmic forces align and all. I liken it to how magic seems to work in fantasy novels. You don't see the wizard casting the same effective spell over and over. Just when it moves the story forward. D&amp;D daily powers are sorta like that. And again, I grant that it takes some shoehorning to fit into your imagination (and suspension of disbelief).                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293771/#Comment_293771" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T10:29:00+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 10:29AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 10:30AM by Daniel H..">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage and Matt S., I\u2019m right there with you guys, too.  Here\u2019s the exchange from the unedited interview.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alexander Macris</cite><b>Mike Mearls:</b> It's funny you brought that up because I'd read that blog entry. It's definitely something we thought of because if you're an experienced player and if you're willing to give some allowances to how the game works vs. how you think reality should work, you're probably in a narrative mode. It's especially easy for experienced roleplayers. If you're more into the narrative side of gaming, you're used to taking mechanics and interpreting them to say "well this is what just happened." But I don't think that's a mode of people who haven't played RPGs before, who don't necessarily think in a narrative fashion are used to. Because it happens after the action.<br/><br/>If you're playing the game and you attack an ogre and something happens, unless your mind is attuned that way, it's really hard to go "okay, I need to stop the action, pause, something just happened and now I have to explain it after the fact." I'm not in the flow of the game of saying "I'm going to use the ability that will let me charge and attack three guys." So I run forward and I know that as I run forward and I leap in the air and swing my axe in a broad arc and attack three guys. There's much more flow there in the action of moving your figure using the miniatures, you're rolling the dice to do the attack. It matches up very nicely to what is happening in the game. You're not doing it and saying "oh, this is what happened." Because it pulls everyone out of the action.<br/><br/><b>The Escapist: I have that experience whenever I play narrative games that in a sense I almost feel like there is less of a feel of a story because I do have to get pulled out and reinterpret what just happened abstractly and explain it as compared to a game where the mechanic or interface is explaining it as it goes.</b><br/><br/><b>Mike Mearls:</b> Exactly. It's interesting because if you look at roleplaying games in general, I think you can see narrative games spring up more in what I think of as high-end users, people who have been playing for awhile or have really thought a lot about gaming, and I almost think of narrative games are almost a different hobby, where it really is group world building or literal group storytelling. Not in the sense of "this is the action that is happening and we're going to form a story as we go," but more "let's sit down and when we're done, we're going to have a narrative, we're going to have a story we built together." It's almost like at the end you look back and say "this is what we built," where in a more traditional roleplaying game like D&amp;D, you build it as you go and it's almost like a game of football or some sport where the action arises as you go.</blockquote>\nStill, I\u2019m at a bit of a loss here.  What exactly are these \u201cnarrative games\u201d they\u2019re referencing?  Do they mean Burning Wheel, or do they mean A Thousand and One Nights?  There\u2019s a big difference there.<br/><br/>Later in the article, Mr. Mearls says \u201cThe most fun I have with D&amp;D is when people are in that mode of \u2018I'm in character, I'm going to interact with this world.\u2019"  What\u2019s likeable about Dogs in the Vineyard or The Shadow of Yesterday is that the stuff that makes up my character\u2014his background, his motivations, etc.\u2014also engage the game elements (i.e. the conflict mechanics, the reward cycle, whatever).  After a couple years of playing independent and small-press games, when I saw 4th Edition on the horizon, I figured that here was the opportunity for the flagship roleplaying-game property to move in that direction, to connect those aspects of character with which people always have infused their play with the rest of the game (e.g. the conflicts or the rewards).  Other games had figured out how to make those things matter, so logically the new D&amp;D would follow suit.  Instead, 4th Edition was as divorced as ever from what always had been most engaging to me about roleplaying games: the notion of looking at the hard choices and sacrifices a character would make, because of who he is.<br/><br/>I looked at the 4th Edition rules and said \u201cNothing here supports my preferred kind of character-inhabiting experience, so I\u2019ll play this straight as a tactical wargame.\u201d  I\u2019m not looking for a storytelling exercise, so much as I am looking for facets of character through which I can interpret what\u2019s going on in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293772/#Comment_293772" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T10:43:38+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 10:43AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting that, Daniel.

I don't disagree that previous editions also had odd elements like those you describe. <br/><br/>That said, I think this edition does it in a such a widespread, systematic way that people found too little refuge for imagination. That is, sure, previous editions did this too. But this one went too far. Something like that, and all very subjective among gamers. <br/><br/>That said, I still think there are way, way more people for whom this "refuge of imagination" is more important than Mike assumes.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a><br/><br/>You lost me. Sure, your resources as a <i>player</i> become more scant and fictional tension is likely to rise. But, it doesn't satisfy what I'm pondering, really. You went on to say very reasonable things about the tension in the fiction and rescuing the princes and so on ... and then followed up with a bunch of real-world stuff like dice and people stepping up to impress (i.e. not-fiction things). But, what are those things imaginatively? D&amp;D provides no clues, or too few clues. Even with the ratcheted tension, I still don't know how to make fictional sense of what my rogue does and why it happens once per day outside of the fact we're playing a well-balanced game (or whatever other power thing). Vancian spells at least attempted to explain, for example.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam">@Adam</a><br/><br/>That is really cool. I dig it, personally. But, my read of the rules is that, well, you're really breaking the rules! Theoretically at least, you just took away a bunch of those well-balanced choices players have to whoop monster ass. And, as cool narratively as it sounds, I could see people getting frustrated. Again, all theoretically.<br/><br/>So, what I take away is, look, playing in Adam's game is <i>awesome</i>. But, that's because it's Adam's game. Not because it's D&amp;D. Now, you're all working harder to have fun, and D&amp;D could have been designed in ways to make you work less hard. (shrug)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Daniel">@Daniel</a><br/><br/>I'm nodding. <br/><br/>And, you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking, hey, Mike! Go read &amp; play Apocalypse World and understand Moves. Because, there's a way you can describe all kinds of awesome, narratively exciting things, and even then moves still apply. They're not after the fact, and they give you these awesome things your character can do. It's not D&amp;D, but Vincent showed the way it could be done, and wouldn't even have to be one of those hippie narrative deals, either.<br/><br/>And, yes, I also agree. Generally speaking, I understand Mike's point about different kinds of gamers. But, I think the dichotomy he ends up making is completely bogus. It's not as though those high-end weirdo narrative games over there can't also "build it as you go and it's almost like a game [snip] where the action arises as you go." See also: Sorcerer. Dogs.

It builds an environment that encourages the players to think of the scene from their character's point of view and act appropriately. It adds enough detail to get things started, and relies on the players choices, rather than the mechanics of skill checks or powers, to drive the action.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe reference to monsters is relevant because they introduce the most abstract parts of the game. Combat and magic are things we don't really have daily experience with, so we accept that the dice are going to tell us how it turns out. Navigating in space we do have daily experience with, so we don't use dice to tell us if we make it out of the dungeon. We want to make a map, just like our characters do, and decide which turns to take, just like they do. We accept dissocated mechanics for combat because it's hard to simulate otherwise. Part of what Mike is talking about here, I think, is that the less fighting you do, the more your choices are about the fiction and not  manipulating game elements.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd argue that what this post implies goes beyond what Daniel says above: "4th Edition was as divorced as ever from what always had been most engaging to me about roleplaying games: the notion of looking at the hard choices and sacrifices a character would make, because of who he is."<br/>\n<br/>\nPrevious versions of D&amp;D; at least let you make choices based on the most basic definition of who your guy is: what he experiences with his own senses. Building your adventure with OD&amp;D; encourages you to make things concrete: your character can see this lever, and that portcullis. You can then clothe those details in 4E mechanics, whereas if you start with the skill challenge layer it can be hard to figure out exactly what's going on in the fiction: you're making choices based on who you are and what you know about the number of accumulated successes and failures, not what your character experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, just looking at the combat, 4E's healing surges are substantially more dissociated than OD&amp;D;'s dead henchmen; as I've <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/henchmen-are-the-opposite-of-dissociated-mechanics/" rel="nofollow">argued elsewhere</a> this is a case of the 4E rules interposing between you and the things it's possible to care about in the fiction. Apocalypse World is exciting to me because it seems to achieve storyness not by making the things my character cares about impact the mechanics directly, but rather by fostering situations so that the choices my character makes are about concrete things in the world I can care about, like dead henchmen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293790/#Comment_293790" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T12:25:02+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 12:25PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roleplaying has to matter (for me and in my opinion, I'm not making absolute statements).<br><br>Many 4E games were broken down into predetermined encounters. One of the reasons Skill Challenges didn't work is because their results barely mattered. The books encourage you not to let failure in a Skill Challenge stop the game but at the same time don't let victory circumvent prepared encounters. So either way, why bother?<br><br>Making encounters in 4E is hard. There are so many moving parts that the encounter creation rules don't give you a good sense of how difficult an encounter will actually be. An encounter equal to your level  could be insanely difficult and an encounter higher than your level could be ridiculously easy.  Part of the problem was your encounter XP budget doesn't take into account terrain which is a huge factor. There is so much tweaking needed to hit the right encounter balance, it's difficult to improvise. And when you create the right encounter, you don't want to skip it. <br><br>With less improvisation, you have more railroading. Why does failing a Skill Challenge even have the potential to stop an adventure? Is there only 1 path? <br><br>Even if roleplaying mattered. The entire encounter format in my opinion was problematic. At an hour or so per encounter and with the way hit points, milestones, and daily powers worked... to make the system sing it often meant aiming for 3 linked encounters a session. Which left no room for roleplaying (yes you can roleplay when you swing your sword but even if you are ok with it not mattering there still isn't much time to do it). <br/><br/>And I don't think DMG, page 42 makes up for this. The basic numbers guiding page 42 have changed 4 times, it contradicts rather than smoothly fits into the rest of the game, and the majority of game material ignores it. It's a great concept! But it wasn't enough to convince most people. <br/><br/>Castle Ravenloft is a pretty amazing game. It's actually more of what I want parts of 4E to be like. It actually went a different direction than Essentials. It took Encounter powers away, not daily powers. The whole concept of encounters is gone which I much prefer. <br/><br/>Daily powers is actually more descriptive than prescriptive. When I take an extended rest, it is 100% driven by the fiction and descriptive, I get my daily powers back. Encounters powers technically come back after a 5 minute rest but in play it often just becomes, "you're done with challenge 1, time for challenge 2", which is more prescriptive. <br/><br/>Ultimately it didn't feel like the fiction mattered.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293795/#Comment_293795" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T12:57:04+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 12:57PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even though I prefer 4E over Pathfinder, I'm friends with a lot of people who work for Paizo, help with organized play, freelance and playtest for them. I got to witness up close everyone's reactions to 4E and the simple reasons why it didn't click for them.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> reason... you have to use maps and minis. <br/><br/>I like maps and minis. But a lot of people don't. In general I've found many of my pathfinder friend's tastes very conservative. That's not a bad thing.  They like what they like out of game. It's fun, it's not supposed to be work and once they find something that is comfortable they don't want too much change to risk ruining it. They were already paranoid and upset over the changes from 3E to 3.5E (and many of their 3E books were made useless). And when they were told that 4E wasn't coming out in a year and it did anyway, they were pissed! <br/><br/>Then the 4E announcements were coupled with mockery over aspects of 3E, their print magazines were canceled, the RPGA was forced to abandon their existing games (this led to a lot of Pathfinder converts), third party support was killed with the transition from the OGL to GSL (more people over to Paizo), 4E stylistically didn't click with the old fan base with badass Dragonborn player characters with spikes everywhere, subscription models, trying to be more like World of Warcraft (which made older gamers feel pushed out), constant errata, even more supplements to buy including multiple versions of the core books, power cards (oh no, it's turning into magic), no more PDFs, suing pirates, publishing rules advice online that used to be free but not you have to subscribe to see, threatening fan sites to close down, and on and on.  <br/><br/>But with all that, I think the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> reason was the game became more prescriptive. <br/><br/>They claimed to streamline grapple but instead was replaced by a gutted version where you could only hold on to and move someone. Want to choke them? That's a higher level power that only certain classes can get! But I'm holding the guy... why can't I just put him in a sleeper hold and make him pass out! Sorry. I can't tell you how many Paizo fans were freaking out about elements like this. Wait... I start out as a warlord but I can't afford a warhorse? A lot people might say, "who cares?", but easily 20,000+ people and counting cared. <br/><br/>I think the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> reason was no online campaign tools. <br/><br/>When you're making a new product, you have to answer... what problem are you solving? It can't be... if we make a new edition, we'll make more money! That's not the customer's problem! Your customers don't care about that nor should they. Sometimes companies try to create problems to then solve. And that just pissed people off! What problems does a new edition fix? A lot of people didn't like the changes to 4E but so many people used to play D&amp;D in college and then their friends moved away. Awesome... give them a tool they can use to keep playing with their friends! Many people even accepted the 4E changes they didn't like and labeled them as sacrifices needed to play online (I don't like minis but it will help online campaign play work). So people bought the core books which had big ads in the back for the online campaign tools but then they never came. For many of these people, the major problem 4E fixed for them never happened so they went back to 3E. And a lot of the old school players never even switched to 3E let alone 4, so they were happy with what they had. <br/><br/>I 100% agree that there are aspects of the 4E rules that scared people away but I think there is an even bigger picture at play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293800/#Comment_293800" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T13:11:04+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  1:11PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 1:12PM by Daniel H..">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tavis, you're reminding me of <a href="http://www.montecook.com/cgi-bin/page.cgi?designdiary_mmearls_8" rel="nofollow">an old post</a> of Mr. Mearls's from his Malhavoc Press days.  He wrote a supplement for the Arcana Evolved line called Ruins of Intrigue.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Mearls</cite> I decided I would design a location, one large enough for an entire campaign, and embed within it multiple possibilities for adventure. The surface elements -- the geography of the area, the inhabitants' names and appearance, the basic conflicts -- would remain the same regardless of how you used the book. The key was that all the details were mutable. A villain in one DM's campaign could be a heroic ally in another. In many ways, Ruins of Intrigue sets the stage, provides actors, gives you plenty of scenery, and suggests a few basic scripts, but lets you design your own unique campaign with a minimum of work. Rather than tell you the story about to unfold, Ruins of Intrigue offers up all the elements within a variety of potential stories, but leaves you to decide on the exact plot. Rather than dictate, it suggests possibilities.</blockquote>\nAt the time (it was 2005), this resonated with me because I was like, \u201cFinally, someone high-up in the world of roleplaying games gets that it\u2019s not about the DM trying to wrestle the players and their characters through some kind of plot.\u201d  Someone advocating exploration and character choice in a sandbox environment was rather profound.<br/><br/>This outlook is consistent with Mr. Mearls\u2019s recent praise of old-school play and what he says in the Escapist interview regarding the direction in which he wants to take 4th Edition.  Exploration is an enjoyable part of roleplaying games, but it\u2019s difficult to do well.  And this brings me back to the full Escapist article, and Mr. Mearls wanting to speed up the time between starting the game and full engagement.  What gets me engaged in an RPG really fast is when my character has things like Beliefs, Keys, or Traits that I\u2019ve defined myself, are interesting to me, and that I know will be relevant to the forthcoming game.  That\u2019s one way of addressing the issue.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Thanks for posting that, Daniel. I wonder if his definition of "interacting with the world" is just different from mine/ours.</blockquote>\nIt\u2019s quite possible.  Or, to put it another way, you and I prefer different interfaces for interacting with the world than he does.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Generally speaking, I understand Mike's point about different kinds of gamers. But, I think the dichotomy he ends up making is completely bogus. It's not as though those high-end weirdo narrative games over there can't also "build it as you go and it's almost like a game [snip] where the action arises as you go." See also: Sorcerer. Dogs. AW. etc. etc.</blockquote>\nI agree.  To go back to the edited interview: \u201cBut Mearls doesn't believe that most D&amp;D players want to play that way. \u2018I almost think narrative games are a different hobby, where it really is group world building or literal group storytelling.\u2019\u201d  This makes it seem like D&amp;D players would be better served by playing something abstract and tactical, like chess, and I doubt that\u2019s what either Mr. Mearls or Mr. Macris means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293801/#Comment_293801" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T13:14:52+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  1:14PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D players love Dread (Jenga)!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293803/#Comment_293803" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T13:20:35+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  1:20PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 3:03PM by Daniel H..">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dread has an incredibly traditional GM role!

I wish I could find where, but one of the lead designers suggested that DM's should be encouraged to create Powers on the fly to represent things that the player's were doing, and that the new "balanced math" approach would make it very easy to see what would and would not be appropriate for a character of a given class or level. If you want to open up 4e A LOT, I think the better guidelines for slightly weaker than average Powers that could be done on the fly would be awesome.<br/><br/>Skill Challenges are the same, they should be read as being more dynamic.

In Basic D&amp;D, players tend to roll and say, "Does 18 hit?" and I have to make them narrate.

If they can't do so, they can't use the powers. Just like trait use in Dogs in the Vineyards, for example. So when the bard uses some weird emotional-influence power on a barely sentient giant ant, he has to describe how it seems to work or he can't do it. I stop players and make them describe the effects. Sometimes they stretch too far and when the other players and I are squinting or making faces, I know it isn't working. The player can get creative and narrate something that works or they can use another power. This results in the fighter describing his marking as grabbing onto the hive drone's leg and yanking him back toward him, for example.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that you and The Escapist don't have a point. The 4E rules make this kind of shared space harder to achieve--I grant that. But with a little bit of effort, you can have it back, along with all the goodies that 4E offers.<br/><br/>I've never had a problem with the idea of daily powers. I always think of it this way: the character probably could do it more than once a day, but it just wouldn't succeed. Not because that's how it works, but because such things are difficult and cosmic forces align and all. I liken it to how magic seems to work in fantasy novels. You don't see the wizard casting the same effective spell over and over. Just when it moves the story forward. D&amp;D daily powers are sorta like that. And again, I grant that it takes some shoehorning to fit into your imagination (and suspension of disbelief).<br/><br/>Interestingly, I prefer the exact opposite.  Please remove your fictional mumbo jumbo from my table top Final Fantasy game please.  I figure if I want to get down and dirty with the fiction there are way better games to do that with so why bother trying to force the D&amp;D square peg to fit into that round hole.  Just read me the flavor text and set up the dungeon tiles already...<br/><br/>I mean the only roleplaying I want to do in D&amp;D these days is getting my Dwarf Voice on and telling that weasely goblin to prepare to eat my axe...to the FACE!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293831/#Comment_293831" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T16:44:17+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  4:44PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>You lost me. Sure, your resources as a<i>player</i>become more scant and fictional tension is likely to rise. But, it doesn't satisfy what I'm pondering, really</blockquote>\nYou're right.  I totally accept your point about the disconnect between the fiction and the mechanics.  There's no attempt at ecology.  There's just game rules there, and the cornball per-power written-at-3AM flavor text has never been attached to by any player in my experience ever.<br/><br/>The line of thinking I want to challenge is the "D&amp;D is just a boardgame" thinking, by pointing out ways in which the D&amp;D mechanics can be used to generate fiction.  It is trivial to play D&amp;D as a "why do we kick ass?" game instead of a "how do we kick ass?" game.  Hell, there's even a flag mechanic in D&amp;D in the form of the player-defined quest.  (which should have consumed an entire early page in the PHB instead of being buried in a paragraph in the DMG, but whatcanyado.)<br/><br/>In the "why we kick ass?" game, the mechanics have a great deal to offer, because of how precisely they limit and regulate the supply of ass-kicking the party has on hand, and how they provides for this automatic escalation of tension along the adventuring day.  I don't even think this is much of a drift of vanilla slay-for-pay 4E.  It's just a strategy for quest, encounter, and skill challenge design.<br/><br/>Anyway, I recognize this isn't likely to change your mind or anything, and I hope I'm not  sounding like I'm trying to win an argument.  I just wanted to relate my experience, for what it's worth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

I never have as a player; I tried to get the DM to let me do some, or even give us some defined by him, 'cause I felt like we were leveling too slow without quest XP. It's been a long time since I was a 4E DM outside a convention one-shot; I think I remember trying to encourage them but not having players pick up on it or feeling like there was support from the system in making user-defined quests work. Given that it's !!! FREE XP !!! I find this remarkable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do see a lot of magic item wish lists, which is maybe a little more useful from a game-playing perspective than free XP but makes no sense in the fiction. It's interesting that people complain a lot about this, but they get used; while user-defined quests make sense in the fiction (at least insofar as you accept XP as one of the original abstract mechanics) but are neglected.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it because people don't want fictional mumbo jumbo running against the grain of their miniatures game, even if they also complain about that grain running contrary to roleplaying? (Maybe the people who complain are different people, who either play 4E with user-defined quests and not wish lists, or just don't play 4E?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293842/#Comment_293842" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T18:27:48+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  6:27PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like 4E but I wasn't too happy with how it deals with the fiction.

If we're gonna get all Big Model, I'm talking about the level even more basic than agenda. When I say "shared imagination" that equals "exploration."<br/><br/>So, what I'm saying is this: Yes, D&amp;D 4E is a role-playing game. It works best for people looking to step it up. But, I'm claiming that even within that agenda, even for people who want to do that kind of thing, it still has a lot of failings in my view.<br/>To make that clear: I'm not bitching that 4E isn't Simulationist or Narrativist. I'm saying that it's not even particularly good Gamist stuff because it has too many gaps in plain ol' exploration, the foundation and definition (for me) of role-playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293846/#Comment_293846" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T18:49:17+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  6:49PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Anyway, I recognize this isn't likely to change your mind or anything, and I hope I'm not  sounding like I'm trying to win an argument.

They're great points, seriously.<br/><br/> I'm also not trying to win an argument or anything, just talking about my opinions and reactions to the game. The goofy thing about what I'm saying is that it's all squishy stuff, right? I mean, I keep saying things like "it doesn't do a <i>good enough</i> job" at this or that. It isn't abject failure or anything, and I really do understand why people dig it. I'm just saying I find it to be not-good-enough for what I hoped it'd be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293970/#Comment_293970" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-19T18:23:59+00:00" title="September 19, 2010  6:23PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get you, Matt.

It doesn't matter whether you use the system or not, since the GM can't fail to give you the clues you need to complete the story.<br/><br/>No, it's not. All this mechanic means is that you will never hit a pointless investigative roadblock, not that you are constricted to a single path, or can't improvise. Investgative point spends have other fictional or systematic effects, too. The problem with the D&amp;D Skill Challenge subsystem used in this manner is that the rolls are pointless.

Specifically, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=46889&amp;start=7" rel="nofollow">Skill Challenges have changed again</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can no longer fail overall Skill Challenges. You have a Skill Challenge goal that you achieve... win or lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailing individual rolls have immediate Consequences like losing healing surges, taking damage, wasting time, spending money, and more. Succeeding Hard individual rolls gives you immediate Advantages like canceling a failed roll, gaining part of your goal immediately, and so on. They've changed how group skill checks work (instead of aid another, everyone makes an easy roll, if half the group succeeds, you pass the group check). And Skill Challenges are more structured with guidelines for how many hard or moderate checks to include as well as how to improvise skill use (skills themselves now have individual DCs and suggestions of unique ways to use them that may not be immediately obvious).<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately if our goal is to find the big bad guy and confront him, we're going to do that no matter what. We won't get lost and future prepped encounters won't be wasted. The skill challenge now determines what price we pay to get what we want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294018/#Comment_294018" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T08:35:33+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  8:35AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am I the only one who has used tiered stakes setting for Skill Challenges?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I mean is, the player(s) and I set up the stakes beforehand, but with tiers of success. Basically, you get total success with no failures, and for each failure you get, there's some kind of complication.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one example, I ran a skill challenge for a player of mine who's character was a kobold paladin of bahamut. He had just (with the aid of other adventurers) killed a tyrant red dragon in the area who had the kobolds under its thumb (claw?). Basically, the paladin wanted to "convert" the kobolds. We ran a skill challenge to see how effective the paladin was at recruiting the kobolds for this cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I used 4 successes as the win button, and 3 failures per usual.<br/>\n<br/>\n0 Failures meant that the speech was so effective that nearly all of the kobolds joined his cause and were excited to learn about Bahamut.<br/>\n1 Failure meant most of them were excited to join, but a portion of them (guided by a vocal leader) challenged the paladin and counter-recruited some of the kobolds to march north to join with the dragon's boss.<br/>\n2 Failures meant the same as 1 failure, but also that one of the kobolds who did "convert" were actually a spy and might bring problems down the road.<br/>\n3 Failures meant that nearly all of the kobolds joined up with the vocal opposition and marched northward.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter both agreeing on this, knowing the stakes, we roleplayed it out using skill checks to determine how effective everything was. He used Religion to tell a story about Bahamut and Tiamat's beginnings and how Bahamut is kick ass. He used Diplomacy and Intimidate and other skills as well. I think he had one failure. We roleplayed that the minority marched northward under the promise not to be attacked by the paladin and his crew. Other kobolds eventually arrived after word spread about this new paladin and his conversion and they begin to rebuild the keep where the dragon lived as a new settlement for these kobolds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294039/#Comment_294039" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T10:07:57+00:00" title="September 20, 2010 10:07AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After reading the core rules and trying out the RAW skill challenges a bit I could tell it wasn't for me.
