I've played it with all my siblings, with extremely high levels of silliness - <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=531528" rel="nofollow">see here for details</a> - and I played a couple of rounds yesterday with my brother, using the two-player variant rules.<br/><br/>Our first story turned into a dark comedy of sorts, foreshadowing the Mega Man series (<a href="http://sitouh.tumblr.com/post/978102929/happy-birthday-robot" rel="nofollow">full story here</a>). It's funny how little things can set the tone of the story; when my brother started a sentence with 'You are a perfect creation', the rest of the story practically wrote itself. Mad science dialog is fun!<br/><br/>For our second story, we used a different starting sentence. I've recently gotten my entire family hooked on the Dresden Files, and I remembered someone suggesting, "I need help, Harry Dresden!" as an idea in a comment on Daniel's blog, so we rolled with it. <a href="http://sitouh.tumblr.com/post/978145795/i-need-help-harry-dresden-a-variant-on-happy" rel="nofollow">This story</a> came out rather sillier - it was the flamingos that did it, I think.<br/><br/>One of the great things about Happy Birthday, Robot! is how quickly it plays - I'd played with my brother before, so we both knew the rules which made things go faster, but even so, we came up with both of these stories in under an hour, including the time spent giggling at each others' additions. I am a fan.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287554/#Comment_287554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T11:44:45+00:00" title="August 19, 2010 11:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love, love that Dresden story.

It does make for an interesting change in dynamic - the storyteller each round starts the sentence, but the other person really has the creative power, especially for the first couple sentences, before coins start coming into play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287771/#Comment_287771" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T05:13:25+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  5:13AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's more like the Storyteller is the icebreaker in the early sentences, which gets things flowing for further creative contributions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
