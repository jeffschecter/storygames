I'm going to do a series of quick posts about various pieces of Slip (the setting, the mechanics, the editing).<br/><br/>If you like reviews with numbers and stars, here is how I'd rate Slip:<br/><br/>Overall ****/5<br/>Setting *****/5<br/>Mechanics ****/5<br/>Use of Ingredients ***.5/5<br/><br/><br/>Overall, Slip strikes me as being a rarity in two fields: It's a horror conspiracy game which doesn't rely on investigation and overarching metaplot to pull off its horror; and, it's a reality-bending game that has serious structure to its bizarre, dreamlike landscapes and endcaps on what kinds of weirdness people and their opponents are capable of, which makes it more graspable and employable than other games in its field.<br/><br/>A lot of horror games, especially horror conspiracy games, turn into investigative games. Instead of dealing with the implications of the horror, you're sent off looking for clues - tracking the big evil, tracking clues to stop the big evil, tracking the next big evil, and so on. Slip avoids that in two ways: first, it removes the mysteries and puts the horror in the hands of the players (through player-engineered threats, players choosing their conflicts, and shifting narration rights); second, it gives people meaningful choices which makes the game about coping more than discovering (through options like involving/risking their Trusted person and thing, and slipping for re-rolls).<br/><br/>Levels, slipping and climbing, how things attack, and Threats all give focus and a core to the insane stuff that goes on around you. This means that the game won't devolve into gonzo non-sequiters and crazy-off contests, but will instead have a sense of consistency and building. I think Slip would do wonderfully at maintaining coherency and staying faithful to the setting prose included in the current document.<br/><br/>The mechanics do a great job of enforcing what's cool about the setting. The setting is gorgeous - simple, horrific, bizarre-but-possibly-too-real, and personal.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105472/#Comment_105472" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T23:18:36+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:18PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2007 11:19PM by Mcdaldno.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>SETTING</b><br/><br/>I think Slip has a really cool world. It's got a creation myth that is at once fantastic and unsettlingly immediate feeling. It's got this cool thing where the deeper down the rabbit hole you go, the more simple and obvious and in front of you everything becomes. It's got cars that try to kill you.<br/><br/>My favourite two pieces of prose are the creation myth at the beginning of the document(which is talked about more in the editing post) and the one quoted below:\n<blockquote>Reality becomes simpler the lower one descends, people and places diminished more and<br/>more as one slips towards Five. The complex story of Zero becomes a summary on Two<br/>and a brutal headline on Four.<br/><br/>Some people and things, such as the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s trusted person and object, remain visible<br/>on every level. Some people become caricatures of themselves, subtleties lost.</blockquote>\nWhen you wrote "subtleties lost", the coolness of levels immediately hit me across the face. I was suddenly super excited about the possibility of slipping, and about what slipping meant. The lower you fall, the simpler everything becomes. People can't withstand Five, because at that point it's just flat-out truth and nothing but. The game makes it obvious that truth can destroy a person and is a terrifying, destructive force in the world of Slip.<br/><br/>For me, Slip's feature is the personal horror that comes from trying to deal with a Threat in a world where everything is suddenly hostile. It's hard to survive, let alone right a wrong. Slip is horror because it goads you to accept the fact that you can't distance yourself from your mistakes, and because it asks you to threaten the things that you hold dear* in order to draw strength from them, and because you want to stay dependant on the illusion that most people hold about technology.<br/><br/><br/>*In my mind, incorporating the Trusted Person and Trusted Thing into the fiction of a conflict scene means that you are probably endangering them in some way. Maybe I intentionally read into that wrong, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105474/#Comment_105474" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T23:30:55+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>MECHANICS</b><br/><br/>The 1-20 Traits thing is very cool. It means my rowdy dockworker could be:<br/><br/>Merciless 1-2<br/>dockworker 3-7<br/>heavy drinker 8-10<br/>family man 11-15<br/>Strong swimmer 16-20<br/><br/>Or, he could be:<br/><br/>Merciless 1-8<br/>Dockworker 9-10<br/>Heavy drinker 11-12<br/>family man 13-20.<br/><br/>The first one is cool because he's got a lot of flavour, but is also well rounded. And the second one is cool because although he still has almost as many Traits, it's very obvious how I'm going to go about business. And since Dockworker and Heavy Drinker are in the middle, they are still going to be effective enough when I want to tap them*.<br/><br/>I like the idea of having non-conflict scenes and gaining tweaks through those. It for some reason reminds me of The Horror Revealed from MlwM. There are some cool options with non-conflict scenes in this game, in my mind - exposition on discovering new power gained from the slips, discovering how things work in the world, meeting slipcults, coming face to face with Flesh and hearing Flesh's words and reasoning, etc.<br/><br/>The one thing I'm not juiced about is how Tweaks are gained. I think you should have to do something more than just tap a narrative element. I think you should have to incorporate it in a certain way. The best suggestion I can think about is giving up your Trusted Thing for this conflict gives you a tweak, because abandoning your material anchors allows you to bend the rules of the material world. Another suggestion is risking your Trusted Person for this conflict gives you a tweak, because desperation and need fuels fantastic action.<br/><br/>If I had to do more to get Tweaks, I would feel better about earning them. As is, I would feel guilty trying to tap in multiple Tweaks during a single conflict.<br/><br/>*Because you can both reroll and tweak up/down, if I have 2 tweaks and a re-roll, I just need to get a 7-12 on one of two rolls to succeed with Dockworker. If it'd been an end Trait, though, like Dockworker 19-20, then I'd have a smaller range accessible through tweaks. Therefore, small traits aren't that bad if they're somewhere in the middle, I'm guessing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105475/#Comment_105475" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T23:32:34+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EDITING</b><br/><br/>I think Slip would benefit greatly with some editing down. The writing contains some really beautiful lines and evocative statements, and it'd be nice to pear down the rest so that every line was gripping and bang-on.<br/><br/>I'm going to do a pretend edit of one of your pages, to give you an idea what you mean. Below, what you have is a simple, beautiful, horrific creation tale. You hands down trump the bible's story of the beginning of the world. But one thing this work needs is a bit of editing down. The creation myth should be simple and pointed, and have every sentence drip with flavour.<br/><br/>I'm going to strikethrough the sentences I would simply cut, and if I need to add any segways to it to replace stuff, I'll do it in bold.\n<blockquote>When Man was still a Child, his father was Flesh. Every slight, every insult, every murder<br/>was driven by father Flesh's desires.<br/><br/>Flesh felt shame at Man's limited ability to destroy and create, fuck and kill. So he took a<br/>little part of himself, and made <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a daughter,</span> Machine. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Man took the tools Machine gave him.<br/>A stone axe. Fire. The wheel. Medicine. The tools of farming and the tools of war.</span><br/><br/>Soon, Man had begun to ignore the jealous Flesh and was comforted instead by Machine.<br/><br/>Man was lulled into believing that he created technology.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">A conspiracy of machines arose and the truth was obscured by layers of time and shreds<br/>of mistaken belief \xe2\u20ac\u201c the cities.</span><br/><br/>Everywhere, the cities grew to scrape the sky and cover the land.<br/>Safely hidden under skins of surreality, Machine pulsed and fed.<br/><br/>And Man loved his prison.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Then, envious of Machine\xe2\u20ac\u2122s now-central role, Flesh placed a tiny urge within the brains of<br/>every human, small enough that Machine would not notice these seedlings until the hosts<br/>slipped.<br/><br/>Here and there, across the world, Men would find themselves drifting from the illusory<br/>world of copper and steel, at first just nudged by strange ideas.</span> [<b>But Flesh became jealous, and sought to unseat Machine</b>.] The layers of illusion would<br/>drop away and Man would see the truth before succumbing to the horror.<br/><br/>Flesh gains power in these last days.</blockquote>\nNow, I'll repost the editing down version. Maybe I'm wrong, but I like the edited down version because it gives me just enough to evoke a real emotional/psychological response, but is sparse enough that I'm left wondering and filling in the gaps. Also, removing some of the "...and then this happened, and..." makes it seem less like a history and more like something constant and everpresent and <i>now</i>.\n<blockquote>When Man was still a Child, his father was Flesh. Every slight, every insult, every murder<br/>was driven by father Flesh's desires.<br/><br/>Flesh felt shame at Man's limited ability to destroy and create, fuck and kill.

Make everything feel immediate and personal, rather than distant and over with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105476/#Comment_105476" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T23:39:08+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm planning to play Slip with a few roommates on Wednesday night.
