Anybody who wants in on testing, lemme know.<br/><br/>For those of you not familiar with MADcorp, it's the game of corporate dungeoncrawling horror in a world gone weird. That is, you work for a corporation that delves into abandoned buildings looking for valuable crap. It's the kind of dungeoncrawling where the dungeon is an environment you can go around in any order you want (i.e. magician's choices and pallette swapping are cheating), not the kind where a dungeon is a linear/branching sequence of encounters that you're supposed to "get to the end of." It's "horror" in the sense that it's about horrible things, and tension, and trepidation, rather than being about hack 'n slash (although there's plenty of violence). It's a world gone weird in that there's magic and ghosts and monsters and shit, and dungeons sometimes don't follow the laws of geometry or physics, and dungeoneering like this is a viable and legal avenue for business (as far as the law is concerned, what happens in the dungeon stays in the dungeon). The player characters are all pretty much psychotic but also badass, and the game simultaneously celebrates and makes fun of them. It's very funny, cavalier, and grungy. Overall, it's a bit like <i>kill puppies for satan</i> meets <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Roleplaying</i>.<br/><br/>If you wanna know more, please ask here. Also consider searching this here site for threads with "MADcorp" in the title.<br/><br/>If you want in, please email me at marksman45[at]gmail, and put "MADcorp" in the subject somewhere. Please don't ask for the materials if you aren't serious about planning to give me feedback. If you've got some experience with the alpha version, please try to approach this one fresh: most of the differences are crucial but very subtle, and you might miss them if you don't put the old stuff out of your mind.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341764/#Comment_341764" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T15:14:57+00:00" title="September  6, 2011  3:14PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2011 3:47PM by Marshall Burns.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I forgot.

The primary thing (not only, just primary) that needs development at this time is Referee techniques and advice. Which is a big part of why I need other people to get involved, so that I can say, "No, no, you're doing it wrong," then you can say, "Well maybe you should put that in the book, dipshit," and I can say, "Waitaminnit, maybe I should put that in the book."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
