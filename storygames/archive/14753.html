I'd love to hear any more story based ideas you folks might have!<br/><br/>So......<br/>I'm toying with ideas for creating a new superhero role-playing game engine.  <br/>I'd love to hear any ideas  (from dice and different die-types,  to cards,  or other randomizer based ideas!)  that could simulate the slam-bang fun of superhero comic book action.  I'm looking to create new out-of-the-box ideas, crazy fun ideas,  and rules that become primarily simple and elegant in play.  <br/><br/>I'm also looking at the various other supers RPG systems out there, not to mention other action oriented RPGs, for fun ideas - of what's come before.<br/><br/>I'd love to open a thought here for anyone with anything unique and cool  or  ideas from other past game engines.  Anything you'd like to share for a collective inspiration fun to brainstrom and spin off of!  <br/><br/>Anyone?  Any ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335444/#Comment_335444" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T22:16:40+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 10:16PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxx" rel="nofollow">Fluxx</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335447/#Comment_335447" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T23:00:10+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 11:00PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Here's a supers game:</p>\n<p>CHARACTER CREATION</p>\n<p>Name your guy.

(I think this has some potential for your purposes. Some other RPGs: Hearts &amp; Souls, With Great Power (OOP), and Sage's work-in-progress, Powers for Good. (Which is in-progress, but still a cool project.)<br/><br/>Comics mean a lot of things to various people. I'm curious which comics you want to model.<br/><br/>...This is part of why I like the kernel of Shreyas's idea here. It's a fiction creation engine that adapts itself to the whatever superheroic zeitgeist when it comes to the player. Improvised fictional position needs to be grounded *anyway* by players being on the same page (in terms of cultural references), so we needn't rely on rules to impose on that positioning. Instead, focus on whatever issues are the ones that drive play. (There's also some neat gamesmanship here: if you want your character to matter more, you have to care about more things that are at risk in play.)<br/><br/>A boost to the haptics of ShreyaSupers: these are clearly better suited as index cards as part of the content engine.<br/><br/>1. Each player picks their own color of index cards.<br/>2. Each player writes one issues on each colored index card. These are added to the event deck.<br/>3. Each player takes 1d6 index cards and simply writes the word "ACTION!" on them. Add these to the event deck. This is for some randomization and to interpolate the action.<br/>4. Shuffle the event deck.<br/><br/>On your turn to frame a scene, draw from the deck. Scene frame and you're ready. You can adjust the number of action cards to fit the kind of comicbook: 1d2 index cards if this issues was written by JMS, 4d10 if it was inked by Liefeld.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335484/#Comment_335484" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T07:58:35+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  7:58AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>On your turn to frame a scene, draw from the deck.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Love it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335488/#Comment_335488" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T08:12:53+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  8:12AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, I can't speak fork ev, but yeah, there is definitely uncovered ground in those. Mostly in how they approach the heroes. Where's the game that does superhero stories, not superhero 'simulation,' in a fast-playing package, which actually encourages play as superheroes, not just guys with superpowers? I don't think any of those create anything like Morrison's JLA, which is pretty much by benchmark for the subject (I've <a href="http://www.latorra.org/category/games/powers-for-good/page/7/" rel="nofollow">written a bit about it</a>).<br/><br/>My own take on it is that:<br/><br/>a) Characters need to mostly be about how you describe your character's actions, not relative power. Batman takes down four superpowered aliens that can each beat Superman, for ex. Neither Supes nor Bats is "stronger," they just have different current resources and different abilities they channel those resources through.<br/><br/>b) The team needs to be a solid thing that influences the game<br/><br/>c) The game needs to be tightly focused on one type of superheroes. The game that does Captain Britain and MI-13 is badly-suited for Runaways.<br/><br/>d) The GM needs real, concrete, moment-to-moment tools to create opposition and threats with.<br/><br/><br/>I've been working on the game that does these things, Powers For Good.

I think one of the big advantages of comics: iconic, quickly recognizable characters, addressed by diverse creators, is that you can do all kinds of interesting things with them if you don't tie yourself down to continuity and constantly box yourself further and further in. I think shaking up theme and/or scale can also be useful.

I'm really curious about the answers.  What superhero games have you played?  What did and didn't you like about them?  Why do you want to design another one?  That's kinda what I was getting at above. <br/><br/>If you want to create "new out-of-the-box ideas" ... superhero RPGs are a pretty freaking huge box.  When you say...\n<blockquote>I'm toying with ideas for creating a new superhero role-playing game engine. <br/>I'd love to hear any ideas (from dice and different die-types, to cards, or other randomizer based ideas!) that could simulate the slam-bang fun of superhero comic book action. I'm looking to create new out-of-the-box ideas, crazy fun ideas, and rules that become primarily simple and elegant in play. </blockquote>\nit seems to me that you haven't done your homework.  Shoot, I failed to mention Anima Prime, Big Eyes/Small Mouth, and Primetime Adventures above.  That's 12 games I ticked off basically without even looking too hard, all of which do superheroes to varying degrees.  I've played six of them and had exposure to four others.  <br/><br/>My question is, what will your game do that the six games that I've played, and the who-knows-how-many I haven't, don't do?  Why should I choose it over those others?  <br/><br/>Sage, I'd love to see your game.<br/><br/>Edit: Superhero 2044!
