While harper is far from an obscure designer, I believe <i>The Mustang</i> is an incredibly underrated entry in his body of work. Harper is frequently praised for games like <i>Ghost Echoes, Lasers and Feelings</i>, and <i>Lady Blackbird</i>. Also I was happy to see <i>Blades in the Dark</i> receive such a warm reception. However, his whole catalogue is worth exploring.<br/><br/>The system is really simple and opens players who enjoy roleplay and storytelling to explore many emotional spaces. The "fill in the blank" flashbacks, and built in tension of waiting for "you" to call out a warning that the Mustang approaches creates easy tension. <br/><br/>I want to note that the system is not doing heavy lifting. It isn't the sort of game you can give to someone to help them get more comfortable with looser story gaming. It leans heavily on groups of players who are comfortable making bold creative choices.<br/><br/>I'm used to doing humorous games, but it is nice to break form and do some drama every now and then.
