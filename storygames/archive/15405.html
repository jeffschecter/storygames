The general idea is that there's all these situations out there in this world gone weird that the players can choose to insert themselves in, in order to leverage the situations toward personal gain. As part of that system, I want PCs (and the resources available to them) to be able to progress along several tracks: experience, wealth, fame, infamy, and recognizance of deeds by powers that be. Basically it's a pick-you-prize thing, once you've accumulated enough points in an individual category to earn a "Perk."<br/><br/>Experience I've got down. Help me think of Perks for the others.<br/><br/>When you get wealthier, you could:<br/>- Buy some property (house, land, etc.)<br/>- Buy controlling interest in a corporation<br/>- Start a business<br/><br/>When you get famous, you could:<br/>- Get a corporate sponsorship<br/>- Star in a reality show<br/>- Get a movie deal<br/><br/>When you get infamous, you could:<br/>- Have an "in" with (insert shady/criminal group here)<br/>- Have a badass reputation in (insert region here)<br/><br/>When you perform enough deeds, you could:<br/>- Receive a title from a ruler<br/>- Receive an official appointment from a ruler<br/>- Rise through the ranks of a ruler's army or whatever<br/><br/>And maybe there's some combinations. Enough Fame + Deeds and maybe you could campaign for governor of some territory or other and get elected.<br/><br/>Any ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349560/#Comment_349560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T11:58:31+00:00" title="November 23, 2011 11:58AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you get famous, you could just get more famous, sensu-Warhol*-famous, Paris Hilton-famous, with no additional benefit.

He wouldn't be especially good at killing goblins, and wouldn't have a lot of stuff, but he'd always be in the writeups.<br/><br/>So, some other stuff, riffing on this. I've always wished that bards mattered more in my games, that there were a meaningful fame mechanic just slightly more interesting than the stupid reputation rolls most games offer. I would love to have:<br/><br/>When you get wealthier, you could:<br/> - Establish a brand<br/> - Extend your brand (sponsor other adventurers?)<br/><br/>When you get sponsored:<br/> - Clothing/gear line (like MMA fighters and board sport athletes sometimes do IRL)<br/>  -- this would be especially cool in MadCorp, with its look rules! IRL, I get a warm feeling when I run into people wearing Steelers jerseys... it would be fun if you could start off with +1 bond for other people wearing the same adventurer/team's gear. "Oh, so you're a Gwarl Ovenwhisper fan, too?" "Yeah, man, how about the way he ran the Flickering Exit Sign! So sweet!"<br/> - Perfume or potion<br/> - More famous, no other benefits<br/> - Internet highlight videos with properly licensed (or custom-commissioned) music                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349569/#Comment_349569" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T14:06:02+00:00" title="November 23, 2011  2:06PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2011 2:06PM by Krippler.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Infamy could be used straight as a bonus to intimidation but also to measure the price on your head when you get one. After all, a high price indicates difficulty/danger in catching you rather than urgency. From this you could derive how high profile any bounty hunters will be as well. Also getting threatened by someone infamous is way scarier than someone who just <i>looks</i> dangerous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349579/#Comment_349579" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T15:33:31+00:00" title="November 23, 2011  3:33PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!
