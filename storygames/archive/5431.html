And some pictures, because it's what I like to do.<br/>I'd like people to do the same thing and post their stuff here so that we can have a kind of actually tested monsters and some insight on game prep. Drawings are totally optional. Doodles are welcome as usual.<br/><br/>First game : the heart ripping gargoyle<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/gargoyle_color.gif" style="border: 0px;"/><br/>The Old Market has a lot of gargoyles but only one wakes at night to rip the heart from people touched with magic.<br/>Actual play thread here : <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4838&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4838&amp;page=1</a><br/><br/>The gargoyle :<br/>Size +3<br/>Awarness : +3<br/>Sneakiness : +6<br/>Other attributes : +0<br/>Weapons :<br/>Claws (Heavy)<br/>Tail (Ranged)<br/>Armor :<br/>Light<br/>Powers :<br/>Unliving (15 HP instead of 10)<br/>Disguised (The monster can pass as something armless : automatic surprise on the initiative)<br/>Please note that we were running with the first iteration of the rules and that I used a personal version of the attributes and the monsters powers of this version.<br/>The creazy hit points load was lame because it made the fight drag on. I found in later game that it was better to have a monster with a good armor than with too much hit points.<br/><br/>For this game I came up with some backstory using Vincent Baker's oracles. Then I made the NPCs "grabby", in need of the visibly capable PCs or wanting them far from their busyness<br/><br/>Setting and backstory : an Old Market at a crossroad. The PCs are mercenaries seeking some employment with merchants. Murders start the first night. People are found dead, heart ripped. All the victims are magic users. There is a merchant possessed by the ghost of a wizard. This man commited suicide because of a love despair but cannot go because of guilt : he left behind him his animated gargoyle that has started to murder magic-users for their heart. He thinks it's because it needs magic to sustain itself. In fact the creature feels lonely and want to create a mate. So there are in fact 2 gargoyles. But the second one is not ready yet and will only be when the PCs kill the first one and start to feel safe.<br/>To complicate the matters : the merchant has a wife who quickly realised that her husband was not her husband anymore because he doesn't beat her anymore. He also has a brother who realised something was wrong when his brother did not recognise him. The man is ruthless and has a lot of mercenaries following his orders but he doesn't want to hurt his brother so he went to find an exorcist on the market. The ghost want the help of the PCs to kill the gargoyle. The wife wants the help of the PCs with the brother problem. She wants to keep her man with the ghost inside.<br/><br/>The monster hunting and fighting part was realy great. Lots of crazy tactics. Players really immersed and all.<br/><br/>I did wrong with the treasure part  in this game. It was a jewelled dagger that some NPCs had stolen from the dead wizard. The ghost told them who was the NPC and told them they could keep it if they could take it. It was lame from the start and it felt in game. It would have been better for exemple to have the brother possess something of great value.<br/><br/>I'll come back with more monsters. Now I am back to work. Your turn.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121785/#Comment_121785" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T16:37:43+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  4:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice one Antoine - great backstory too !

The reach weapon bonus.  I'd forgotten.  There you go.</p>\n<p>The "natural weapons" isssue is probably just a bad label for a nifty power.  It does seem to imply that your Arctic Monkey should have it.  But that's not what I'd intended.

Natural Weapons does kind of imply that you can't take that power AND use a weapon of a particular type. Is that your intent, Eric?<br/><br/>For instance, can a monster have Natural Weapons and use a "light weapon"? In that case, how many d10s does the monster roll?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124896/#Comment_124896" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T06:20:06+00:00" title="February  7, 2008  6:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2008 6:22AM by Antoine_F.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Sons of the Goat God.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/sons_of_the_goat_god_color.gif" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/>Basicaly, they are like Runequest's Broos : male humanoids with a goat head and a solid craving for sex and rape. This is one of my favorite monster of all time. They are realy monsters in the RBH sense : "creatures that do terrible things with terrible consequences".<br/>But in fact they came back too me through the Burning Wheel's Monster Burner and its Satyr.

I had also added "Internal fire" but I dropped it almost immediatly because the monsters were already too powerfull.<br/><br/>The Champion was a panzer division in itself : it could have 4 actions in one turn, at it's best : 1 normal action + 1 free attack (Many headed) + 1 move (fast) + 1 show-off (vicious with a successfull attack).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
