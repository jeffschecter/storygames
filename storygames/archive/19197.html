It is not the place of the GM to win out<br/>against the players; even in \u201cEmpire Strikes Back\u201d<br/>and \u201cThe Two Towers,\u201d the Heroes were far from<br/>utterly defeated, lest the stories just be over with a<br/>lousy ending. Yet the Game Master is very much<br/>expected to challenge the Heroes, or else the game<br/>becomes little more than an exercise in flexing might<br/>and cleverness for a few rounds, wondering what the<br/>next campaign might be like.<br/><br/>Realize that from the very beginning, you\u2019re being<br/>ganged up on. Your players are each maximizing the<br/>abilities of their Novice Rank Heroes against whatever<br/>you throw at them, and doing so in conjunction<br/>with their fellows. By the time they reach Heroic<br/>and Legendary Rank, they know their characters<br/>like snipers know their favorite rifles, and those<br/>characters are pointed directly at everything you do<br/>and are used with precision to devastating results.<br/><br/>However, you have the right and, frankly, the<br/>responsibility to at least occasionally grab the<br/>strands of Fate and twist reality to make things more<br/>interesting and entertaining. In order to enjoy and<br/>savor their victories, battles need to be hard won and<br/>successes need to come at great effort and, sometimes,<br/>cost.<br/><br/>Blatant, naked cheating, however, is going to<br/>be held with a dim view. Your players are going to<br/>expect you to go through at least some kind of ritual<br/>or process to pull any stunts against them. At the very<br/>least, you need to carefully conceal your cheats so that<br/>everything happens behind-the-scenes, while out in<br/>front of the camera, all seems to be going as it was.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427923/#Comment_427923" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-03T22:19:17+00:00" title="February  3, 2014 10:19PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427924/#Comment_427924" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-03T22:20:00+00:00" title="February  3, 2014 10:20PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is what I call "classic Illusionism advice," and I thought I'd share it here.

So you cannot just<br/>dump more on there. You can, however, subtly add<br/>more bennies to individual Wild Cards. Though the<br/>standard enemy Wild Card has two personal bennies,<br/>I will often have more important ones carry three,<br/>four, or even five of their own if they have a key role<br/>to fulfill. Players do not necessarily need to know<br/>how many personal bennies such a character has; this<br/>can be an excellent way to give one or two more Soak<br/>rolls, re-rolls, or whatever when you need to juice the<br/>opposition. Save those core bennies for the final run<br/>down to the end of the conflict.<br/><br/><b>Surprise Abilities</b><br/><br/>I cannot tell you how many times I\u2019ve realized<br/>\u201cDang it, I should have given him Improved Frenzy!\u201d<br/>Well, guess what? Do it. Right there, on the spot.<br/>From a narrative perspective, the villain can reveal<br/>her talents unexpectedly; she didn\u2019t open up the<br/>fight showing off a given skill level, Edge, ability, or<br/>Power, but that could just mean she was waiting for<br/>the perfect time to catch her opponent by surprise.<br/>Not only is this a perfectly acceptable cheat, but your<br/>players will get a kick out of the cinematic conceit.<br/>Although they might also get a stabbing, burning, or<br/>chomping out of it, too.<br/><br/><b>Unlisted Bonuses</b><br/><br/>In other words, \u201cfudging.\u201d When a Bad Guy misses<br/>a roll by one or two, you really should feel free to<br/>at least once in a while kick the number up. Maybe<br/>the sword has an extra enchantment to hit, or the<br/>assassin got a Boost Trait for his Stealth skill that only<br/>just kicked in. You don\u2019t even really have to justify<br/>these number-nudges, unless you\u2019re the kind of GM<br/>who rolls everything out in the open. If that\u2019s the case<br/>be ready to simply say there are bonuses at work and<br/>leave it at that.<br/><br/><b>Healing Items</b><br/><br/>Magic items do not flow from factories in Shaintar,<br/>but if anyone should have a potion of Healing or a<br/>ring with Fast Regeneration on it, a main villain for<br/>a Legendary campaign should. These are not meant<br/>to be found and stuffed into the Heroes\u2019 trove of<br/>goodies; they should be used, and used up before a<br/>battle is over.<br/><br/><b>Surprise Allies and Reinforcements</b><br/><br/>Are the Heroes cleaning up the board before the<br/>first round of combat is even over? Fine, that was the<br/>warm-up; now comes the force of warriors, monsters,<br/>or even a handful of bad-to-the-bone Wild Cards<br/>that are the \u201creal threat.\u201d It pays to have such entities<br/>written up and on hand for use as needed.<br/><br/><b>Bad Guys Pray, Too</b><br/><br/>Remember it\u2019s not only the Heroes who have allies<br/>among the divine; Demon Lords, Necrolords, and<br/>their more powerful agents often take a liking to a<br/>particular servant or chosen warrior. Sometimes,<br/>when all seems lost for that person, his patron may<br/>well decide to not leave him hanging in the wind,<br/>instead providing some kind of assistance. Or,<br/>perhaps, an escape.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427935/#Comment_427935" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-04T06:29:58+00:00" title="February  4, 2014  6:29AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For context, this is a book for running epic adventures in the Shaintar setting.

In boardgame and video game design you basically either create symmetrical scenarios, or you playtest your brains out to ensure that there are interesting, fair challenges in your setup. For a roleplaying game the latter is very, very difficult, as the scenarios are usually not played thousands or even millions of times, which those other types of games are, thus justifying the amount of work it takes to craft balanced challenges manually.<br/><br/>As everybody here probably already knows, D&amp;D went the way of systemic encounter balancing with the 3rd edition in an attempt to solve the problem and get out of the illusionistic solution that Shaintar seems to use. I personally find both of these solutions severely deficient in comparison with the classical negotiated challenges used in wargaming and old school rpgs.<br/><br/>Shaintar's solution is the traditional one, though: pre-make something that seems roughly right, and ensure a flexible approximation of balance by fine-tuning on the go. It works in the sense of not requiring playtesting before using it in play, which is sort of a minimal requirement for make-it-yourself rpg scenarios. I myself lose all interest in the supposed "challenge" when a game is played in this way, but if you're into it for the theatrics (as opposed to genuine player-level challenge), then it doesn't make much of a difference, which explains a lot about its popularity. And it's not like there are too many alternatives: I identify three solutions above (negotiate challenges, cheat, or use some sort of point-buy system), and can't off-hand name any more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427942/#Comment_427942" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-04T11:44:42+00:00" title="February  4, 2014 11:44AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since this is printed in the main book it seems insane to say that players of the game don't know it's happening even if you do forget to mention it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427943/#Comment_427943" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-04T11:46:54+00:00" title="February  4, 2014 11:46AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Point-buy systems are notoriously difficult to build as well.

If I bungled in the other direction I'm a fan of using the defeat to drive story) (and 5 would be the only one I'd consider), but yeah I would expect a player to be basically familiar with the game before play.<br/><br/>If I know that I'm playing with a group that DOESN'T have that familiarity then I'll go out of my way to make sure that the players understand what techniques are being used. But ANY GAME is going to have problems if the players don't have a solid expectation. Go look at any thread here about problems running Fate or Apocalypse World and you'll see that letting players know what is expected of them is one of the first troubleshooting tips. <br/><br/>Player ignorance of the system is not an problem unique to "illusionism" (whatever definition we're using this week), but just a general bad practice.

Shaintar is a Savage Worlds setting. Players are expected to know the Savage Worlds rules and a handful of setting-specific things for their character plus some basic setting knowledge, all of which are available in the <i>Player's Guide</i>. The <i>Legends Unleashed</i> book--especially the GM section containing the text I quoted--is really aimed at the GM only. It's full of setting secrets and other spoilers. Doesn't mean a player might not read it, but I don't think there's an <i>expectation</i> that the player will read this.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427966/#Comment_427966" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-04T15:41:25+00:00" title="February  4, 2014  3:41PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2014 3:41PM by JDCorley.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if a player doesn't care to know what principles a GM is applying, and so passes on reading the book (as I agree many do!), how does that pass responsibility to the GM, or worse, to the designer, who are not involved in that decision?<br/><br/>No, it's all participationism - the only ones that don't know are those that don't care.

Simply put, the combat has a high degree of randomness. I found that frequently enemies that seemed quite tough would be defeated in the opening moves of a fight by exploding dice. But if you pump enemies up enough that they can survive the occasional super successful player action, then they are then way too hard the rest of the time.<br/><br/>Also, combat is based on beating toughness/parry only a small proportion of the time, but once you do enemies only being able to take a couple of hits. Unlike a hitpoint system where progress is more consistent. So I found that if you made enemies even a bit tougher it was easy to fall into a situation where randomness would lead to a fight that took forever, because the players couldn't land any blows.<br/><br/>I ended up fairly rapidly cheating in this way, just to try and even out some of the randomness and keep combat interesting.

Explain?<br/><br/><br/>My personal definition of consent doesn't include "you didn't read the rulebook to know that I was told to cheat, so that's your fault." I think the social contract lives at a higher level than the rules text, and there's a social contract that players and GM won't cheat. That is, cheating breaks the social contract. <br/><br/>The designer's advice doesn't say "the game doesn't balance encounters well at epic power levels, so for God's sake, talk to your players about this and agree that some fudging will be necessary." It says, "Cheat." It says, "At the very least, you need to carefully conceal your cheats." It says, "Feel free" to inform the players you'll cheat, but "honestly, they should expect it" (a sentiment mirrored by a few people in the thread). <br/><br/>This is advice buried in the GM's section that a player is neither expected to read, and might be expected <i>not</i> to read (to avoid reading GM-only setting spoilers).<br/><br/><br/>I realize "invalidating player choices" is loaded language. I don't know how else to word it. The players make a choice. The GM uses Force (GNS/Forge term) to choose an outcome other than the one that naturally makes sense. If the GM is going to finesse or fudge outcomes so that they turn out a certain way <i>regardless of what the players do</i>, then obviously, that invalidates / moots / diminishes player choices.

In my experience, at most game tables the majority of the people playing have not read the rulebook, or at least certainly not cover-to-cover. Generally speaking, even an established, long-term group will usually just have one copy of the rules on hand. While it's certainly possible that they could take turns lending that one book to each player for a week or two so that s/he could read it... that's pretty rare, and would take a while.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428006/#Comment_428006" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T11:29:49+00:00" title="February  5, 2014 11:29AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, yes, there are many reasons people don't care (enough?) about what their GM is doing/thinking.

That seems like a design problem.<br/><br/>I'm only guessing, but I think Sean understands that it's important to hide this from the players <i>not only</i> to make the game fun, but also to keep players from feeling, well, <i>cheated</i>. That's an ethical problem. Sean's use of the word "cheat" (once in square-quotes, certainly) supports this, I think.<br/><br/>Here's an example from his "Bennies" suggestions:\n<blockquote><br/>I cannot tell you how many times I\u2019ve realized \u201cDang it, I should have given him Improved Frenzy!\u201d Well, guess what? Do it. Right there, on the spot.<br/></blockquote>\nThis comes down to creative agenda, right? If you're playing to support a challenge-based game, this advice is broken. The players have an expectation of a fair fight. The GM does her prep up front, and the players meet that head-on, and let the chips fall where they may. Sean suggests that the game works in such a way as to favor the players too one-sidedly in a way that isn't fun to play. So cheat. Okay, maybe that's the right design fix.<br/><br/>However, I'm not sure "Feel free to tell them" is the right ethical advice. By God, talk to your friends about how you're gonna have to "cheat" to make the game fun. If they already know you do that, it will be a very quick discussion. If they don't know and don't mind, it will be a quick discussion. If they don't want you to play that way, you shouldn't play that way. A quick discussion settles this with consent among all participants.<br/><br/>Offer some GM advice for making better, balanced encounters. <br/><br/>Perhaps create some player bennies that let THEM "cheat," openly, to manage encounters that might be too difficult for them, then tell the GM to build really tough encounters. After all, this is legendary play, so they can expect to be up against some really tough problems. Let them choose when to spend their "Deus Ex Machina" resources to beat a nearly impossible challenge. I'll bet that's more fun, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428013/#Comment_428013" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T13:06:03+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  1:06PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2014 1:07PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay, yes, there are many reasons people don't care (enough?) about what their GM is doing/thinking.

It's not going to improve this discussion.<br/><br/>I'm not presuming those things. I'm talking about my own experiences. Most times in my player group, I bring a new game to the table, and I'm the only one who has read it cover to cover. Sometimes the players don't even have access to a copy of it (that is, they could buy one, but they haven't). <br/><br/>The last time someone taught you a board game, did you read the rules, or did you let someone explain the rules to you and play along? That's my usual experience with RPGs. It's usually me (in a GM role), and I'm the one who 1) buys the game, 2) selects the game, 3) pitches the game to the group for a "play/don't play" vote, 4) reads the game rules, 5) introduces the game rules, and 6) runs the game. Any one of them could borrow the game, and they might pick it up and leaf through it, but they rarely read it cover to cover. There's no need; it would not significantly improve their enjoyment.<br/><br/>For a setting book, this is doubly so. If we were to play a Shaintar Legends Unleashed campaign, they'd probably learn Savage Worlds and some of them would flip through the Player's Guides. They'd work with me to make characters. I'd be responsible for introducing the rules, understanding them, and running the game. That's how division of labor plays out with my friends.<br/><br/>I definitely don't <i>expect</i> that my players read the <i>GM section</i> of a setting book. I definitely don't assume they're lazy for not doing so.<br/><br/><br/>I also don't assume that the GM is an evil demon. I do have ethical problems with Illusionist play. To me, it's a bit sketchy. It's also asking too much of the GM to figure out how and when to "cheat" to make sure the game is fun for everyone, especially when different players might want different things out of play. When I play a challenge-based D&amp;D game, GM fudging <i>spoils the fun for me</i>, regardless of which direction she fudges in. From my Internet discussions, I know I am not the only player who feels this way, so I feel that a "GM advice" section that advocates this behavior to be dodgy advice at best.<br/><br/>The GM should not be solely responsible for fun. If the GM is tasked with knowing when to retroactively change the state of the fiction to produce a fun outcome, that's putting a lot on the GM. It also forces the GM to make decisions like, "if I make this battle more challenging and more fun, and that ends up killing a character, do I wave my GM-Fiat-wand to undo the death somehow, especially if the player didn't do anything dumb, and how much do I need to hide the fact that I'm undoing the death, and that I was the cause of the death in the first place?" That's a crappy place to put a GM. <br/><br/>So, no, I'm not demonizing the GM. I have great sympathy for the GM and feel we should protect her more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428015/#Comment_428015" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T13:11:50+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  1:11PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The GM now has a non-resolvable dilemma: she is supposed to cheat and hide it from the players, so as to improve the game.

I think, if the GM is aware that the players may not like it (terms like "cheat" and "conceal" and "pull any stunts" suggest the GM knows), then it's ethically dodgy.

I think somehere in there is a real clash between gamism and simulationism ( specifically genre emulation stuff).<br/><br/>I don't think it comes up in narrativism because people are already playing to find out what happens, and no matter which way things go, as long as they go somewhere, it's okay, and you can expect players to drive things along if that's the priority without nudging much.<br/><br/>What I really, really think is that for lots of people, RPGs are mostly Play Pretend ( source material emulation. Often genre, though I guess it doesn't absolutley need to be...) with lightweight gamism moments to spice things up.<br/><br/>I mean, really, I think that's the drive for most players.<br/><br/>So, I dunno. Yes, participationism by default, I guess?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428034/#Comment_428034" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T14:35:20+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  2:35PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I ran a lot of games like that in my time. I used every technique on the list above. We also had a handful of pretty serious arguments at the table, and I can attribute a lot of them to the consequences of GM hocus-pocus, and the players finding out.<br/><br/>The players were usually happy for me to fudge openly when it aided them: a reroll or a second chance for them. If they realized that I was adding more goblins to make a too-weak encounter more challenging for them, they'd be annoyed. It was /cheating/ to them. As SPF says, "Blatant, naked cheating, however, is going to be held with a dim view," but what does that really mean? It means, "GM, you have to cheat or the game will suck, and if the players find out, that might suck even more."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428035/#Comment_428035" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T14:41:29+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  2:41PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2014 2:43PM by komradebob.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             I got in a massive argument with a very good buddy once over illusionist techniques used in a Call of Cthulhu game.<br/><br/>Mind you, it was one guy out of the group. He was a very gamist minded dude. After the adventure as over, he went and found the scenario and read it, came back from break ( we were college roomies) and bitched me out something fierce.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, none of the other players minded at the time we played, nor afterwards.<br/><br/>Notably, they asked me to uninvite this guy from playing, even though we'd hang out socially ( and he's still a good friend).<br/><br/>I suspect that as a case of Participationism ( and some of the other stuff I mentioned) by Default, clashing with a gamist agenda.<br/><br/>Personally, I think a whole lot of standard game design and advice is pretty messy, and puts a whole lot on the GM to carry things, and does it with over-engineered mechanics, especially if what most people are looking for is Play Pretend with Lite Gamism.

If you need a full refresher, go <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4&amp;page=1</a><br/><br/>I'm going to make another recommendation: try to keep your posts to one coherent point or train of thought. Often times, a lot of interesting ideas come up in a thread: the blockquote style of responding point by point to each other can be hard to follow, and at its worst, it can lead to antagonism. So try to stick to one line of argument, and if there's a tangent which seems interesting, start a new thread.<br/><br/>As always, talk to me if you've got any questions.

class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDIT: the "slow down" happened as a cross-post. I would prefer if my musing about the topic were not actively engaged in these conditions, as I wouldn't be able to fairly retort in a timely manner. Fortunately I don't say anything particularly discussion-engendering here, so it should be all right to just let my phrasings stand as they are. (If you absolutely want to talk about this stuff with me specifically, private correspondence is always an option.)<br/><br/>I think you're debating this very nicely, Adam. Yesterday I felt the temptation to get into another round of bashing my head against this topic, but now I see that you've said everything I wanted to say, and probably in a less argumentative manner, too. I think it is a fine thing to call the trad game writers about their assumptions these days; it is not the case that this same two-faced vagueness is OK today just because it was the standard 20 years ago. You're entirely correct when you outline some simple, practical means of designing a game like this in a way that makes secret fudging unnecessary or actual part of the game. Heck, making it explicitly participationist is probably the best possible way, as it's utterly simple and acts to immediately bring everybody at the table on the same level as collaborators, who may now enjoy the GM's artistry with appreciation instead of mis-attributing the game events to "luck" or "skill" on their own part. (And because this is the Internet, with permanent dyslexia, I clarify: I did not say here that making a game like this is morally wrong, I just said that I think this sort of game design is well past its best-before date, and I expect games nowadays to be better to be worth my time. This is me saying that I don't like this sort of game design, and why I don't like it; merely a declaration of preference.)<br/><br/>For a game that is participationist-by-default, I would like to recommend <i>Paranoia</i> for consideration: it is a game that uses illusionistic techniques with abandon, but it is also communicated clearly to the group playing the game (either by reading the rules, or by simply hearing the GM explain it - the premise of the game is utterly impossible to get without also picking up the ironical GM-as-dictator aspect of it), so that I've never played Paranoia without the players knowing that the GM is basically fudging everything on his side. This makes reading Paranoia adventure modules an exercise in irony, of course, as it's not like they'd know how to shift gears and write a participationist adventure module, and thus end up doing all the unnecessary legwork with making a railroad function without overt GM arbitrariness <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(I think it's illustrative of the participationism resistance that Adam mentioned how Paranoia was, and could only be, a satire of society and parody of rpg group dynamics. Its overt participationism can be accepted because of its carnevalistic nature; it enables us to talk about what the GM <i>really</i> does, but doing it within the safe borders of the carneval, so that we can then leave and go back into playing games where the GM pretends that he's not an all-knowing, arbitrary dictator.)<br/><br/>I should emphasize that what Adam describes as illusionism seems to me entirely uncontroversial, and just like him, I encounter illusionism of this sort routinely in real play. Just this winter I've been playing an <i>Only War</i> campaign with my brother and a bunch of other people, and it's totally an illusionistic exercise with mild gamist elements. (That is, Markku will probably let a mission fail or a character die if the failure is dramatic enough, but meanwhile my character can do basically whatever he wants without fear of serious consequences.) This isn't even a case of a GM having been brought up in a barrel; Markku knows what he's doing, and he probably knows that I know what he's doing; it's just that the entire rules system of these FFG Warhammer games is so entirely rooted in illusionism that it would be nigh impossible to run a successful campaign without playing fast and loose with dicing stakes and modifiers. (The normal way to fudge in this game is for the GM to determine big, big modifiers for various dice rolls, ostensibly on objective basis, in reality based on his gut feeling for what he wants to happen. If a roll fails regardless, it's easy enough to redefine what the roll meant a posteori, at least outside combat.) I obviously don't mind this personally, as I'm <i>just a smidgen</i> more aware about how rpgs function than most hobbyists, so it's not like I'm exactly confounded by what the game is supposed to be doing here. Whatever entertains the rest of the group, I'm fine with that for this particular game with these particular people at this particular time. Doesn't change that it's illusionistic, and I experience the dynamic about biweekly for the last several months, so I take it with a grain of salt when people claim that illusionism doesn't exist.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428050/#Comment_428050" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T21:51:55+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  9:51PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You're probably right about "how the sausage is made."

Being arbitrary, unfair, deceitful, discriminatory, nepotistic, antagonistic, dismissive, etc will break the contract at most tables. Bad GMing can happen in any type of game with any set of GM techniques. <br/><br/>And I think we all agree that there is a set of techniques that privilege narrative over mechanics in RPGs. This is distinct from systems like Apocalypse World or Fate that try to make the mechanics about the narrative. <br/><br/>What's not clear is that this set of techniques (which is what I would call illusionism) in some way requires a special term for Bad GMing that uses them. The problem we run into over and  over again with this conversation is that the Illusionism/Participationism definition set that is proposed has no real difference in technique. <br/><br/>So you've proposed two definitions that describe the exact same techniques differentiated only by whether those techniques break the tables social contract. Then when encountering that set of techniques you automatically assume that they will be used in the way that breaks said contract. <br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because the entire point of having a special word to define bad GMing that priveleges narrative over mechanics is to provide a short hand prejorative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428060/#Comment_428060" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T06:23:21+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  6:23AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2014 6:30AM by C_Edwards.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I'm missing something, but the text Adam quoted specifically suggests keeping the players in the dark about the techniques being used. Yes, the defining element that separates Participationism from Illusionism exists at the social contract level. That is not an insignificant detail. It's a critical piece that, when manipulated poorly, can bring the whole tower down.<br/><br/>Illusionism isn't bad GMing. The problem is when Illusionism conflicts with player expectations. All Participationism does is help eliminate expectation clashes by giving players a peek behind the curtain.

It seemed like a natural necessity of play if you were going for any sort of "story" based play.  Players had to accept the GM's plot to start in just the same way that you have to accept that your characters are trying to solve the mystery in a Call of Cthulhu game.  You couldnt just play your character as they would react in this situation, you had to accept that your character would be interested in these strange events and try and solve them.  This isnt the same thing as illusionism but it is participation if not participationism right from the start.  You accept what the gm has set out from the start so why shouldnt you later when the walls start popping up that keep the group on the straight and narrow, following the path the gm has created.<br/><br/>We often had poor gm's to start and they relied more on participationism, they didnt have the skill to create an illusion that what happened was really created by player choice.  The Illusionist provided the better play experience precisely because they could hide the fact that outcomes were predetermined.  The really good ones could even handle the twists and turns from players pushing in unexpected directions.  To play in such a manner, with a detailed preplanned plot which is what was assumed everyone wanted in playing such a game was impossible without the players actively being on side at least in part.  I think players had to deceive themselves to think it wasnt so.  I never had a problem with playing in this style but I couldnt run games like this.  I had neither the illusionist ability to pull off the trick or the ability to conceive of a plotline that I thought could make strong enough to survive impact with the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428076/#Comment_428076" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T11:21:32+00:00" title="February  6, 2014 11:21AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2014 11:31AM by lumpley.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read the quoted text not as advice but as a straightforward expression of agenda and principles. Agenda: "Make sure the PCs win, but make the challenges seem real." Principle: "Cheat when you have to."<br/><br/>This makes the listed "cheats" well-designed and suitable enough, I think. I'd even just call them GM moves. They give me, as GM, tools I can use in pursuit of my goal. <br/><br/>Whether the rest of the game is well-designed to this goal I wouldn't hazard, but the quoted text all seems coherent* to me.<br/><br/>The question to me isn't whether this is illusionist or participationist. (Ans: schmillusionist, schmarticipationist.) The questions to me are: Can the game ask me to play this way? Should it?<br/><br/>I think it's undeniable that the game can, yes, ask me to play this way. Why couldn't it? I mean, after all, it does, right?<br/><br/>I also think that nobody gets to say what a game should do and should never do. I get to say whether I'll play it or not, given that it is what it is, but not whether it "should." "Should" belongs to the gods.<br/><br/>* Not a technical term.

People get to critique games, and that's basically saying what a game <i>should</i>, right? I'm pretty sure that no one here is saying that Sean should not have written the game the way he wanted to. We're critiquing his particular choices, in service of a) figuring out if that's the kind of game we'd want to play, and b) figuring out how to play games better. At least that's why I'm here.<br/><br/>A game could ask me to punch my friends in the face, and I'd feel pretty comfortable saying the author <i>shouldn't</i> write that. I won't stop someone from saying whatever they want in a book, but I don't mind criticizing what I don't like.<br/><br/>I also wanted to post the text as an example of modern texts saying those things, because I've seen people argue that no one really says those things. Yes, they do.<br/><br/>I'm happy to get on board with your interpretation of these as agenda and principles. I still don't think people should follow principles that require them to fool their friends without consent, at least implied or tacit. In my personal experience, doing that hasn't turned out well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Morgan/Crunch, I think there's a huge difference between a particular illusionist technique and the "same" participationist technique. Let's say the technique is "add more monsters when the battle isn't exciting enough." The illusionist version requires that the GM hide that she's doing it, and that requires a certain finesse. The participationist version does not require that finesse. Since the players already expect some fudging, the GM can add more monsters in a transparent way, or at least not take pains to hide it.<br/><br/>To me, it's the difference between "walk into the room" and "sneak into the room" in D&amp;D. One requires a stealth roll; the other doesn't.<br/><br/>Are you saying that maybe players in an Illusionist game /don't care/ if the GM cheats (but don't know that he's doing it), so it might as well be the same as Participationism? Because that's a sticky wicket. I think if the players don't care, that's tacit consent and that's Participationism, pure and simple. <br/><br/>If you agree that breaking the social contract is bad (and who doesn't?) and you can see that some people expect the GM not to cheat, then I think it follows that any kind of rule that tells the GM she should cheat and hide it from their friends is problematic. It's a rule that encourages a GM to break the social contract without discussing that aspect of the social contract with the rest of the group, and justifies it with "it's what is best for them" and "they expect it anyway." If it's best for them and they already expect it, then advising a five minute conversation about it seems obvious and wise.<br/><br/><br/>But none of this definition stuff matters all that much except in certain kinds of theoretical discussions, right? It's semantics. What matters is how players feel when stuff happens in a game.

Sometimes "altering for dramatic effect" is very welcome, and improves the game. Other times, it can ruin the game, make a player feel useless/cheated, make the GM feel exhausted and unthanked, or some other undesirable effect. When these "failures" happen, however, the "magician's veil" makes the group incapable of talking about it and fixing it. <br/><br/>So, sooner or later the tool is misapplied, but no one can do anything to fix it. That's when problems start.<br/><br/>Because, of course, you can have all the Illusionism you want, consensual or not, if every time it's used it's done in a way that the group likes and enjoys. That's great! No problems there. But you can't please everyone all of the time, and everyone makes mistakes. The hidden nature of this exercise makes those little blips grow into major problems over time, with no way to spot them or correct them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428098/#Comment_428098" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T02:32:16+00:00" title="February  7, 2014  2:32AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, is this "classic illusionism advice" as the thread title says? <br/><br/>"Feel free to make sure your players know that you<br/>will sometimes \u201ccheat\u201d; honestly, they should expect<br/>it, and they should appreciate that it\u2019s really the only<br/>way you have a chance of giving them any kind of<br/>challenge."<br/><br/>An ungenerous reading (perhaps coupled with baggage and/or an axe to grind) might read it as "Also feel free NOT to make sure -" but the most direct rephrasing would be "Go ahead and make sure your players know-". Or just lose the "feel free" part and say "Make sure your players know that you will sometimes "cheat"". How else are they going to "<i>appreciate it</i>" and "<i>expect it</i>"? Even if " At the very least, you need to carefully conceal your cheats". In other words:<br/><br/>Participationism: GM invalidating player choices with their consent, whether or not they are aware of any instance of it.<br/><br/>"This is hardly a new concept in the annals of<br/>gaming, but it absolutely bears emphasis as the first<br/>rule of running the campaigns being discussed here."<br/><br/>I don't know if the advice is sound for "the campaigns being discussed here" but I assume the author has good reason to include it. If I simply say: "nope, don't like it" then put me down as a tentative "no" to a poll no-one is taking. I can't say that it's "wrong".<br/><br/>So, perhaps the real question is: Is this well-worded advice; as opposed to "the one right way to play" advice ? Personally, I would lose the word "Cheat" immediately. It carries too many negative connotations and sets a bad tone for the rest of it. Let's call it what it really is - GM fiat. There-for, "Rule Number One \u2013 Cheat" should (by definition) be preceded by "Rule 0" (gonna go with TVtropes on this one):<br/><br/>"Rule Zero is simply <b>a reminder to the players</b> that the Game Master has to <b>exercise some common sense</b> and <b>is permitted</b> to supersede the rules <b>when the rules would ruin enjoyment and fair play</b>. While a <b>Game Master has fiat to exercise Rule Zero</b> at their table at will, they are reminded that <b>excessive arbitrary use</b> of this rule will eventually lead to an empty game table."<br/><br/>Read Rule One again and see if you can spot Rule Zero couched within it. Don't like Rule Zero? Perhaps that's a poll for another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428100/#Comment_428100" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T05:36:49+00:00" title="February  7, 2014  5:36AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam_Dray semantics is the study of how we communicate with each other.

You don't like these techniques, so you attempt to hang the breach of social contract on the technique rather than the GM. <br/><br/>Basically, the way you use "illusionism" is just a way for you to tell people that they shouldn't play the game they enjoy.

In an OSR environment that might be the case, but the techniques that we're talking about can actually be used to honor player choices just as easily as invalidating them. Again "invalidating player choices" would be something a GM did with the technique, rather than a necessary result of the technique itself.  The implication that any use of these techniques is invalidating player choice is part of the smear campaign.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428107/#Comment_428107" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T08:50:45+00:00" title="February  7, 2014  8:50AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Nope, sorry.

You can nitpick my definitions all you want, but I've asked you for <i>your</i> definitions and I don't think you've provided them. \n<blockquote>What you're consistently ignoring is that there are plenty of GMs who break the social contract without ever coming anywhere near an illusionist technique. </blockquote>\nI don't think I understand what you're getting at there. Like, my GM could punch me in the face and that'd violate social contract but would not come near an illusionist technique. So what? What does that have to do with this discussion? Why is it relevant, and why is my "ignoring" it a Thing?<br/><br/>What is <i>your stake</i> in this discussion? I think I've put mine on the table: I've played games this way and they went badly. I have an <i>ethical problem</i> with GM-cheating without prior discussion, and I think the cost of that discussion is greatly outweighed by the benefit of openness. \n<blockquote>You want your special swear word for bad GMs who use techniques that you don't like so that you can more easily belittle people who don't play like you, but you don't need it to actually have the discussion. </blockquote>\nDon't need what? The terms illusionist and participationist? The discussion I am having here is about GMs using those techniques only after they've talked about doing so with their players. Illusionism=Not having that discussion. Participationism=Having that discussion. Is that a definition that puts you at ease?<br/><br/>Really, I have no urge to "belittle" anyone. The only name I have mentioned at all is Sean Patrick Fannon (SPF), the author of Shaintar. And I said I'm a big fan (and backed the Kickstarter at a slightly insane level, "Ranger Corporal," which I still need to deliver ideas for):\n<blockquote>Please don't get me wrong. I think the Shaintar setting is fantastic, creative, and fun. I backed the Kickstarter at a high level. I am a fan.</blockquote>\nI haven't belittled you. I haven't sworn at anyone. However, if you're running games using those technique examples and the players don't know, then you're using illusionist techniques. If you're running games using those technique examples and the players DO know (implicitly or explicitly), then you're using participationist techniques.<br/><br/>Or, if you prefer, illusionist-flavored techniques and participationist-flavored techniques. Really, I'm not trying to win a jargon war here. The jargon and definitions were posted to PREVENT this from devolving into a jargon discussion. But this is the Internet, so, you know...\n<blockquote>Because breaking the social contract is the issue, not the techniques used to do so.

Stop it. </blockquote>\nOkay, so let me try to unpack your line of reasoning.<br/><br/>1. I posted a bit of text from the book that advises uses certain techniques.<br/>2. I claim that text advises hiding use of those techniques.<br/>3. The text doesn't actually advise hiding use of those techniques. <br/>4. Which is what I'm calling Participationism.<br/>5. Hiding use of those techniques breaks social contract.<br/>6. Which is what I call Illusionism.<br/>7. A GM who hides the use of those techniques is actually just breaking a social contract.<br/>8. Breaking the social contract is a bad thing.<br/>9. Some people enjoy playing in such a way that the GM hides the use of those techniques.<br/>10. And that's okay. I should stop saying it isn't okay.<br/><br/>Right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428122/#Comment_428122" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T21:41:43+00:00" title="February  7, 2014  9:41PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I think we agree that there are two modes of play, and I think we agree that they're different. I think we agree where the boundary is, and I think you understand what I mean when I use the terms Illusionism and Participationism. <br/><br/>I think you're arguing that there's no need for the terms. There's just a set of techniques, and if you use them one way, you're within social contract, and if you use them another way, you're not in social contract.<br/><br/>That's fine. I will get on board with that, but it's hard to talk about the two modes without <i>terms for them</i>, so I use the I and P terms. That's all.<br/><br/>I do not understand how you can assert #5+#7+#8 AND #9+#10. That doesn't compute for me. If breaking the social contract is bad, then how is it okay if people do it? If breaking the social contract is okay, then how are some people okay with it? Doesn't that imply that it wasn't against their social contract? Doesn't that imply tacit consent for use of those techniques, which implies that it was never outside of social contract to begin with? The logic just falls apart here, unless I've misinterpreted your suppositions.<br/><br/>I would argue that the way I use "Illusionism" is a way for me to tell people that they shouldn't RUN the game that they enjoy unless their players also enjoy playing that way. <br/><br/>See, a player CANNOT know if she's in an Illusionist game, because by definition, the techniques are hidden from her. As soon as she sees the techniques and continues to play, it's Participationism. That's why definitions are important here. By definition, Illusionism requires the GM to hide the /choice/ of techniques from the players. It IS a social contract level problem, but it's executed (as all decisions are) at the technique level.<br/><br/>Option 1: GM doesn't use the techniques. Tells the players she's not using them. Neither Participationism nor Illusionism.<br/>Option 2a: Players tell the GM to use those techniques and the GM uses them. Participationism. <br/>Option 2b: Players tell the GM to use those techniques and the GM doesn't use them. Neither Participationism nor Illusionism.<br/>Option 3a: GM tells the players she's using those techniques and uses them. Participationism. <br/>Option 3b: GM tells the players she's using those techniques and doesn't use them. Neither Participationism nor Illusionism.<br/>Option 4: GM uses the techniques. Doesn't tell the players. Illusionism.<br/><br/>A player can believe she's in a non-P, non-I game but be in an Illusionist game. <br/><br/>A player who believes that certain techniques will not be used, but who has agreed that certain other techniques WILL be used, is in an Illusionist game.<br/><br/>You can further unpack Option 4:<br/><br/>Option 4a: GM uses the techniques. Doesn't tell the players. Illusionism. Players do not find out.<br/>Option 4b: GM uses the techniques. Doesn't tell the players. Illusionism. Players find out and are cool with it.<br/>Option 4c: GM uses the techniques. Doesn't tell the players. Illusionism. Players find out and are not cool with it.<br/><br/>I've participated in all three types of games. There's just no telling when players will find out, and if they'll be cool with or not. So why not have that discussion up front and turn all possibility of 4c into 2a/3a instead? <br/><br/>The argument FOR hiding these techniques from the players generally goes: It'll ruin the magic of the game for them. I disagree that telling the players up front that those kinds of techniques will be used (3a) actually "ruins the magic." You have the discussion, then the players forget it happened, and the GM happily uses the techniques to make the game go a certain way. Everyone has fun. Cool.<br/><br/>But maybe, for some players, even talking about it ruins the magic. The thing is, as a GM, you don't know. So you can avoid the discussion and hope to avoid ruining the magic, and that requires you hide the use of a bunch of techniques that we generally call "cheating." The risk is (4c): players who think that you violated social contract by doing that. I don't think it's worth it. <br/><br/>Personally, I generally fall into (4c) when I figure out I've been in an Illusionist game. I have never flipped a table or punched a GM. At worst, I left a game /after it was over/ with a bad taste in my mouth. Annoyance. However, I've been the GM in games where people got really upset by finding out I was using those techniques. I won't GM that way anymore. <br/><br/>Do I have an agenda? an "axe to grind"? Sure. I don't like Illusionism because I think it's silly. I don't buy that "discussion ruins the magic" trumps "but you could end up cheating in a way that breaks the social contract, and the players won't be cool with that." <br/><br/><br/>Here's a thought experiment. Player "cheating." Illusionism requires GMs to ignore some of the rules of the game to create a better experience for players, and hide all traces of that from the players. Is there a such thing as "Player-Illusionism" in which a player ignores some of the rules of the game to create a better experience for herself or for others? <br/><br/><i>Rolled a 5 instead of a 15, but that sucks, so let's say I rolled a 15. Hell, a 20 is more interesting. Crit! It's not for me and my fighter. It's so the wizard doesn't die. Don't need to tell anyone about it. That would ruin the magic.</i><br/><br/>Is that okay? How does that differ? I understand that the GM operates under different rules, but this situation doesn't seem that different than the GM seeing a player roll a 5 and knowing that the wizard will probably die the next round, so he fudges a bit and has the goblin that the fighter missed run away instead of attack. And doesn't tell anyone, cuz it'd ruin the magic. <br/><br/>That's a player cheating in favor of the players. How about in the other direction?<br/><br/><i>Rolled a 20. That'll kill the goblin in one hit. I'll just say I rolled a 2. It'd be far more interesting if the goblin lives another round so he can seriously injure the wizard.</i><br/><br/>That is similar to the GM adding an extra goblin who attacks the wizard, in service of a better balanced encounter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428127/#Comment_428127" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-08T08:48:36+00:00" title="February  8, 2014  8:48AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to add that I really like the reserve pool of dice in Dogs in the Vineyard that the GM can apply to any NPCs he wants to.

It still exists, it's just lower on the priority list of stuff that a GM does or cares about, below facilitator or neutral ref.<br/><br/><b>The sandbox has edges</b><br/>At the most basic level, this means there needs to be some core player buy-in to the game concept, an awareness of the concept, and some commitment to stick ith the concept. If the players collectively start to go beyond the borders of the sandbox, there needs to be some kind of Tiime Out and assessment procedure and this will inevitably cause tension of some sort, usually a tension with immersionist desires.<br/><br/><b>Particpationism might just plain work better with some kind of discrete block of gaming, like the scenario/module/adventure/arc, with re-assessment and player input between blocks</b><br/><br/>This kinda goes with the last two. Players volunteer to participate and respect the sandbox's edges, just not forever. As an entertainer, the Gm throws what they hope is good, entertaining material together, and the players join in and agree to engage with it. But that material does come to an end, in one fashion or another. The GM runs out of prepped material and/or the players collectively say "we're done with this thing" and abandon that material. The GM needs to then wrap it up, and go on, probably after a real-world play break.<br/><br/>It's during that play break when out-of-character player input is important. Or maybe something like blue-booking. Or the GM throwing out a choice of several other options that they'd consider developing for the next block.<br/><br/><b>If all of this is important to the play style, it probably ought to be somewhere that the players encounter the concept very early on, so they're clear about it.</b><br/>Where exactly? Got me, but it should be front and center in something the players are for sure going to encounter. It may mean rethinking how game texts are written. Maybe it needs to be in a seperate handout. Whatever the case, it strikes me as the sort of thing players need to know and be clear on from step one, long before they dive into something like chargen.<br/><br/><b>This style probably works best with only soft-challenge/soft gamism involved</b><br/>Yes, players still want challenges for the characters and the GM still wants to throw out stuff that challenges them. OTOH, everybody wants to follow the characters and keep them involved and alive for the most part. What does that mean for mechanics exactly? I don't know, but it probably needs to be in there. On the flip side, there still is a desirable tension that every now and again, a character does die or an adventure "block" ends in failure or incomplete success for the player characters.<br/><br/><b>All of this stuff probably pairs best with strong genre or source material emulation</b><br/>Everybody involved needs to be down with that part from the get-go, and have some idea about when they are willing to up-end those expectations and the limits on that. Notably, the rules probably need to be built from the ground up with that sort of thing in mind.<br/><br/>Sorry for the lengthy post. My feeling is that lots and lots of RPGs as played tend to fall into the realm of this stuff. Generally though, it simply hasn't been directly and clearly and openly addressed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428135/#Comment_428135" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-08T12:16:56+00:00" title="February  8, 2014 12:16PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>See, a player CANNOT know if she's in an Illusionist game, because by definition, the techniques are hidden from her.

(They might even find this thread and read about them!)  If the player is voluntarily in a group where that can't be done, or doesn't care to look, or isn't listening when the GM says it, or is very drunk or stupid, then that can hardly be put at the feet of the GM or the designer/writer.<br/>\n<blockquote>Option 3b: GM tells the players she's using those techniques and doesn't use them. Neither Participationism nor Illusionism.</blockquote>\nThis doesn't seem right. Isn't this just as objectionable? "I thought you were going to make these conflicts cool and challenging for us! Instead you just stuck by your garbage preparation that you suck at."<br/>\n<blockquote>The argument FOR hiding these techniques from the players generally goes: It'll ruin the magic of the game for them. I disagree that telling the players up front that those kinds of techniques will be used (3a) actually "ruins the magic." You have the discussion, then the players forget it happened, and the GM happily uses the techniques to make the game go a certain way. Everyone has fun. Cool.</blockquote>\nThe argument I have normally seen is not about hiding the techniques, because that's pointless in a consumerist hobby, where any player can wander on down to the local shop and get a glance at the rules even if the GM hides their books in a safe at the bottom of the ocean, it's more about whether players actually care about this. \n<blockquote>Here's a thought experiment.

is just as "okay" as the GM techniques - that is, if the group is cool with it, then it is fine, and if someone cares about it, they should look into whether it's happening, but if they don't, it's okay if they don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

Ok, there are plotholes, tired tropes, etc...but that's not cheating. It's not like people accuse the writer of The Usual Suspects of cheating by having Kaiser Soze be who he turns out to be at the end...the writer told an incredible story utilizing misdirection and other elements. The story wouldn't have been successful without that. That's the point of the movie, not all the stuff that happens along the way.<br/><br/>'Cheating' in a game atmosphere is only useful if someone is 'coming out ahead' because of the cheating. If the DM is trying to beat the players, except as a story device, then they should put the dice away and break out the Texas Hold'em. One of the fascinating things about roleplaying games to me is that players are really only competing with themselves, and sometimes the game mechanics...but NEVER the DM. The DM writes the screenplay and directs, and the players are his actors with creative input control. The only 'cheating' that can go on is between the agents, accountants, producers, and marketing departments (game designers and mechanics).<br/><br/>As I said, I think the real issue is DMs that aren't experts in their craft yet 'writing or casting themselves into a dead-end', aberrant mechanical probabilities, or players failing to buy into the contract requirements of the game. That's when most DMs find themselves considering a fudge or cheat in order to progress the story. In my opinion the first two can be addressed with practice, education, and forethought. <br/><br/>The third is a particularly nasty issue that's very difficult to deal with, but it HAS to be. Honestly no game should ever begin without unanimous agreement on what kind of game/story is being used/told. If everyone, on both sides of the table, is on board with that vision then the only impetus to 'cheat' should come from weak story elements or fickle mechanics/probability. If anyone breaks their contractual obligation then as hard as it may be all must accept that THEY are the issue, and you can't correct for a participant by 'cheating' story or mechanics. <br/><br/>BTW, I think it's great that there was a crossover between the two groups. That's the sort of thing the internet is amazing for, and I find it really has the potential to impact things in a positive way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431305/#Comment_431305" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T04:00:52+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  4:00AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 5:22AM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that strikes me is that I'm using illusionist techniques when I'm doing collaborative storytelling as a game master by playing games like  <b>This Is Pulp</b> and <b>InSpectres</b>. It doesn't matter what kind of character you got, you will still do the same thing. It doesn't matter what place you will come up with during the prep, it will be the final scene for a fight.<br/><br/>When playing InSpectres, I usually tell the whole (act) structure before we start to play. When playing This Is Pulp, I just say that the things we invent during P.R.E.P. will be used to create an adventure but not how I'm going to use them.<br/><br/>I'm more and more uncertain about categorizing the techniques into participation/illusionism (terms that are good/neutral/bad on a subjective basis), and I wonder instead if this whole discussion is more about the questions if you can cheat in creating a story. That's what <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> asks <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/428122#Comment_428122" rel="nofollow">above</a> (see the last six paragraphs). A player can cheat with the numbers in a competitive way, but what if the player chooses to fail to make a better story?

I find that strange.</blockquote>\nIt <i>is</i> strange when seen from a collaborative viewpoint, which is where I tend to stand these days.  But in my personal experience (we're talking old history here), it arose directly from the perception - nay, the reality - that the GM was a <i>Specialist</i>, an <i>Artist</i>, like an author or a film director, who had a vision bigger than the players' and was creating a magnum opus to be compared with something like the sum total of J.R.R.Tolkien's work.  The players, while participants in the day-to-day events of this world, were also sort of like audience members, <i>visitors</i> to the GM's personal world.  In a prepped-sandbox world where an obsessive GM does hundreds of hours of work for every hour put in by the players, it makes a certain type of sense.<br/><br/>But I've never written railroads.  My players always retained the possibility of surprising me, I enjoy that.  In practice, my most frequent "cheat" was to re-roll when I didn't like the wandering monster or Reaction Roll I got for an NPC.  I saw such "cheating" as "protecting the mood and feel of the world" basically.  Another frequent reason for "cheating" was to save PCs from dying early in the session, or in some dramatically unsatisfying way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431339/#Comment_431339" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T11:44:20+00:00" title="April 20, 2014 11:44AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Troy, that's a good article, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431341/#Comment_431341" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T13:44:46+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  1:44PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Troy">@Troy</a> - I enjoyed the article but I think there's a clarification needed on your end statement. Classical RPG methods (ie DM writes the story, players operate within it) should be avoided IF your group doesn't enjoy those classical RPG methods.<br/><br/>See, there's absolutely nothing objectively bad about that style of gaming. For millions of people, it's actually very much the POINT of gaming. It's just that for many others (perhaps as many or more than the classical stylists even, I don't know of any hard data on it) it doesn't work as well. For those that don't enjoy it, it's vitally important to be aware of it and avoid it. <br/><br/>Even for those that do enjoy the old school methods I would agree that it's better if they're fully aware of what's actually going on. Since it's usually very clearly spelled out in the printed materials of those games, that shouldn't be a problem. However when a GM/DM reaches a certain skill level they really can become master craftsman of the narrative, effectively hiding the 'behind stage' work that necessarily constrains the story. <br/><br/>Further, it isn't that the phrase you focus on is nonsensical. It's that you either fail to understand it, or disagree with it or the warrants upon which it is based. <br/><br/>Let's return to my Hollywood metaphor for a moment.<br/><br/>When the actors and director show up on set there's an overall plan for the story they're going to make. They have some rough idea of their characters, the different scenes, and even the dialogue. Now many producers and directors are open to creative input from the actors, allowing the movie to change a bit, sometimes into something very different than originally imagined. There's a constant flow of rewriting, sub-plot introduction, and character evolution. However, they still tell the same basic story they set out to. They have to, or the movie could never get made...it would just be filmed random improv. After all, you need sets, props, special effects, permits, and the capital to make that all happen. So basically this is how a movie gets made: A writer/producer (who may also be the director) makes the story, and the actors decide the nuance of how their characters maneuver through the story and interact with the intended audience.<br/><br/>Gaming, in the classical style, is no different. Someone (either the GM, or a 3rd party module designer) makes a story, and the players decide how they will portray the various roles and make it entertaining for the entire group within the context of that story. It's not nonsensical, it's the definition of the thing, in order to accomplish a certain style of play.<br/><br/>Now, that's not to say that it's the only style of play, or a superior one. It's not. There are games that work in a near total sandbox, and players who prefer that style. We cannot, however, make a normative judgement one way or the other. Instead we need to be aware of bias, and our warrants, and choose accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431343/#Comment_431343" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T15:40:09+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  3:40PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 3:43PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A whole facebook thread that can still be summed up as:<br/><br/>"The information about what GMs do in this game is easily accessible to anyone who wants to know.

Additionally, I talked with him and others in the public thread. Without going into the personal details, I want to say that Sean intended the rules passage I quoted to apply specifically to balancing encounters in the tough environment of "Legends" play, and not as general advice. He publicly stated that he has regrets about the technique where you fudge a die roll and says he doesn't really do that at his table. He also feels that everyone he encounters in his games assumes that GMs fudge, so it never occurred to him that anyone would think of it as cheating. In Sean's circles, fudging for the good of the game is a tradition, perhaps the only tradition, and perhaps an unspoken tradition. We had some interesting discussions about whose responsibility it is to raise these issues; that is a candidate for a new thread, perhaps.<br/><br/>I believe that Savage Worlds in general, and Shaintar specifically, promote a kind of play that is unlikely to see many "challenge-based" / Step On Up / gamist types of players, so any of the potential agenda class problems this thread raised are probably not going to happen. The average Savage Worlds player probably expects the GM to fudge. Note that the core rules are built around the "bennies" mechanism, which is basically open, codified "fudging" of a sort. While this alone isn't rules license to fudge without using bennies, the spirit of the game probably includes the idea of "trust the GM to do whatever, even fudge, to make the story better." <br/><br/>From my couple hours of private discussion, I can tell that Sean is a fantastic person, a GM who cares intensely about the quality of the games he sells and the games he GMs, and a man who is extremely passionate about all of this stuff. I regret that my cavalier discussion of his work stressed him out, but it did lead to some very interesting discussion. I remain a true fan of his work, and now, of him as a human being.<br/><br/>If people want to discuss these topics further, can we please start new threads?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431442/#Comment_431442" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-22T06:56:25+00:00" title="April 22, 2014  6:56AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm down with this suggestion.
