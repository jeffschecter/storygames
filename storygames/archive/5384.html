It was a rollicking good time.  I had half the Durham 3 (Jason and Clinton) in town on business, and invited my friend Davey over to round out the crew. I wasn't as well-versed rulewise in Agon as I thought I was, and this was a detriment. Totally my fault, totally fixable. It did hold things up though, and I felt bad, but we worked through it and that's no fault of the game or the setting. <br/><br/>John Harper had made us these <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2008/01/dagon.html" rel="nofollow">AMAZING character sheets</a>, so we were off to a good start: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Dave told me to go crazy with the DAGON character sheet, so I did.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/agon/dagon_sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.onesevendesign.com/agon/dagon_sheet.gif"/></a><br/><br/>Click the image to download the PDF.</blockquote>\nClinton played Olivieros, an NSA-based rifle user who took out minions like nobody's business. Trait: Mankiller<br/>Jason played Berkowitz, a CIA tradecraft-and-shotguns operative who sacrificed himself to save the others. Trait: Culthunter<br/>Davey played Wilkinson, an FBI Analyst with a taste for Dark Lore and a shotgun to back it up. Trait: Clear-eyed.<br/><br/>I sent them to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru" rel="nofollow">Nauru</a>, where contact had been lost with a recent excavation underneath the pinnacle substrate. They waded ashore, crept through jungle and pinnacles to the dig site, and managed to get down into the dig without too much trouble. But there, in the excavated temple, was the giant frog-shaped hole in the wall leading into infinite darkness. This eternally dark hole attacked sanity, and threatened to drive Berkowitz and Wilkinson over the edge until Olivares fired a bright tracer round into it, shattering their trance and bringing them back just in time to face the first wave of Tsothoggua's slimy psuedohuman minions. This battle was tough, but at the time we were still playing with some wrong rules, so that's my fault. After they dispatched the last of the frog-men, they headed to town. A mob of townsfolk confronted them, but a shootout in the street convinced the rest of the islanders that they were safer in their homes, and our heroes took over a tavern for some interludes, including calling back to their home agencies for help, and competing in contests of shotgun prowess with the bottles behind the bar.   Then, they headed to the detention center, where it was clear Tsothoggua was not going to go without a fight. Berkowitz lined the building with detcord and they burst into the auditorium amid the deafening croaking of otherworldy transformed men. Things did not go well:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>INT DETENTION CENTER, NAURU<br/><br/>LONG SHOT through the auditorium doors.  We see WILKINSON, OLIVIEROS, and BERKOWITZ silhouetted, with several MINIONS between them and the horrible, bloated form of TSOTHOGGUA.  OLIVIEROS is a machine, hanging back and putting rounds into the Big Bad with his modified SIG-550.  WILKINSON and BERKOWITZ have shotguns and are keeping the MINIONS off him, getting badly hurt in the process.  BERKOWITZ has a wild look.  He drops his shotgun, draws a pistol.  The detonator for the C-4 is in his left hand.<br/><br/>OLIVIEROS:  Don't do it, Berkowitz!<br/><br/>CLOSE UP on BERKOWITZ as he gazes into TSOTHOGGUA'S eyes.  He is knocked down by a MINION'S claws.<br/><br/>WILKINSON:  Ethan!<br/><br/>TSOTHOGGUA's horrible tongue lashes out, wraps around BERKOWITZ and lifts him into the monster's maw.  He makes a whimpering sound.  We see him jam down the trigger.  SMASH CUT to the det cord initiating.<br/><br/>OLIVIEROS:  Wilkinson, 30 seconds!<br/><br/>WILKINSON breaks and runs, dropping her shotgun.  OLIVIEROS swears and covers her retreat.  His features harden.  He's made his choice.<br/><br/>OLIVIEROS:  All right, come on then!<br/><br/>OLIVIEROS walks, firing, toward TSOTHOGGUA.</blockquote>\nIn the end, only Wilkinson survived to make it to the extraction point and call in the airstrike. But, as there was only one slot for promotion within the Delta Green group, the government was entirely satisfied with this outcome.

I've thinking about running an Agon / Call of Cthulhu game (Cthulagon!), probably because I've been playing entirely too much Arkham Horror.<br/><br/>I hadn't worked out all the details, but my plan was to actually rejigger Fate, shorten it and use it as a Sanity trait. After all there's only so much one investigator can take, and then it's out to la la land. Get in too deep and you have to burn Sanity to save yourself (via all the normal Fate expenditures): even if you are lucky enough to survive the horror stays with you, unspeakable things you can't forget, etc.<br/><br/>"God oaths" won from successful adventures become familiarity with the Old Ones you can use to get out of pinches ("I've using my Hastur d12 from the terrible things I learned on the blasted heath..."). Naturally this presumes anyone survives an adventure.<br/><br/>The one part that doesn't seem to fit is the whole competitive glory aspect -- the investigators are on the same side, and while you could include a sort of "I don't have to outrun the bear" competitiveness it doesn't seem to fit the bill.<br/><br/>How did glory/competitiveness work out in the D.A.G.O.N. game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120913/#Comment_120913" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T06:50:35+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  6:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We were way overmatched, so the competitive aspect rapidly took a back seat to mutual support in order to survive.

That game might be a better starting point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209276/#Comment_209276" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T11:56:06+00:00" title="May 27, 2009 11:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This loooks very interesting.<br/>\nAre the tweaked rules on the net anywhere?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209280/#Comment_209280" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T12:30:37+00:00" title="May 27, 2009 12:30PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sadly no. My notes are somewhere in some notebook. But most of the changes are cosmetic - use the Dagon sheet, substitute in some agencies in place of demigods, change ability names per the character sheet, and make some gear to replace the swords, spears, and armor of the original game.  Also see the notes in this thread, like fate=sanity. That should get you most of the way there.
