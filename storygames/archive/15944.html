Lawful Evil GMs Paul Hughes and I will also be running Dwimmermount sessions at the Brooklyn Strategist, so that backdrop will provide some context against which the lawful evil party's actions can resonate.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if you want to play, and even if not I hope you'll come and check it out!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian says:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I\u2019m looking for some D&amp;D; players for an event in a gallery on three days in March. It\u2019s a re-enactment of \u201cLawful Evil,\u201d a work by artist Brody Condon in which participants play D&amp;D; using a party of LE characters.  The dates are 3/15, 3/17 and 3/24, and the location is 319 Scholes, located in Brooklyn between the Grand St and Montrose St stops on the L train. Here are a few things to consider if you\u2019re interested in playing:<br/>\n<br/>\n- You have to be willing to play in a public space and ignore distractions. Players should not engage in conversation with visitors to the gallery; it would interrupt gameplay and erase the barrier between the work and the audience (which is already precariously thin in this piece). Ignoring distractions will be toughest on opening night, when the gallery will be crowded. I anticipate fairly light traffic on the other two days.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You should be willing to role-play. Players are not expected to \u201cperform\u201d their characters, but are expected to keep in mind that the title of the work is \u201cLawful Evil.\u201d Players must make in-game decisions in character according to the definition of the LE alignment.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If you usually play a very recent or very old edition of D&amp;D; in which \u201clawful evil\u201d is not a standard alignment, you should bone up on how it is defined in editions from AD&amp;D; to 3.5/Pathfinder. Pre-generated characters will be provided.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If you\u2019d like to take part but can\u2019t commit to the entire time, let me know. I can try to set up shifts.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Pencils, scratch paper, and a limited quantity of dice will be provided. - Snacks will be provided. Players are invited to put in advance requests for their favorites.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe specific dates/times are:<br/>\nThursday, March 15, 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.<br/>\nSaturday, March 17, 12 p.m. to 6 p.m.<br/>\nSaturday March 24, 12 p.m. to 6 p.m.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for considering!</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
