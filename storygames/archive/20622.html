I say soft-cancelled because I said I couldn't host, knowing that would inevitably lead to it not happening for a variety of reasons. To be honest, I'm just feeling anxious and disconnected and not wanting to be around people, but I also do miss the game, which has been going really well so far. We usually get together on Saturdays too (well, an overlapping but not identical set of people) and play board games. If I'm not feeling the same at that time, I may propose we try out InSpectres or something one-shotty.<br/><br/>Did you make up a new oracle for the setting?

The three big propositions on the table are playtest for my own project, a full campaign of <i>Ars Magica</i>, and a new, fresh old school D&amp;D sandbox.

I use the boardgaming as a hiring system for rpgs (easier to get people to join in boardgames, generally speaking, and they allow me to test the mettle of prospective roleplayers), alongside enjoying it for its own sake.<br/><br/>The current set-up originated last year: I was still living in Helsinki, but I came to Upper Savo for six weeks to do some seasonal forestry in the fall, which gave me an opportunity to strike. I asked my teenaged nephew (he's like 14 years old this year maybe?) to get some of his friends together for a bit of boardgaming then. I conducted a couple boardgaming nights with them, taught some games and table etiquette, and left them with instructions to continue playing weekly over the winter.<br/><br/>When I came back in the spring, they'd been fumbling along with boardgames, but hadn't developed the social capital much, so I took to it again. I moved the meetings to Fridays at my sister's restaurant, as Fridays have been much too quiet there lately, and asked my gaming friends (the few who still live here - I've been away for three years, and Upper Savo is the kind of area where people come from, not where they go to) to join in. I also prepared to invite in any interested customers; the clientele of the restaurant runs a gamut from alcoholics to families, so you never know who might show up, and what they might like.<br/><br/>Last Friday we had three children courtesy of my nephew, one of my old gaming friends and one other person, I think - six in total. This Friday the gamers will probably show up in greater force (2-4 maybe?), and I expect about five-ish children; would make the arrangements easier if I could split the children and the adults into their own tables. We'll see how it goes.<br/><br/>But no, I haven't done any particular advertising on this yet, as I've just started doing it actively again. I will maybe put up some posters or something at the local high school and so on sooner or later. Then again, summer holidays are starting, and I don't actually need that large of a crew for now. Perhaps next fall, when the schools start, I'll see about starting to develop the ranks and quality with an eye towards games like <i>Diplomacy</i> and such.<br/><br/>Regarding the bar thing, although in this case I have a personal in on the space thanks to my sister owning the place, I haven't found it difficult to make similar arrangements with other restaurants or bars, either. Most of them around here are happy enough with boardgamers wanting to play there - they strive to be public rooms, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452479/#Comment_452479" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-21T20:31:49+00:00" title="April 21, 2016  8:31PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really cool, Eero, thanks!

It could have lasted longer \u2014 what with a couple new-characters recently introduced via "ungiven future" advancements \u2014 but we had to wrap it up today because one of the players is about to move out of the country. It was a very long session, as we met at 4 pm and played until 2 am, with a dinner break. There were still a few loose ends, but not a lot, so we're ultimately satisfied with how it turned out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452601/#Comment_452601" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-24T02:37:43+00:00" title="April 24, 2016  2:37AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            10-hour session!

I've been running it with a semi-revolving group who are either completely new to RPGs or returning after 10+ year hiatuses (hiati? :P). At first everyone was focused entirely on the score and being professional. Then the session before last, the lurk decided to gather info on the slide during downtime - just as the slide over-indulged and bragged about the crew's last score! After the slide walked into the secret lair, high and with floosy in-tow a very exciting confrontation ensued - the result was the slide paying 1 coin to the group and getting a Ghost Pact never to blab about the crew again, while the Lurk left duskvol for a while with one of the rooks. <br/><br/>During this session's downtime the spider responsible for the Ghost Pact needed a coin. The slide offered him one, but then said actually he'd only do it in exchange for removing the pact. The slide's player is very new to RPGs - we all thought he just didn't understand that the Pact couldn't hurt him unless he let it, but it seemed like a fair enough deal so it went ahead. Then the slide asks, "Do I need to use a downtime action to go tell the billhooks where our secret liar is?" Brilliant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452866/#Comment_452866" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-02T18:32:07+00:00" title="May  2, 2016  6:32PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The Microscope novice at the table started out by saying "so, what's the combat system?" and ended by saying saying, "wow, this is great, we made so much in two hours."</blockquote>\nGlorious.

We did a standard post-apocalyptic setting but made it on a mountain. Cool things discovered were a creepy radio tower, a legendary lake monster, and purple ore. The three of us had a blast although we sort of rushed the ending... boy that game takes a long time. I think I very much prefer the shorter version where you play fewer cards per season.<br/><br/><b>The Burning Wheel </b> is my only IRL game. We wrapped up a completed Night Witches campaign and a player was very excited to do a Town Watch campaign drawing heavily from Deadwood and The Wire. We spoke about a system. Originally this was gonna be D&amp;D 5e, but I let him borrow a copy of Burning Wheel Gold to look over and fell in love with it at once. So far we've only burned characters. I'll be playing an exiled, one-eye'd elf. I'm drawing a lot of inspiration from Detective Lester Freamon from The Wire. Troubled and eccentric, but has been in this town for a long time and knows it well. He's natural police. <br/><br/><b>Night Witches</b> starting from Duty Station 1 online. As the GM I'm taking the game in a direction that involves things that I didn't focus a lot on during my previous campaign of Night Witches. I'm looking more at rationing free time as well as the politics of the chain of command. It's been very fun! But also very dark and rough. 2/3 of the players characters did not make it to Duty Station 2. Let this be a lesson about taking regard for your plane and you crashing it!<br/><br/><b>Blades in the Dark</b> for players all brand new to Blades. We settled on the Vigilante crew-type by Sean Nittner! Because this campaign is has a limited number of sessions, we spent a lot of time in character creation talking about what our goals will be for this campaign! We've settled on tackling some of the corruption in the city and, in particular, taking down the Circle of Flame who are a bunch of nefarious artifact collectors. I love the name my players came up with: CLOAK &amp; GAVEL.<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D 5e: Winters Edge</b> A good friend of mine is running a 5e campaign about colonization/frontiers set in the thawing north. I'm playing a Warlock with the patron of a neutral grim reaper like demigod. It's fun learning why I got my power and why this demigod has chosen me and how it's affecting my relationships with my party members and our colony! This is not a very traditional D&amp;D experience. Because we're playing online and each episode is streamed, a lot has been modified: The GM has combined a lot of the Kingdom management rules from Pathfinder into this game and the GM is coordinating with the audience concerning NPCs, and "tavern roleplay" like sessions keeping the world dynamic and interactive for EVERYONE. Super cool.<br/><br/>Upcoming games that I'm also super excited about are: <b>Blades Against Darkness</b> which is a hack of Blades in the Dark inspired by Robert E Howard. With Once Upon A Game returning, you can also expect to see this month: <b>Fiasco</b>, <b>The Skeletons</b> and <b>Shock</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452902/#Comment_452902" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T18:39:25+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  6:39PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another session of my Pathfinder game where I'm playing my "Julia," an efrit bard 5/swashbuckler 3 played up from 1st level for the last year or so, based on Julie d'Aubigny. <br/><br/>Her moral character is being tested (proved). They're delving underground to understand more and eventually tackle "The Thing That Devours." To learn more, they had to strike a devil's bargain with an ancient derro wizard. This involved giving the wizard blood, spit, skin, fingernails, hair, and so on--components which will the wizard will ultimately use to make a tiny homunculus of Julia, who will certainly be subjected to all kinds of torture in the wizard's people-ant-farm.<br/><br/>Anyway, she learned that The Thing That Devours is some kind of banished elder god and that, as it devours parts of the bodies of the hobgoblins who live down here, it gains control over them.<br/><br/>There a weird moment when Joe, playing an allegedly Lawful Good cleric, kept going on about how we should sacrifice the three hobgoblin NPCs who were helping us to the elder god, and I asked Joe, "What's your character's alignment?" with a certain amount of incredulity. Later, when he kept doing that, the GM asked the same thing. The table generally agreed that he wasn't playing LG. Especially the player of the dwarf, who is chaotic neutral. My hope is that the group doesn't fight about alignment as players, but I welcome intraparty bickering about the moral course of action.<br/><br/>Julia also argued that we didn't have to be the heroes that save the world alone--especially if it looks like we have to do terrible, evil things to accomplish it "alone." She suggested that we could go to the local monarch and enlist help, because she suspected that monarchs listen when you talk about waking up elder gods who want to devour everything.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452907/#Comment_452907" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T19:46:21+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  7:46PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a>, glad to see another person who has made a Pathfinder bard based on Julie d'Aubigny! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (Mine was swashbuckler archetype bard; I think I took Perform: Action Movie Quip as one of my skills. On the other hand, she was Neutral Evil and so had fewer moral quandaries.)<br/><br/>Also, your cleric Joe sounds very much like a Joe I played with who also liked allegedly Lawful Good clerics and paladins...you aren't near Columbus Ohio, are you? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Tonight should be my last GMing session of Night Witches; I expect to close out Duty Station 5 and then bring back Captain Vera for the end of the war. In my GM runs I've done a lot of experimenting with the politruks, because you can have fun playing against type. The three I used:<br/><br/>1) Captain Nadezhda Toropova, a twenty-something woman whom I described as a "Komsomol camp counselor in way over her head." (Her motto would have been something like "Our goal is Socialism, our weapon is Education!") She was naive and ended profoundly disillusioned.<br/><br/>2) Senior Lieutenant Olga, Nadia's assistant. She was Bolshevik before there were Bolsheviks--she and her husband had been sent to the camps by the <i>Tsar</i> after the 1905 Revolution, and she was proud to have disowned her emigre son. She tried to convince one PC to join SMERSH among other horrible things (including making said PC pull the trigger in a mock execution that only Olga knew was mock.)<br/><br/>3) Senior Lieutenant Pilar Ililichyna Strelkova i Rodrigues, the current zampolit. She's half Spanish and witnessed the fall of the Republic first hand, which has made her a strict believer in doctrine and discipline. Things have not gone well with the PCs under her...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What did you play this week?

But the DM didn't show. So I pulled out Dungeons of Fate and Fate Accelerated an ran a quick impromptu dungeon adventure, followed by one of my friends running the "Red Packet Rumble" for Feng Shui 2.<br/><br/>Both of these games had new adherents by the end of the session. Other than my friends, there was a father-and-son in the Dungeons of Fate game; he said that he ran RIFTS at home for his son but didn't really like the system. By the end of the game, he grabbed a box of Fate dice from the store and had ordered Fate Accelerated to play at home. And a friend that dropped in on the Feng Shui session said it was the best RPG he ever played and we are looking at starting a weeknight "small press RPG"* thing at the store soon!<br/><br/>* - Small press meaning not WotC in this context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453081/#Comment_453081" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T04:50:31+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  4:50AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This past week, I played the "prep for 1940 Dracula Dossier by obsessively working with my notes" and realized I was as prepped as can be before this week's character creation session. I also played the "edit the Delta Green scenario I played in at GenCon and go 'Oh, that's what was going on!'" game, and Saturday, the real life larp "our apartment is getting everyone's backed up sh*t?!" which, fortunately, ended well, thanks to the superintendent, although the sequel game involved a fair bit of cleaning and bleach. Oh, and somewhere in there, I fit prepping to playtest one of the new Gumshoe Confidential single player and GM scenarios, or at least the "reading the scenario" step. Rereading the rules would help.<br/><br/>Tomorrow, we might be playing Diaspora, wherein my PC will continue to throw up his hands and try to keep human civilization from self destructing and wonder why he is bothering.

Richard wanted to forget his wife and his life. Wayne wanted to escape the lie he was living. Jessie didn't really want to go, but wanted to prove to herself and her parents that she was free and a grown-up. Popcorn wanted to find herself.<br/><br/>In the end, they all had to come to terms with who they were and how things were and they couldn't change things by going on a trip to Rio. But they managed to get some new perspectives and all, in their own ways, managed to let go.<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-9tpkxKZS4fc?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tpkxKZS4fc"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/9tpkxKZS4fc/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453371/#Comment_453371" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-19T05:34:44+00:00" title="May 19, 2016  5:34AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went to Camp Nerdly, so I got to play a bunch of stuff!<br/><br/><b>The New World</b> -- clash of characters at a meeting of cultures between natives, newcomers, and outsiders.

We were one player short of Pandemic Legacy so we just jumped into chargen and the intro adventure of Curse of Strahd.<br/>Party got eaten by wolves and died. GREAT SESSION!!!!<br/>Got compliments from the group, feeling really good about RPGs again. The insp was flying, the flashlights were falling. Lots of RP, lots of ten-foot-pole pokery, lots of very dungeon worldy fights, the best from my players yet with shoving and using the environment and describing their actions in a varied and creative way. I've ran the real DW with a party that was just "I transform into a bear again" every combat (when I played it I made a point of being as many different weird and useless animals as possible).<br/>So DW itself isn't panacea. But here they made great use of the environment, earning advantage etc. I've described this as a great strength of 5e but one that has come out more at con games than my home game. But tonight was the night apparently! So great. All credit to my wonderful group who really brought their best to bring it alive.<br/><br/>So amazing. Is there a spoiler block on S-G?

But one player made a choice that was very clearly... destructive for all of us, and in a way that affects the rest of the campaign going forward. I... could've handled it better, I got passive aggressive, making jokes, and also trying to take deep breaths but I was visibly upset. I mean... it's such a small thing. Who cares if we win or lose this campaign. I just get really invested. [He made it so that one of the characters became pretty much unusable for the rest of the campaign in a situation where he could've gotten away with a very minor scar.]<br/><br/>We should've stopped him, paid more attention and I think that that was the problem. We have three nerds around the board doing like topology analysis of viral pathways and statistics calculation on the infection rate and this guy he's still asking basic rules questions. I've got to learn to be more patient and supportive. He is my friend.\u2665<br/>He ain't heavy, he's my co-player!<br/><br/>I behaved really badly tonight.

We didn't get much done in the 1st session last week - chargen was a little more fiddly than I expected, having gotten used to comparatively chill PbtA games like the Warren lately, and the kids spent a lot of time picking their initial hideout upgrades. <br/><br/>This week's session was fantastic though! We're playing through the quickstart setup, with the Clockwork Falcons (our protagonists) having taken a job to burglarize the headquarters (and sword-fighting school!) of the Red Sash gang. Things went splendidly haywire, abetted by each of the kids' attempts to shoehorn in special abilities - like, they wanted to use their special powers so bad that they didn't care how non-applicable they were to the situation at hand. Fun!<br/><br/>I'm also really liking how Blades sits kind of at the mechanical intersection of PbtA and Burning Wheel. Fiction in-fiction out play + negotiated approach, difficulty, and stakes = big fun and really surprising outcomes! Wishing now that I'd shelled out for book during the Blades kickstarter, rather than just the pdf.<br/><br/>Then, <b>tonight</b>, I get to play <b>Apocalypse World</b> for the first time in like 4 years. Going to use the 2nd Edition playbooks and revised moves. And I actually get to play rather than MC! I'm thinking of going with the Child-Thing playbook, but the Water Bearer is also looking pretty hot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453598/#Comment_453598" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-27T22:20:54+00:00" title="May 27, 2016 10:20PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2016 10:21PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/49871513/" rel="nofollow">House of Reeds</a> at Story Games Seattle.

So when the rest of us were early, we whipped out CoS and played for an hour. Still no fights. And... well, I'm super happy with the session and I think we're at rocket fuel town it's so good, but... we have this one player who really wants to engage with the fighting mechanics (was the feedback last time). And since we didn't this time... it was all talking scenes, investigating, exploring...<br/>Since they were in a city, there were no random encounter rules either.<br/><small><i>Edit:</i> This time around, I got very nice feedback and compliments from that player! Makes me feel great</small><br/><br/><br/>So this was literally a "not a single die roll was made" session. Now, Adam Koebel said on YouTube that he hates that, he hates bothering with a game if the mechanics aren't helping you... but... the mechanics <em>are</em> helping me, except that they are "invisible". The mechanics that came into this game was A. Prep (mechanic: "read the module") and B. Petitioner/Granter from DramaSystem/Unframed. I used the heck out of this with very satisfying results.<br/><br/><br/>Then the fourth <b>Pandemic Legacy</b> player showed up and we played two missions, early and late August (we won late August). Both games were much faster than normal. We typically take a little more for half an hour and teardown (and this doesn't scale, we take this long for every game even in a marathon session) and an hour for the actual game part. This time, the setup/teardown took as long as normal but the games were much shorter. The first we died really quickly. And the other we won really quickly.<br/><br/><br/>Pandemic Legacy is satisfying mechanically (interesting combo building, maths etc) but I'm very disappointed in the story. So it's the opposite to CoS for me right now, where I love how the players are picking sides and starting fights in the various villages of Barovia but we have a dearth of player-visible mechanics.<small>(<i>Edit:</i> Which turned out to be fine after all.

Overall went pretty well. We didn't define the killer as well as we should have, and that led to some bizarre tonal discord and a story that didn't hang together super well, thematically or logically. We also had 7 players, and it is generally my experience that larger groups will almost always have that kind of issue. But some fun scenes and characters. Our story was about a group of people in a mine that had been converted into a fallout shelter just after nuclear war apparently broke out. Supernatural weirdness in the mine (or possibly the mine itself?), taking (mostly) the form of a weird little girl, killed everyone except Jeremy the gentle widower, who in the climax hammered the child in the face and crawled out of the shelter into an ambiguously quiet forest. I was kinda pulling for Antoine, the bodyguard and lover of the older lady whose family had owned the mine, but despite his probably appearing in the most scenes/having the most relationships, he drowned in what seemed to be a literal underground lake of self-doubt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453732/#Comment_453732" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-03T23:11:47+00:00" title="June  3, 2016 11:11PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First half of the final boss battle in our formerly Pathfinder, now Dungeon World run through The Rise of the Runelords adventure path.

One person in the group reads the big one, the rest just can read the summary and you gan use the summary as like an unimposing overview.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453765/#Comment_453765" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-07T22:55:34+00:00" title="June  7, 2016 10:55PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got together with Marc and Caroline Hobbs (of Downfall fame) for a barrage of playtesting.<br/><br/>In Marc's game <b>Eden</b>, we learned that bitey little spiders may make bad role-models, but turtles give the <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/770/hide-in-your-own-body/" rel="nofollow">worst advice ever</a>. Later we took a new game Caroline's been working on, <b>Entanglement</b>, for a spin. So much difficult romance, so much anime fandom. Vampire-anime fans are brooding, and werewolf-anime fans are intense, but no one understands harpy-anime fans. At all.<br/><br/>We played <b><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/category/dev/follow/" rel="nofollow">Follow</a></b> and defied my prediction that *no one* would ever want to try the quest where you play doctors curing a disease and argue about ethics and clinical testing. We did and it was fantastic! So\u2026 unexpected achievement unlocked.<br/><br/>I also played another game of <b>Follow</b> at the Story Games Seattle playtest meetup. Our superheroes tried to get past old grudges and form a team, but our faint hopes went out the window when the 42 year-old career-sidekick's (ordinary) daughter got killed trying to save us from a supervillain. The sidekick was our one voice of unity and optimism and he lost it, naturally.<br/><br/>And then we kind of nuked part of the city.

I started Red Packet Rumble last week with two players; this time 4 showed up, making the combat a bit more complicated. This time letting the player get away with having their car in the scene worked against them, since the bad guys does as much damage as the more powerful player attack +1.<br/><br/>And the awakened Dragon has a power that does the enemy's damage +1. So that fight escalated quickly, and the Awekened Dragon was pretty beat up by the end of the ordeal.<br/><br/>Since we finished early, and I was excited to play with my new toys, I ran a quick <b>Fate Accelerated</b> scenario using <b>It's Not My Fault</b>.<br/><br/>It was amusing. I mostly banked on D&amp;D tropes, but when I run it again, I may keep different inspirations in the back of my mind.<br/><br/>We had an Illusionist Con Artist, a Sharpshooter Sorcerer, a Pirate Assassin, and a Barbarian Merchant Performer. Most memorable moments: The Barbarian player did his best Arnie impression hocking wares, and the Sorcerer Sharpshooter played off his area-effect blast as a stream of target-seeknig bullets from his gun a la Zorg's demonstration for the Mangalores in The Fifth Element.

I needed an ongoing game that I could run in a two-hour slot every other week at a cool bar in Baltimore, with the stipulation that players could drop in and play with zero commitment beyond one session. When I asked about D&amp;D stuff that wasn't all murderhoboist, Daniel Levine pointed me at a blog post about adapting West Marches style sandbox play to community-based urban D&amp;D play. So I threw together my City of Brass.<br/><br/>The PCs are squatters in a collapsing building complex in the worst neighborhood in the city. There are concentric rings of oppression surrounding them, ranging from systemic racism and other bigotry to gang violence to religious zealotry. I am working on a handful of minigame systems to hammer home the oppression.<br/><br/>Main things right now:<br/><br/>* Everyone starts with 6 gp.<br/><br/>* Everyone has a reason to be in the commune and a reason why they can't just leave.<br/><br/>* Everyone has a profession, something they can try to do to make a living.<br/><br/>* They live at a poor level, and have to pay 1 sp / day to eat and avoid exhaustion. Per game day, I ask them what they eat, and make them spend 1 sp if they don't have another food source.<br/><br/>* The building they're squatting in is a wreck, and basically makes everything harder (disadvantage on most rolls). Even getting rest there is hard.<br/><br/>* The commune as-a-group has five stats based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. These have low ratings right now, but can be improved through adventures.<br/><br/>* Once per session, everyone makes a Morale (Wisdom/Insight) check at easy (10) difficulty. Failure means the person must choose one of the five commune stats to lower. "You're bringing the commune down, man."<br/><br/>I have a random 2d12 table of oppression-based plot hooks. Mostly, these things affect the entire commune, not a single PC. I had the group roll up three of these at the start of play. I wrote each on an index card. They chose what to tackle and how to go about it. <br/><br/>I figure that solving these problems is the reward mechanism for leveling up. Whenever you take part in the solution of a problem, earn a point. Hard problems might be worth 2 or 3 points. Earn 3 points per level to advance (3 to level to 2nd, 6 to level to 3rd, etc.).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453834/#Comment_453834" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-13T16:38:23+00:00" title="June 13, 2016  4:38PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Our <i>Warren </i>game continues.

And I agree about subverting things time to time. When I rotated into the GMs chair the first time around in our <i>Night Witches</i> game, I decided to play against our so-far crapsack world where everyone was out to get the PCs--so I gave them a new Chief of Staff who was willing to fight to protect her pilots and give them what they needed.

My dystopian rollerblading RPG, <b>Sun Stealers X-treme</b>, worked pretty much as hoped - lots of wild technology and epic tricks were pulled as we skated past The Corporation's defenses to steal back the sunshine. Said playtesting may have contributed to my staying up until nearly dawn to actually finish my Game Chef submission, but that was a small price to pay.<br/><br/>Then on Sunday, only mildly zombified from my near-all-nighter, I played in the first session of a <b>Dungeon Crawl Classics</b> game with a group of folks I'd never played with before. The flavor was established early on as "dungeon juvenilia" - frex, the party's goblin thief has a strict rule about only dating goats - which is fine, but I hope it doesn't become the dominant mode of play. I want to not always be silly, you know.<br/><br/>GM for the new group also dropped the 0-level funnel - unfortunate, as that was one of the main features of DCCRPG that piqued my interest. We didn't get to really see any of the other funny mechanics in play - the elf didn't have any sufficiently crap spellcasting rolls to invoke the corruption/magical misfire rules, and the only character who rolled a fumble was an NPC pet. All in all it felt a lot like the D&amp;D3.5 games I played when I was in my 20s. It was pretty fun, but I'm not sure how long I'll stick around in that game. My gaming dance card is quite full of other interesting stuff (like Blades in the Dark and Apocalypse World this week!) at present.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453844/#Comment_453844" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-13T21:02:07+00:00" title="June 13, 2016  9:02PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, that sounds amazing!!<br/>Jason, The Warren also sounds great.

On Tuesday night played the 3rd-ish session of <b>Curse of Strahd</b> with 6th level characters the group brought over from a previous Ravenloft-like 5th ed. game. So far we've been just <i>lighting up</i> encounters, although we did have a bit of trouble with a group of hags. Fully expect the DM to drop the hammer on us next week.<br/><br/>On Wednesday I finished up the quickstart scenario for <b>Blades in the Dark</b> with the group-o-twelve-year-olds. Having seen their scheme to rob the Red Sashes' treasury go completely sideways, the kids seized on an opportunity the opposition presented and ignited a bunch of noxious gas, blowing the roof off their targets' hideout. I don't know how much 'heat' that earns them, but it's got to be <i>lots</i>.<br/><br/>Then, on Friday, played the 2nd session of <b>Apocalypse World</b>, using 2nd edition stuff. We're starting to learn how the disappearances of young women around our settlement may be connected to the psychic maelstrom, and the requisite gang of hungry raiders just appeared on the horizon. Oh, and my character drove a modified 18-wheeler through a flash flood/mud slide, nearly wrecking the truck and surely earning a future beating from its owner. The MC for this game hasn't ever run a PbtA game before - they've mostly run d20/D&amp;D, though they've played in all kinds of games - so there have been a few spots of trouble with fiction-first GMing and their trying to adjust to the permission AW gives you to GO HARD at the characters.

A very critically acclaimed module. And the party hadn't find it after a dozen sessions but today they did find it and we started running it. But even after a couple of encounters I was thinking no no no no I hate running these sort of adventures.<br/><br/>What's the problem? Without spoiling too much, the second part of the module is a river trek. Which, at our table since they're going upriver, pretty much turned into "this happens, then this happens, then this happens". I hate that.<br/><br/>The first part of the module has a very unconventional structure. I was skeptical towards it but it turned out to work. Not great, but it did work.<br/><br/>The third part of the module has yet another structure, one I'm more comfortable with but  I haven't printed it out or prepped it so I'm glad we wrapped up before we got there (but they almost got there so I better get to work.)<br/><br/>So, the linear structure of the second part? That's a big problem for me. The second issue is that it's more gross-out horror compared to CoS which more typically has relationship horror or emotional horror.<br/><br/>And the third issue was that I had decided that the starting event of DCO would happen as soon as the players came to the town where I had hidden it. And, they thought it felt very scripted. During lunch break I explained what was going on, that it wasn't a part of CoS (they thought the very opportune timing of this major event was a part of CoS, where it was just DM mess up in the "glue" between CoS and DCO), that I had decided that this event would happen when they got here and they were like OK, it's cool for sure, we just were angry at CoS but this is an understandable setup now that we know the backstory.

Now our principals are in the thick of it: my HVA spy, whose "cold" is she has exactly zero trust in her handler, was recruited as a double agent by KGB (despite the two agencies supposedly being allies, it looks like the Russians want to keep their East German colleagues on a short leash), while the other guy - an East German worker spying for the West German service West of the wall - was sent to ambush mine and give her a rough time as his initiation ritual to infiltrate a well-connected neo-nazi group (with no knowledge of her actual role as a spy). But no supporting cast have been written out yet, thus I anticipate another 1-2 sessions worth of play before this atrocious mess is over. I'm really liking the game, as expected, despite a few minor quibbles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454258/#Comment_454258" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T01:42:25+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  1:42AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I'll be at Dexcon, yes.

Kale's player interpreted the Key of the Mission as meaning he had been hired by Flint to make sure the Lady got to her destination (and this was a pretty dark Kale).<br/><br/>I usually try to give my players the chance to interact with Captain Hollas (there are so few named NPCs that I assume that Hollas must be important), and as usually happens in those cases, they kidnapped the good Captain. I had great fun sowing discord among the PCs, surprised everyone by having Hollas give his word of honor to protect Lady Blackbird (he knew she was a noblewoman, and once he gave his word he stopped speculating on her identity), and finally had him do a heel-face turn when he confirmed that Vance had abandoned the cruiser <i>Hand of Glory</i> because she wouldn't fire on a refugee ship--the loss of the <i>Glory</i> was revenge taken by the rebels after they pressed the attack (Vance was unable to convince the other captain to break off.)<br/><br/>It was one of the better Lady Blackbirds I've done :-)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454259/#Comment_454259" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-27T04:38:23+00:00" title="June 27, 2016  4:38AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Lisa at Games on Demand you usually have a "menu" with two game offerings on it, with a cool illustration and a punchy write-up to entice people to choose one of yours to "demand". </blockquote>\nOh, that!

Our philosophy was that suffering is suffering: it makes no difference if the person has been dead for a thousand years, their pain is just as deserving of treatment as any other patient. We stopped the Black Plague which unintentionally plunged overpopulated Europe into whole new wars. Guesses whether it all went to hell?

It's actually the very first time I recorded a game of Microscope and it could not have been more fun.

Still covers things like getting a letter of credit (if that's what <i>really</i> called for), being received by important people, being allowed into exclusive circles, but also - for example - being allowed into a restricted facility (prison, asylum) or crossing an international border.

Rough sledding all around.<br/><br/>They found themselves the reluctant-but-loving-it leaders of a messianic cult that expected them to lead the Parchmeal warren to salvation in the care of the Men in White Coats and the Land of Cages. They were living under a freeway overpass (A Deathway, in rabbit parlance) and were sickly and pathetic and overcrowded. It was quite a pickle.<br/><br/>These cult rabbits reserved a particular hallucinogenic berry for their saviors, and they had briefly tripped previously, so they did it again with a sense of purpose. They'd go to the dreamlands and find an answer to their problem. I made a custom When You Trip Balls move. <br/><br/>For the dreamlands I went big and mythopoetic, drawing heavily from the Anahuac and the Flowery Dream World. They met Lord Wind amid a landscape of endless trees that never reached the ground; they escaped some snakes, they had a weird conversation with Mother Earth in the darkness, asking her where they could take their warren to that would be safe. She told them life would never be free from danger, and that their "safety" lay in the wombs of their does - their lot in life was to out-breed those that would harm them. They were like "thanks a lot, that's a bummer."<br/><br/>So they took stock, gave some rousing speeches, and got Parchmeal's warren moving to greener pastures. We used +Marshall Miller's custom move and it was bruuuuuutal:<br/><br/><b>When the entire warren relocates, add dice to a pile, one for one, for each statement you can say \u201cyes\u201d to:</b><br/><i>You were once, or still are, a small warren<br/>But then you were not so small any more<br/>And in recent years you were very large <br/>The calamity came without warning<br/>Your best are away and cannot lead you to safety<br/>You are being hunted or exterminated</i><br/>Parcel out the dice among all the players and have them roll. The total is the number of adult rabbits lost or killed in the great trek. At least one rabbit per die should be a named rabbit. Half the lost will be does, and when a doe dies so do her kits. Remember that rabbits can\u2019t really count.\ufeff<br/><br/>About 50% of the warren died on the trek, and they are not even done yet.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454408/#Comment_454408" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T12:04:25+00:00" title="July  1, 2016 12:04PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yesterday two very good and productive playtest sessions of "Flashback Bullets", my new narration game for 3-4 players.<br/>Game procedure is complete and with no "bugs". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454424/#Comment_454424" name="Item_184" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T17:21:35+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  5:21PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how I would feel about playing a game where there were no "bugs" allowed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454531/#Comment_454531" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T22:47:20+00:00" title="July  2, 2016 10:47PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thursday <b>Feng Shui</b>.

In brief, some of the players struggled at first to go for the full-throat epicness of the Long Journey sequence; an attempt by Jeff to pull us back on course after a break backfired, unintentionally I guess, and Jeff being the excellent GM he is followed the players. Mostly there were a few issues making some political analogues as commentary on moves (we were joking around about convincing a guardian spirit to take its accumulated vacation time and go look for work with some nomads) that spun out into anarchist dwarves (this was a bit offensive to one of the players, a no-kidding anarchist who had been in Seattle during WTO) and ultimately collapsed with the introduction of the titan Bernardus Sanderson. (Le sigh.)<br/><br/>I mean...up until that last bit, it wasn't a case of any single thing breaking tone beyond repair, just a snowballing of tone breaks that spun the game out of any hope of regaining tone.<br/><br/>We had a similar issue a few times in Fall of Magic (at least from where I was sitting), so it is much on my mind, especially since I consider one of the few areas of authority I keep as GM is to be a guardian of tone: not in an imposing way, more in a "let's try to steer back to where we agreed to be" way. Of course, most of my long-form GMing over the last two years has been Trail of Cthulhu, and while I have my own spin on my reboot-heavy stuff ("Buffystar Galactica" sums it up), that doesn't mean that I won't try and push back gently against too much comedy.<br/><br/>So yeah, more than this probably deserves a thread on tone maintenance in general, as I have other thoughts on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454661/#Comment_454661" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T19:06:27+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  7:06PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2016 9:01PM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Curse of Strahd</b>, the party left the dam in Deep Carbon Observatory to go back to Barovia.

The PCs get discharged out of the Navy for gross incompetence and unceremoniously dumped on a "nicely inconspicuous" planet named Dennis with no cash. Then they pursue their Big Dream of controlling their own destiny as free traders. This involves combing junkyards for hulks that can be fixed up, securing a loan through banks or sharks, fixing up the ship, and navigating organized crime and bureaucracy along the way.<br/><br/>I ran that one twice. The first table (with Mel White) had lots of money and options and made a lot of missteps and just had some really bad dice luck. They were hella entertaining, though! Invite everyone important on the planet to a party and watch the fireworks. The second table started with literally zero money, spent the first hour just trying to find food and shelter, and worked up a scheme to illegally launder ship shares through the black market with a mob boss as a silent partner. <br/><br/><b>Independence 2776,</b> is where I transplant the American Revolution into an alternate Traveller universe and file off the real world references. Specifically, it's the bit where Knox convinces Washington to let him take a bunch of patriots off to steal cannons abandoned at Ft. Ticonderoga to help with the Boston Harbor blockade. All transformed into science fiction with hyperspace and meson cannons and you just have to have a Lafayette character even if he doesn't really belong on that mission. <br/><br/>I ran that one three times. The first was sketchy as I was really nervous, underprepared, and some of the pregen stuff just didn't work right. My wife helped me rejigger the character backgrounds a little and I moved some skills around so that everyone felt useful in every part of the story. The second and third games were amazing.<br/><br/>The final game was a family of four players: Mom and Dad, and two children, ages 9 and 11. Once I got the parents to stop helicoptering (I think they were concerned that the kids weren't "playing right" and I'd be upset), the kids (and parents) performed marvelously. I softpedaled the androids-as-SF-slaves aspects of the setting quite a bit, but my heart melted when the 11-year-old girl playing the emancipated android character, "TK-44," asked me and her mom, "Why does my character not have a real name?" and Mom told her, "Do you want to have a real name? What do you want it to be?" Also when the 9-year-old boy, playing the "alien" local / Native, got bullied in a human bar and eventually was challenged to a duel. The young player insistently de-escalated the fight and eventually walked out of the bar, honor be damned, because he wanted to live in a world where there was less fighting. Of course, in the final space battle scene, he had no problem pointing out that he should be able to use the grenade launcher (that I put on his sheet and forgot about) to attack the space fighter ships that were harassing them, and cackling with glee when he rolled two "hull" hits in the same location, meaning that he shot through the hole he had made and exploded the fuel tank inside.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottM" title="ScottM"><img alt="ScottM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/358751423_eee4729c81_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottM">ScottM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454838/#Comment_454838" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T19:22:30+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  7:22PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a great weekend and played a number of games (but most were board games).

And I saw something big that I completely missed as DM. It says, and paraphrasing to avoid spoilers, "It is so noisy so it's easy to sneak there".<br/>So I told the assassin PC to replay that initial few rounds [he had been blasted away in one round in the original playthrough]. And sure enough, he could drop in 2d8+10d6 damage with his silvered sword. 38 damage.<br/>And, since when the last PC went down, their enemy had 34 damage, I wanted them to then be alive.<br/>But they were so reluctant. They were like "Sandra. These things happen. We'll make new characters, don't worry." And then they offered a compromise: let's roll off death saves together to see who wakes up first, the last PC who fell, and the enemy.<br/>And... they made their death saves at the same time. So 1d4 hours roll off!<br/>And I rolled a one and I was happy because I misthought and thought low = bad and that he just had to roll over. But no. He reminded me that he had to roll higher. And I started spinning around in the room, I was so upset.<br/>And they were like "no, relax, don't make our characters survive. Move on.<br/><br/>Removing the high stakes from D&amp;D and all you've got left is yahtzee."<br/><br/>And, and, and... the lingering injury the enemy sustained will be lethal in as many days as the enemy had HP unless someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 roll.

I had great fun sowing discord among the PCs, surprised everyone by having Hollas give his word of honor to protect Lady Blackbird (he knew she was a noblewoman, and once he gave his word he stopped speculating on her identity), and finally had him do a heel-face turn when he confirmed that Vance had abandoned the cruiser <i>Hand of Glory</i> because she wouldn't fire on a refugee ship--the loss of the <i>Glory</i> was revenge taken by the rebels after they pressed the attack (Vance was unable to convince the other captain to break off.)<br/><br/>It was one of the better Lady Blackbirds I've done :-)</blockquote>\nOh, that's clever.

She's a <b>chaotic good ifrit bard 6 / swashbuckler 3 named Julia Darby</b>. She kills monsters with her voice, and sometimes with her flaming rapier +1, flameburst. We've played since 1st level.<br/><br/>We're underground. Julia doesn't like it underground at all, but, like, the world is seriously in danger here. An elder god was trapped in these caves a long time ago and he seems to be trying to get out. We figured out that he devours a small part of a creature and then has some control over that creature forever. He's taken fingers and limbs from a giant horde of hobgoblins and they're threatening to spill over into our local kingdom. That's what got us down here.<br/><br/>After defeating one of his abberation minions, he showed up. When his spell resistance totally defeated my Sow Thoughts spell attempt (and I had rolled an 18 to break his spell resistance), I realized that we had very little chance of defeating this thing in combat. I managed to negotiate the release of our halfling ninja's mom, who was (we thought) captured by the godling, and the bigbad let us leave, as long as we went into the lower passages instead of back the way we came. <br/><br/>Sure, we suspected it was a trap and stuff. We were ready for a fight. What we got instead was a hazardous environment. The caves on the way into the depths have two problems:<br/><br/>1. There are runes on the caves that channel arcane energy. Cast an arcane spell and bad shit can happen. I got Confused when I cast a spell at one point.<br/><br/>2. There's some kind of poison effect due to a sort of visual hallucination (but not illusion?) that requires Fortitude saves to avoid taking a 1-point Constitution drain (permanent loss until Restored). We make those checks once per hour and the DC is 13. <br/><br/>We had to travel for hours and hours. Julia's Constitution dropped from 12 to about 8. We eventually started facing Exhaustion for not sleeping, because we didn't want to spend 6 hours in one place. <br/><br/>Sifting through everything on my character sheet, I eventually came across this option. <br/><br/>I have a Magic Vestment that lets me cast spells off scrolls without losing them. I have a few large scrolls with a sort of library of 1st-3rd level bard spells. One of those spells is Mirror Hideaway, which lets turns a large enough mirror into a portal that eight people can crawl into, safe from magical effects outside, for six hours. Our party is six or so plus three hobgoblins who are accompanying us. At first, I thought we could use my pocket mirror, and have the ranger pick it up and run with us in it, but 1) we can't enter a mirror so small and 2) you can't move it very far without the spell ending.<br/><br/>Eventually, we had the cleric Create Water on the shiny black rock, and we used it as a mirror for the spell. The characters with the best Fortitude saves stayed outside while we caught six hours of sleep in the mirror and recharged our spells and powers. The cleric is gonna pray for a whole lot of Slow Poison spells to help us get through the rest of this leg of the caves.<br/><br/>We're not sure how much further we have to go, but we can use this strategy once a day. <br/><br/>One thing resource-management games can do well, that story-oriented games without resource management don't do so well, is make you feel really desperate and afraid. We're running out of spells and gadgets. We're running out of options. Hell, we're running out of Constitution (thus life).

We got up and running and created a decent story in only a few hours.<br/><br/>Since this one went so well (we avoided gonzo experimentation), I'd be interested in seeing what'd come next in a sequel. Backtracking: I say it went well, and we did get three interesting characters out of it, but. The but was the goal/direction overlap; I started with a meeting, but there weren't strong cross purposes between the characters I chose. Of the three players, the outland merchant kind of bounced into an interesting semi-parallel game after that first scene; he was busy extracting his revenge on NPCs who formed a separate social circle from those the other two characters wrestled with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/milesgaborit" title="milesgaborit"><img alt="milesgaborit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/747/nVUCQU91ZGMO9.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/milesgaborit">milesgaborit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455091/#Comment_455091" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-14T20:07:16+00:00" title="July 14, 2016  8:07PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh wow...it was a big week...<br/><br/>So, I started the week with a big camping trip with a bunch of other families: 20-odd kids, nearly 40 people total. The overlap with this group of kids and the weekly D&amp;D group is pretty significant, so a lot of gaming happened in the woods. Board games included Coup: Reformation; Ticket to Ride; Give Me the Brain; Dragon Slayer; and Lunch Money. And we also played a little freeform LARP scenario I made for the occasion - <b>It Came from The Lake!</b> - which was about fungus monsters. Good times!<br/><br/>And THEN! I got to attend <b>GoPlayNW</b> last weekend, which is always a highlight of my gaming year. Here's what I played there:<br/><br/><b>Icons</b> - the GM ran this game with a stripped down "let's just story game this!" ruleset for Icons. The setup was a riff on the old X-Men Inferno storyline, but instead of the villain trying to destroy the world to get revenge on ONE of her old exes, ALL of the heroes had actually dated (and somehow spurned) the supervillain. We had some really cool moments (and I LOVED my super-earnest-but-with-zero-emotional-intelligence sentient AI hero - his was the saddest story of all!), but the Icons system (and chargen in particular) still got in the way some and slowed things down. Still, big fun!<br/><br/><b>Night Witches</b> - This was my first game of Night Witches and it did not disappoint! NW is probably the crunchiest version of PbtA I've encountered - there just seem to be a lot of moving parts - but everything slots together so elegantly. I'm really in love with the Marks subsystem - it's a nice way of mechanically codifying "story" damage, and gives another cool output for Moves with negative consequences. Going to be stealing from it heavily <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/><b>Tall Pines</b> - This is my game, which is basically a Twin Peaks emulator - a surreal murder mystery story making machine. Played a great game of it on Saturday night, and got good feedback. I've got one more new wrinkle I want to playtest before I call this thing finished and ready for public consumption. Our story involved a rich older woman who had ritualistically killed her much younger lover...with the assistance of a travelling salesman's ghost. Or something. There was also a hole in the woods that seemed to connect to another dimension where the murder victim was still alive, but as some sort of animal maybe. Most of the big reveals came in the form of taped hypnotist sessions with the victim before their death. It was a successfully weird game!<br/><br/><b>Improv for LARPers Workshop</b> - Karen Twelves ran a sequel to her much loved Improv for Gamers workshop. Got to do some fun improvisational work with some of my favorite people - and also new friends! As usual, came away with a ton of insights that I will do my best to bring forward into my next game.<br/><br/>That was GoPlay. And then on Tuesday my biweekly D&amp;D group played a session in our ongoing <b>Curse of Strahd</b> game. The GM gave us an excuse to split the party and we took the bait. Fortunately for us (and unfortunately for the GMs prep), our mini-parties of 8th level characters made short work of every encounter we faced. I even one-shotted a leveled NPC Druid. 8th level storm clerics are not to be effed with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455115/#Comment_455115" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-15T18:24:16+00:00" title="July 15, 2016  6:24PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I ran <b>City of Brass</b>, my "West Marxist" <b>D&amp;D 5e</b> sandbox again on Wednesday.

That last was unexpectedly delightful because this is a character who's been around a lot, and we've seen him getting those skills in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455135/#Comment_455135" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-17T03:09:02+00:00" title="July 17, 2016  3:09AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Highlights included the pilot promising Hedy Lamar (both of them PCs) that she'd get the actress out of there if she could, </blockquote>\nYou skipped over the sexual tension of that scene :-) I on the other hand was swinging it that way even if, alas for the world's butchest aviatrix, Heddy does not...um...swing.

Good game and great ending, mixing personal tragedy with a humorous-but-scary, almost Kafkaesque portrayal of bureaucracy, finishing with an intensely poetic vignette. Just a few minor hiccups, in the form of small procedural details that we couldn't find instructions for in the text.<br/><br/>\u2014 that left us with plenty of time for another game, so we chose to try <i>Firebrands</i>. It was interesting, although we found that in a 3-player game our opportunities for developing the narrative were too constrained by taking turns picking from the available "games", as there is virtually no direct interaction with any NPCs, so that main characters can only be developed through interactions with other main characters. I understand this is entirely by design, so I expect the game to run smoother with a larger number of players, which means a larger pool of characters to interact with.<br/><br/>Earlier today:<br/><br/>\u2014 got to play <i>Follow</i>, at last. 4 players, and we chose the new Colony quest, which in retrospect made it pretty similar to a one-shot game of Kingdom. It was a pretty nice game and ended in dire tragedy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455149/#Comment_455149" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-18T08:23:45+00:00" title="July 18, 2016  8:23AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Saturday:<br/><br/>A playtest of my heist game.

It felt very procedural without much role-playing, as we made travelling rolls and camping rolls and such without any character development happening.

We journeyed to the mountains of the Orc Range in search of the mushroom that is Vince the Corrupter's weakness, fought some earth golems, and barely escaped in one piece. And this:<br/><br/>Arkona the Elf, to the Heir: The love of a mortal for an elf is a dangerous thing...<br/><br/>The Heir, flustered: Oh...I...<br/><br/>Arkona: For the elf. We were born before the sun. When it rose, it flamed our hearts with desire. But the sun fades all things. Each generation of elves is weaker than the last. But humans...every generation of humans have the same intensity at heart. Perhaps not as strong as it was for the elves, in the beginning, but it stays the same generation after generation.

I was Caspian the Golem of Ravenhall and I established him as long silent watcher over the scrying pool that was awakened by the Magus.  Which was kind of a passive character.  Made it somewhat difficult to establish really good scenes.  I kind of had to back my way into them.  A third player would have made that easier I think.

One of my favourite <i>Dogs</i> games was a series of sessions I ran for a group of players who had never played <i>Dogs</i>. They were keen to develop some backstory for their characters, so I structured the game as a series of visits. Each week this brand-new group of Dogs would visit one of their hometowns. This made a great dynamic for the game, where the players contributed a fair bit to the design of each Town (I would ask them to tell me a little about a significant person in their family), and then often came to loggerheads about the issues in each particular Town. (For instance, three of the Dogs would try to convince the fourth that his father needed to be removed from his role as Steward, or they would argue over the necessity to punish another Dog's old childhood crush.)<br/><br/>I used a semi-random process to inject a few twists into each Town (as changes which took place while they were off training to be Dogs), and it was very satisfying.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This week, I ran a storytelling game I wrote about ten years ago (called "Musette") for a small group of non-gamers <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20734/fiasco-story-games-appeal-and-tabletop" rel="nofollow">who got really excited about <i>Fiasco</i></a>. <br/><br/><i>Musette</i> is a very structured, procedural game in terms of the players' roles, which leaves a lot of room to explore the fiction itself. (Kind of like <i>Microscope</i> in terms of design balance, although it drives the drama a lot more, and has the potential to be played competitively.)<br/><br/>Our story was a dystopian near future with a strict separation between rich and poor, and the new introduction of sentient robots as an additional "lower class". One of the protagonists was a naive and misunderstood robot who was blamed for a recent riot. The others were a poor old woman who was sitting on incredible wealth she wasn't allowed to legally access (and her conflict with her upper-class daughter, who wanted the money), and an angry aging banker who was so angry at the whole system that he wanted to bring down the very bank he'd spent his whole life working for.<br/><br/>We had a lovely social shaming dynamic going on between humans (who had proper, full names) and robots (who had only a code name and number, no last name, but tried desperately to earn a "human" name). <br/><br/>In the end, the old banker used the robot's ("KVN436", who wished to be called "Kevin") naivete to trick him into setting up a massive electronic bank robbery. This sparked a second riot, wherein "KVN" was, quite tragically (as he was innocent), killed by a mob of angry citizens throwing bricks.<br/><br/>However, before dying, "KVN" managed to explain to the daughter that the true situation behind the first riots was a setup. He was innocent, and his dying words revealed to her a massive conspiracy working behind the scenes.<br/><br/>The old lady and her daughter were reunited in the hospital and came to terms with their lost fortune. Unfortunately, the daughter took a blow to the head during the riot and couldn't remember what "KVN" had told her in his last moments.<br/><br/>The old banker was the only one to truly come out ahead: he retired with the stolen money and lived out the rest of his days on a tropical island.<br/><br/>I was really pleasantly surprised by how immediately the players grasped the idea of story gaming and plunged into it head on. We had a great time, finished exactly on time (2 1/2 hours - I've played my own game enough to be able to pace it accurately these days), and they are definitely hooked on the idea of story gaming. We'll definitely be doing it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis" title="wdavidlewis"><img alt="wdavidlewis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/256/nEGTDPV2N4H5B.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis">wdavidlewis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455908/#Comment_455908" name="Item_276" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T06:55:01+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  6:55AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our group played <b>Geiger Counter</b> for the first time (for all of us).

He would buy all the potions instead of the kids, basically. <br/><br/>In a later session, another group of PCs decided this was bullshit and went to confront him, but the player wasn't present. I played Grog as an NPC, and he got his ass whooped and they basically kidnapped Hengritte and put her on lockdown while they tried to break her addiction. <br/><br/>To be fair to Grog's player, I have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">split the timelines</span>. When Grog's player shows up, we will replay that whole scene, with me playing the other PCs as NPCs (because they most certainly won't be there--the two play groups are totally bifurcated). If Grog gets his ass whooped again in a similar fashion, then the timelines merge and all is fine. Otherwise, I just have two divergent timelines. The player groups will almost assuredly never play together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis" title="wdavidlewis"><img alt="wdavidlewis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/256/nEGTDPV2N4H5B.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis">wdavidlewis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455922/#Comment_455922" name="Item_281" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T16:39:32+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  4:39PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Our group played <b>Geiger Counter</b> for the first time (for all of us).</blockquote>\nWhich version?<br/></blockquote>\nThe August 2008 beta edition with the octopus on the front page.

It's interesting and challenging for me because I prefer a totally analog game table but for this the iPads and iPhones are in full play. It's super useful for a modern-day campaign, and fun to make use of Google maps and other online resources on the fly, but I really hate having any of my attention on a device instead of the players or my hard prep.<br/><br/>The game itself is fun and everyone is enjoying themselves as they find themselves on the run across Eastern Europe, contacts and bank accounts folding in their wake as they try to make sense of the overlap between vampire R&amp;D and the War on Terror. A lot of planning time spent before infiltrating black sites, and a ton of hacking. The combo of hacking with physical infiltration is a great thing.<br/><br/>The main drawback I'm finding to the DD's "improvisational campaign structure" is that I have to do like 10x the homework than I would have to do in a more structured setting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456197/#Comment_456197" name="Item_293" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T06:05:42+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  6:05AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've been running a *World hack of The Dracula Dossier, finished our... 8th? session last week.</blockquote>\nDo you have a version of the rules you use that we could look at?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456239/#Comment_456239" name="Item_294" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-13T01:46:27+00:00" title="September 13, 2016  1:46AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Lisa -- Sure, here's the hack and my campaign notes:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mtw3ytf1h0iz2ef/AACs4q2R6tc45Af6j1nAwYJBa?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mtw3ytf1h0iz2ef/AACs4q2R6tc45Af6j1nAwYJBa?dl=0</a><br/><br/>All pretty rough around the edges, but it's getting the job done at our table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456240/#Comment_456240" name="Item_295" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-13T01:49:22+00:00" title="September 13, 2016  1:49AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon World prison break went okay but I felt like I want being true to the fiction enough by letting them get away with something basically impossible (which I had set up for them in the first place) for the sake of advancing the story.

Six randomly-generated level zero villagers, a crofter, a woodsman, a stoic tax collector, a hunter, an innkeeper and, most hilariously, a large-handed, very strong, very stupid scribe, strike out to reclaim the stolen Hand of St. Ignys in the midst of an apocalyptic storm. They follow a clue to the forbidden Standing Stones and learn that ghostly creatures from beyond the Black Gates are breaking through. One villager dies by ghostly bat swarm. They eventually catch up with the Paladin and Acolyte of St. Ignys who stole the Hand, and learn that the local cleric has been shirking his responsibilities and not bothering to perform the proper rituals to keep evil at bay, and that the Hand must be returned to the Cathedral along with the other relics to be used in a last-ditch effort to prevent the coming darkness. The villagers, foolish peasants that they are, decide that no high-talking city folk are going to steal their local relic, and try to take it back by force, resulting in the death of another villager. Ultimately the acolyte rushes off with the Hand and the Paladin begrudgingly sacrifices herself to save the (completely undeserving) remaining villagers from the ghosts, and they rush back home to tell their tale.<br/><br/>Play of the game: the crofter tries to rescue the hunter from a tar pit with a pitchfork, rolls snake eyes, and accidentally stabs her instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456596/#Comment_456596" name="Item_311" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-26T04:36:21+00:00" title="September 26, 2016  4:36AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finished up a two session story using Fate Core set in the Bureau 13 setting (Tri Tac Games.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456614/#Comment_456614" name="Item_312" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-26T17:19:49+00:00" title="September 26, 2016  5:19PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I spent the weekend playing a LongCon of Whitehack in Maze of the Blue Medusa.

Brandon has been playing traditional RPGs for a long time and is trying to break out of the mold. His game is fairly traditional and not too narrative, but he had a resolution mechanic that gave you the option to choose how much of your dice pool was allocated to a given task. If you allocated all of your dice you would have a greater chance of success at that task but other things might be neglected; for example, you could roll all of your dice to aim your laser gun but you might not be very aware of other dangers in your environment. This mechanic didn't seem very flushed out or strictly defined; it seemed rather slippery and up to Brandon's impromptu interpretation. That said, I never really got a chance to "look under the hood" so maybe things are more defined then they seem. The dice mechanics were definitely different...players would role a combo of d30s, d20s, d10s, and d6s hoping to roll higher than a target number (say a 7 for example) on every die, and the   GM would also roll for this number but using a d6 dice pool that was variable in regards to the number of die rolled depending on the particular roll--needless to say, it was a confounding and strange system and unfortunately I didn't have time to ask Brandon questions about it afterwords. <br/>We played a one-shot sci-fi game with a lot of intrigue. Brandon created pre-generated characters with motives, secrets, backgrounds, etc. (but these were not part of the actual character sheets or mechanics). Brandon only had about a day to prepare and I was super impressed with his ability to weave a tangled web of intrigue. The session started slow being that we were all playing two characters and had a lot of info to absorb. It got interesting and very PVP soon as we all began  mingling at a party of who's who in a pressure controled mansion on a moon. I made a bunch of wrong assumptions that made me plant drugs in a bathroom, pull a later gun on another PC and accuse him of colluding with some space anarchists that attacked the moon home we were in and other crazy stuff. It was very interesting and fun even though it took a little bit to warm up, but eventually things started to snow ball. One of my characters had to get info from one of my other characters so I had her get him high (he was a drug addict) and flirt and pretend to be interested in him; it was kind of weird flirting with a loser (the guy was essentially Brad Pitt's character in Burn After Reading) while playing a woman...I think it gave me a little bit of empathy for the fairer sex <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Two of the other players were amazing at roleplaying and really provided a lot of  entertainment. The ending was a little underwhelming because we ran an hour over; we ended up in a "safe-room" in the mansion and radioed for help and the space anarchists and another group who was trying to overthrow the moons security in a coup basically bailed to avoid being caught by those we sent out the signal to...sorry if this is confusing...I'm leaving a lot out <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Anyway, the intrigue seemed to work because of the character's Brandon had made and the setup, despite the game having no machanics that worked to specifically create intrigue. The game design felt very traditional, where most of what the game does is a result of the GMs work rather than an outcome of the games design. It was fun, I think that Brandon is a good GM and it will be very satisfying to see his world expand as he is introduced to new design approaches <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456987/#Comment_456987" name="Item_335" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-09T23:11:19+00:00" title="October  9, 2016 11:11PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AW2 with the Sunday Skypers and a guest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis" title="wdavidlewis"><img alt="wdavidlewis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/256/nEGTDPV2N4H5B.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis">wdavidlewis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456994/#Comment_456994" name="Item_336" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-10T01:12:35+00:00" title="October 10, 2016  1:12AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A dungeon themed game of <b>Forget Me Not</b> and <b>The Quiet Year</b>.<br/><br/><b>The Quiet Year</b> had a lot of politics in it (funny timing, that).

But random encounters are brutal, and their forays into the wilderness cut their numbers down. Eventually, they made it to the Caves of Chaos, falling into area I (the minotaur's labyrinth) and barely escaping with their lives, and then into area G, where they naively accepted the food offerings from the three bugbears, who turned on the party and first slew the 2-hit-point magic-user, then slew the fighter.

Thompson in a playtest of "All Along the Watchtower", which was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Ran Kerberos: Machinery of Life, using our hack of the Atomic Robo rules.<br/><br/>I thought the game was about Our Heroes rescuing a nurse from dastardly villains doing horrible medical experiments. And yes, that all happened (with a lot of rolling for crap on my end), including Felicity turning into a clockwork white stallion and charging out of the villain's lair with the nurse strapped to a table on her back, and then charging back in with Dorian Gray on her back.<br/><br/>But apparently, what this session was about was Dorian getting jumped, much to his delight, by denizens of one of London's seedier neighborhoods.<br/><br/>GM: So, you're basically letting them beat you and rob you?<br/><br/>Dorian: Yes! Wait, my food diary!<br/><br/>At Dr. Alexander's request (he's fascinated by Dorian's physiology), Dorian started keeping a food diary. So, when the robbers tried to take it, he grabbed it and protested, thus convincing them that it must be valuable.<br/><br/>Dorian's shouts were heard by the doctor and the fourth member of the group, Ladon.<br/><br/>Ladon (sighing): I told you Dorian would happen to somebody.<br/><br/>The doctor was accompanied by Caesar, his created Child and bodyguard. They tried to intimidate the robbers into leaving.<br/><br/>And now, I started rolling well. So, Caesar starting fighting all but one of them, while the exception was in a tug of war with Dorian over the food diary.<br/><br/>Ladon sighed and tried to snatch the diary with a vine whip.<br/><br/>And again, I rolled well. Not astonishingly well, and these guys -- I was eyeballing it, not actually statting them out, but I was figuring, okay, they're thugs, so figure a +2 in the relevant fighty skill, and I rolled two +s on the dice.<br/><br/>So, there was now a three-way tug of war between Thug, Dorian, and Ladon.<br/><br/>Felicity's player was actually running late, but we figured comedic timing meant she should show up about now. When the player arrived, we described what she saw. The clockwork woman hit the thug on the head with her fist, and the player rolled a 6 to my total of 2.<br/><br/>Kerberos. There's the A plot (nefarious schemes), the B plot (social issues ranging from marriage to justice for all), and the thing we actually focus on (whatever zany thing catches our attention, often something I just kind of tossed out there, though this one was actually in the scenario).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457294/#Comment_457294" name="Item_348" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-20T14:28:15+00:00" title="October 20, 2016  2:28PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Trail of Cthulhu</b>: I ran a playtest of <b>All Along the Watchtower</b> with a certain storygamer playing Dr. Hunter S.

Our group was a fledgling penal colony: felons, outcasts, and the politically inconvenient. The planet is Gulag; an ancient cluster of space junk coalesced together by gravity through the eons. In fact, the planet may only be made of space junk.<br/>There were immediate rumors about getting rid of the weak, of leaving them on the planet\u2019s surface so the strong could then take the ship. The planet surface turned out to be highly electrically charged--portions of the planet highly alkaline, others strongly acidic, like a big ol' battery.<br/>It wasn't clear if the planet could be made to grow plant life or not. By the end of the first challenge the colony's farmer had indeed stolen the ship, and the colony had been started in a bad location.<br/>Alkaline spiders were picking off colonists. Perhaps these spiders were sentient, it wasn't clear. The spiders had been seen praying by one of the crew members but it was also speculated that it may have also been some form of a mating ritual. Acid launchers were created, but they were ineffective. The crew captured some of these spiders and locked them up in a containment chamber.<br/>A recreational "pharmaceuticals" expert stumbled on a secret, a euphoric drug that allowed him to live among the spiders. He and a felon sent to tail him left the colony and joined the spiders. Apparently, when humans who took the drug were near the spiders the spiders became docile; eventually these two crew members became the kings of the spiders and were even worshiped by them. <br/>As we approached the end, the colonists were still dying, and the food and oxygen running out fast. Experiments were made (on willing and unwilling subjects) with eating the planets' flora and fauna. The captured spider\u2019s biology was too different from humans to test the flora and fauna on. Eating the flora caused the human subjects a euphoric painless death. Eating the fauna caused a painful non-euphoric death.<br/>Mania and panic set in. All the colonists died, except those who had abandoned the mission.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457304/#Comment_457304" name="Item_352" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-20T17:17:18+00:00" title="October 20, 2016  5:17PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Pigasus the pig/mythos entity taking Jimi Hendrix to see Azathoth and then discussing whether or not he could put a Tristan chord in the song he would write about it; </blockquote>\nFantastic!<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThanks!

But I think since the narrative authority is shared  and people are coming up with ideas on the fly, and there's no way to veto, there is going to be a little craziness. People who don't play story games might not like this, but I think it makes things more creative. Of course every game isn't gonna be crazy and if you played with people who really wanted the story to be down to earth, and you stated that before hand, then you could make the story that way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> For example, you could say: we are really going for realism, this is what that means etc--and then start playing.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis" title="wdavidlewis"><img alt="wdavidlewis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/256/nEGTDPV2N4H5B.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis">wdavidlewis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457352/#Comment_457352" name="Item_360" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-21T05:39:07+00:00" title="October 21, 2016  5:39AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played <a href="http://spooky.camp/~evan/roguish.pdf" rel="nofollow">Roguish</a> as a Wizard.

Wilhelm, is this your first attempt adapting Okult to different themes/settings, or have you done it before? Do you retain the basic structure of having two intertwined timelines, the present time scenes and the flashback ones, or have you replaced it with something else for this fantasy game? Do you use some sort of predefined arc, like the escalation from Normal to Terrifying in the horror game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457982/#Comment_457982" name="Item_381" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-08T13:45:38+00:00" title="November  8, 2016  1:45PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was at Metatopia, which sort of skews the results, but:<br/><br/>Two runs of <i>Walk Among the Dead</i> (Johannes Opperman's hack of me and Ole's game <i>Old Friends</i>)<br/>Two runs of my big larp <i>The Line</i><br/>Roe Nix's <i>Storybox</i><br/>Kate Bullock's <i>Arena</i><br/>Stephen Dewey's arts and crafts magical snowstorm game<br/>Ron Edwards' game about leftist radicals in the early seventies<br/>The New World Magischola parlor larp<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457984/#Comment_457984" name="Item_382" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-08T15:02:46+00:00" title="November  8, 2016  3:02PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I'm playing in a very slow moving PbP game with OKULT mechanics, but some sort of African inspired fantasy setting.</blockquote>\nThat's interesting!

There are flashbacks, but they are not focused on a specific period, just "before the game started".

I had five players, only two of whom had played CoB before. Two were relatively new to gaming. They all seemed to have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>They confronted and almost murdered Dorrim, the pimp who had moved into the commune. He was taking advantage of Hengritte, who was funding her addiction to spirit potions through prostitution. <br/><br/>They lured him to a room and shoved him down a trap door into the basement, where he had a hard fall. They were gonna kill him, but then had a crisis of conscience and let him out.<br/><br/>With no other plan than "let him out," he did turn on them. He left peacefully but returned the next day with some strong arms from the Brass Clubs. There was a bit of a scuffle in the commune, but one of the PCs lured him away from his guards and used <i>shocking grasp</i> on him, killing him. They convinced a few of the Brass Clubs to leave but seem to be on the lam, hiding from the rest.<br/><br/>ETA:<br/>It turns out it was exactly what I needed. PCs with agency fixing their social problems.

At a wild avant garde party a new drug made the rounds; the Investigators got to finally see the full version of "The Unanswered Question, or The Stranger and the Queen", the based-on-the-King in Yellow television film they had only seen part of previously.

There was a Hocus running a sort of video-watching cult, an Operator trying to help with the food scarcity, and a Battle Babe kicking asses when needed. A bad Hocus move threw the cult into schism and they spent their time trying to tamp down rebellion while dealmaking with the local Raver gang, who wanted to be "entertained" (with a big video show) in exchange for food and batteries.<br/><br/>I facilitated <b>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</b>. I played a weaselly entomologist with passions for deception and manipulation. It all ended with the burning of the Gamma Gamma Gamma house and everyone's death. I got roached, then unroached (killing my deception passion), and then in the final event, roached again.<br/><br/>I ran <b>D&amp;D 5e (my City of Brass)</b> for a couple hours. The comrades cleaned up the pimp's dead body, left for someone else to deal with by the last group who played. They tried to help Hengritte kick her habit, but learned that there might actually be something cool going on when she takes spirit potions.<br/><br/>I ran <b>In a Wicked Age</b> using the <i>Death-Kings of War</i> oracle (IIRC). The PCs were a genius trapped in a mirror, a sand-and-wind demon seeking return of the gold ring that had been ripped from his nose, and a mystic sage martial artist trying to forge a grand magic item. The NPCs included a petty-wizard, an enemy champion, and the queen's sorcerer.<br/><br/>On Saturday, we had 9-10 people, so there was another table. John D. ran <b>Blades in the Dark</b>. I can't remember if there was a second table for the Saturday early session, or what they played. <br/><br/>It was a good weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458109/#Comment_458109" name="Item_391" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T23:41:41+00:00" title="November 15, 2016 11:41PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To celebrate my kickstarter being almost done, I hunkered down and played <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lamemage/follow-0" rel="nofollow">Follow</a></b> with the old Kingdom dream team.

I hadn't played it for quite a few years so it was kind of stop and go, especially when we came to the dice stuff. I remembered how much I enjoyed character set-up (we did the SGS character-blind set-up). We were the witch resistance trying to overthrow the government in the ancient world! It was excellent.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458186/#Comment_458186" name="Item_393" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-18T14:52:01+00:00" title="November 18, 2016  2:52PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This week I played <i>Crypts and Things</i> and <i>Undying</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/milesgaborit" title="milesgaborit"><img alt="milesgaborit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/747/nVUCQU91ZGMO9.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/milesgaborit">milesgaborit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458194/#Comment_458194" name="Item_394" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-18T23:19:41+00:00" title="November 18, 2016 11:19PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got to play so many brilliant things in the last week! <br/><br/>Last Thursday I played session 2 of my newish Burning Wheel game about abortionists and aristocrats, which went smashingly. The player of the abortionist character is new to RPGs, but nonetheless nearly pushed her way into a 3 way duel of wits because <i>she is bringing the heat!</i> The player of the aristocrat character got seduced by the object of his erstwhile romantic pursuits...afterward, he had the impression that things had gone too easily for him, and he's right (though he won't find out how bad he screwed up until next session).<br/><br/>Over the weekend I had a whole mess of amazing people over to my place for a little house con action. Got to play two of Mr. Morningstar's LARPs - Juggernaut and The Climb. I'd played The Climb a few times before, but this was the first time I got to go to the summit and do the 'radio play' portion of the game...and it was amazing! Juggernaut was fabulous, and totally created a convincing sense of dread and pre-destination...feeling powerless has never been so fun and intense! (It helped that the groups I played those games with were composed of 100% elite game peeps)<br/><br/>House con also gave me a chance to play Bluebeard's Bride. I really enjoyed the inter-character sniping in that game, and am super keen to GM it. The parts I like best when I GM horror are describing creepy, enigmatic, otherworldly things...and that's like pretty much all you do as a GM in BB. No set up, no building a sense of normalcy to contrast the horror - you just bring the creepy!<br/><br/>Finally, this Wednesday I played in the 2nd session of a game of The Warren that one of the 12 year olds in my weekly kids group is running. It's a big group, so the fact that the kid running it was able to give everybody spotlight and manage the group splitting into three was pretty impressive. He needs to learn to drop the hammer when it's time to make a hard move, but a lot of folks have trouble getting comfortable with that aspect of PbtA - really looking forward to seeing how this little duder develops as a GM!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458228/#Comment_458228" name="Item_395" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-21T00:53:22+00:00" title="November 21, 2016 12:53AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Saturday evening game: first session (out of two at least, possibly more) in another playtest run of <i>The Truth Dies with Them</i>, my cold-case police procedural game about capital punishment. I have no idea when I'll manage to get the rules down on paper as an actual, usable text, you know - for the time being, I'm content enough playing the game and confirming it works more-or-less as intended.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon game: second session in our <i>Archipelago III</i> 1700s France small town supernatural horror/murder mystery. The general feeling still reminds us of a game of <i>Okult</i> a lot, but in addition to that the details of the supernatural mystery are taking up weird <i>Left Coast</i>-ish colors (is the consciousness of people from the past actually possessing those who venture into the swamp? or is there an alternate explanation to their amnesia?) while the murder mystery side of the tale has just gone for a political spin (has some higher Church authority ordered the abbot dead just to keep him from investigating the mysteries surrounding the old ruined church building?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458243/#Comment_458243" name="Item_396" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-22T06:36:54+00:00" title="November 22, 2016  6:36AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a lot of stuff at Metatopia, most of which involved R-maps that got me right into the game, PbtA, or both.<br/><br/>The Wednesday after, I did character, homeroom, and town generation for Monsterhearts 2, with a couple of folks I usually game with and a couple of folks who had been looking for games. (That reminds me that I need to calendar the next session.)<br/><br/>This past Wednesday, I did Kerberos Machinery of Life, adapting a Victoriana scenario which is 90-95% solid, and 5-10% WTF (involving a scheme a friend pronounced "underpants gnomes" level of WTF, in fact), counting on the way we play to keep me from having to figure out that last 5-10%. This worked. I now have some ideas for what to swap in, along with notes for what leads NPCs will be coming back to PCs with, who Dorian's seducing now, and the kinds of trouble Dr. Alexander's family can get itself into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs" title="Caroline_Hobbs"><img alt="Caroline_Hobbs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/121/nILD1Q33E03N4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs">Caroline_Hobbs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458577/#Comment_458577" name="Item_397" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T00:16:07+00:00" title="December  6, 2016 12:16AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried a couple of games I'd never played before this week!<br/><br/>My first was <b>A Scoundrel in the Deep</b>, which is from issue 6 of Worlds Without Master. When the facilitator was pitching it, I couldn't help but think of Earthsea, so that's what we did. As the Scoundrel I very stressfully navigated my way out of the caves and into redemption, confronted at every turn by shadows from my past misdeeds. In the game you have until a match burns out in your hand to solve a problem by the light of the flame. I only burnt my fingers once! The rules are written a little opaquely and not brief enough to be read by candlelight. But don't be fooled--it's a really great game. Will definitely play again.<br/><br/>My other game this week was <b>Bootstrapping</b>, which is a game in fresh playtest by Max Hervieux. It's set up as a series of mini-games, with each game being presented very nicely on small cards. One player is the new sentient AI, coming to terms with its identity and future. The other player is various humans, depending on the mini-game. The game has some interesting role-playing constraints and I'm excited to try it out further as it develops!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458580/#Comment_458580" name="Item_398" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T13:55:49+00:00" title="December  6, 2016  1:55PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            last week I got to run two playtests, for a tabletop/larp hybrid called <b>The Tragedy of Morgard</b> and a larp called <b>WINTERHORN.</b> They both were fun in a playtest-y way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458592/#Comment_458592" name="Item_399" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T19:15:53+00:00" title="December  6, 2016  7:15PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Fall of Magic</b> a two-shot at our Tuesday night meetup.

Meanwhile, I'm convinced I have a more-or-less solid ruleset and should definitely sketch out a public playtest document or something.<br/><br/>Sunday, one more installment in our 1700s France small-town horror <i>Archipelago</i>. Things have definitely escalated with the arrival of the bishop in town - two out of three PCs are now fugitives and somebody has set fire to the abbey library (was it the bishop?). Ghosts from the past are getting more and more talkative. The destiny points we wrote this session are to be our last ones, definitely. We need closure and denouement now, which won't be too easy, considering we've had supernatural events on stage with no agreement between players as to what's actually up (quite a challenging playstyle).<br/><br/>I really hope to finish both games next weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458699/#Comment_458699" name="Item_404" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-13T15:23:00+00:00" title="December 13, 2016  3:23PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An ongoing <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?793890-Solo-Gaming-Appreciation-Month-2016-Trollbabe-actual-play&amp;p=20665787#post20665787" rel="nofollow">solo session of Trollbabe</a>.

At least, Linus thinks it was them, but there are currently pirates from Hammerhead working for the Galliardans there, which is a nuisance because Linus can't outbid Galliard). Still, despite everything, Old Terra has not gone up in flames, so that's... probably something.<br/><br/>I ran Kerberos II, Machinery of Life, using a Victoriana scenario, as usual. And, I figured we'd wrap that particular scenario tonight. Right, the fight with the vampire, a minor thing, surely, and then information leading to the big thing, which I actually mapped out to make sure I had an explanation that a) worked for my game (which isn't Victoriana) and b) made a whole lot more sense to me than the explanation in the scenario (which, apart from that bit is solid, but that bit -- well, a friend of mine described the scene as on the level of the underpants gnomes).<br/><br/>So, things took a left turn at the vampire. Dorian Gray wanted to see how she fed, but his companions kept attacking her! And he was crap at stopping them. And then, he addressed her, saying, "My dear, shall we continue this conversation at the Kerberos Club?"<br/><br/>This is an NPC intended as a minor or moderate nuisance in Victoriana, you understand, pretty much supposed to be disposed of by the PCs. But, this _is_ Kerberos Club, not Victoriana, and the club's let in far stranger and more lethal things than vampires. Sure, this left some fall out to be dealt with, but the players and PCs are an imaginative lot.<br/><br/>Of course, we're currently using Atomic Robo Fate, and there are some moving parts of the system we've yet to use. Organizational Resources. Scientifick Hypotheses! And collateral damage on the game world.<br/><br/>This last may finally see some use. Our clockwork lady pretended to be a wheelbarrow and then transformed into her best interpretation of a horseless carriage (she'd seen the blueprints of the prototype in progress briefly, so how hard could it be, right?) and then modified it so that she was driving herself, and then drove through the streets of 1860 Kerberean London at night as the very item whose building laborers are protesting against. And various revolutionary factions had a falling out leading to an apparent shooting of a member of the gentry, who was unharmed, but this is still going to be A Thing. And the factory where the horseless carriage prototype is supposed to be built got a bit damaged in the fight with the vampire, which is, oddly, the least of anyone's problems.<br/><br/>And Dr. Alexander is delighted to have a vampire and a rehabilitated victim of the vampire (likely de facto some flavor of dhampire) to study. They have a schedule of appointments with him and instructions about what sort of journals about their biology to keep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458750/#Comment_458750" name="Item_412" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-19T00:35:56+00:00" title="December 19, 2016 12:35AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>The Truth Dies with Them</i>: best possible ending, in that we managed to save the prisoner's life - through an unexpectedly lucky draw when we were about to run out of time - and it turned out he was innocent indeed.

It was a two-hour one-shot. It was awful. The GM had skills, but his scenario was a railroad (and he knew it).<br/><br/>Not knowing anything about the scenario we'd be playing, I selected the paladin from a pile of 10-15 pregens. He had three skills, none of which turned out to be useful in the adventure. He had no spells. He had scale armor, a sword, and a crossbow, most of which turned out not to be useful in the adventure.<br/><br/>The other characters were a monk and a cleric. We explored a swamp, searching for the remains of another paladin who had died out here. We collectively decided we had good motives for finding the remains (religiously-oriented motivations, not murder hobo ones).<br/><br/>First we found a body in the swamp and a ghost appeared and told us where to find the adventure: around a huge tree down river. We explored a bit, found a boat, and took it down river toward the tree. The river became impassable in a swamp.<br/><br/>The next big encounter was with some kind of waterskipping eel hound. The GM told us that we knew that they usually traveled in packs and this lone monster was running toward his buddies. If he got there, we'd have huge trouble. He launched into a set of minigame rules that abstractly measured our distance to the eel hound. The cleric and I quickly realized that the halfling monk was super well suited to the game's challenges, while we were not. The two of us comically flailed around in the swamp, making decisions like "stand still and shoot, sprint across this flat, or try to cut it off by crossing the dangerous area." The monk ended up catching up to it and killing it. We were 2-3 steps behind it the whole time.<br/><br/>We found a giant skull that was the black dragon that the now-deceased NPC party had killed.<br/><br/>Eventually we slogged to the tree, found a pool behind it, saw a glowing body at the bottom of the pool, talked to the dead paladin's ghost and learned there was a baby troll guarding the pool. We pushed a giant boulder into the pool to try to lure it out. It came out. We shot at it. I decided I'd be best used as a tank while they shot at it, so I ran to meet it, but misunderstood the risk. I had to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check to get across some slippery tree trunks. Having neither, I flubbed my roll and slipped into the pool 30 feet below. <br/><br/>Wearing scale armor, I had to succeed at DC 10 Swim checks to avoid taking drowning damage. A DC 15 success would let me swim to the edge instead of treading water in place. I made the first check to tread water. I failed the second and took drowning damage but didn't die. I made the third to tread water. By that time, the troll was dead and my party helped me out. <br/><br/>None of it was fun for me. All of my choices felt forced. At the end, the GM and one of the players talked about how much of a railroad it is, and the player said, "But in such a short time, you really have no choice." I openly disagreed with him, since I run a D&amp;D sandbox adventure pretty much every other week at the same venue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458780/#Comment_458780" name="Item_415" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-20T23:54:43+00:00" title="December 20, 2016 11:54PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, Adam!

We're assuming not, and it does have the "mark xp on a failure" rule.<br/><br/>I'm needing to remember I have one player whose PC will play it safe every time (at least thus far) (mostly(*)) and one whose PC lacks normal common sense (raised by wolves).

Oh yes, the hex means the hexee (who was already accusing the PC of devil worship and the like) is seeing demons everywhere.

And the Final Horror was genuinely scary not just to the other player as the Witness, but to me as the Narrator as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458978/#Comment_458978" name="Item_420" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-03T22:17:25+00:00" title="January  3, 2017 10:17PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Tales From The Loop</i>, an improvised one-shot to assess it for games on demand at Kapcon (Wellington, NZ) which is coming up in two weeks.<br/><br/>It was really fun. I riffed off the character generation questions (that include two 'weird things you noticed recently' in particular) and the story twisted and turned as the dice came out. The story worked (there were some loose threads left, but the main mystery and problem got solved). Also, I got to include some other-dimensional killer axebeaks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458981/#Comment_458981" name="Item_421" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-04T01:05:34+00:00" title="January  4, 2017  1:05AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -<br/>-<br/>New year, so time for a new thread: <b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week" rel="nofollow">What did you play this week? 2017 Edition</a></b><br/>-<br/>-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p8" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p7">7</a><a class=" p-8" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p8" rel="prev">8</a><a class="Highlight p-9 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/p9">9</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20622%2Fx%2Fp9%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20622%2Fx%2Fp9%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
