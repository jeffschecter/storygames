There are some powers that are only effective when your character is at 'bloodied' status, which is when they reach half their hit points or lower. The merit of the mechanic is that it encourages characters to get into the fray and take some chances, which has a good chance of making fights more dramatic. Do you keep fighting on as bloodied to keep your bonuses from the related power, or do you squeal to your healer for help, thus negating the bonuses but putting you in a better position of safety? I can't think of an obvious flaw, though obviously the level of mechanical bonuses should be equal to the risk one takes by having them activate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224445/#Comment_224445" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T08:12:49+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  8:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I remember right Universalis does exactly this: more harm to a character means he/she's more anchored into the story and more difficult to get rid of.

Basically, here's the character sheet (so you can see what I'm talking about):<br><br><a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/sheets/TB0_characterSheet_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tenra-rpg.com/contest/sheets/TB0_characterSheet_01.jpg</a><br><br>So, when you take damage ("10 points of damage"), you have this system:<br>You have "Vitality" (I think it still says "Health" on the sheet), basically they're stun points, like HP Lite: When you run out of Vitality, your character passes out, and they're tapped out of the fight.<br>You have "Wounds": Light, Heavy, Critical, and The Dead Box.<br/>When you take damage, you get to split the damage up however you want: 10 points can be All in Vit, All in Wounds, 3 in Vit and 7 in Wounds, 9 in Vit and 1 in Wounds, etc.<br/>Also, on top of that, you can pick exactly where to start to fill in wounds: So if you want, if you take 1 single point of damage from a punch or something, you can be all "OK, I take that as a Heavy Wound. I feel the punch crack a rib, and I double over in pain."<br/>When you check off the Dead Box, you can remove any amount of damage: Like if you take 5, 50, or 5000 damage (impossible, but still) you can either drop Vitality to 0 and say "I'm out of the fight", or you can stay in the fight by checking your "Dead Box", but this leaves you vulnerable to dying: If your Dead Box is checked, and you then lose all your Vitality, you die for reals (probably after saying a word or two after the battle ends).<br/>You can heal the dead box naturally, but magic (Buddhist Magic) doesn't work, since "you've already determined your fate to die."<br/><br/>So the above is kinda how damage works, but here's more on the reverse death spiral:<br/><br/>When you take a Heavy Wound, you get an additional +1 die to roll on any roll you make (in combat, out of combat, etc). If you have more than one Heavy Wound, the dice effect does not stack (you don't get "+6 dice" for having 6 Heavy Wounds).<br/>When you take a Critical Wound, you get +2 dice to roll. If you have a Heavy and a Critical wound, you only get the +2 dice for your highest ranking wound. If you have 3 critical wounds, you still only get the +2 dice (not +6). However, there's a risk: You lose 1 Vit point a round, "bleeding out".<br/>When you check the Dead Box, all other effects are cancelled (bonuses, bleeding out, etc) and you get +3 dice to all wounds until you heal yourself.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>I like this system so much, that when we played our L5R first edition game (which has the most horrible death spiral of any game I know), I modified the wound track considerably: It basically went from 0,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5, Dead (etc) to 0,0,-1,-1,-2,-2,+3,+5,Dead.<br/><br/>Merits: Dramatically simulates all movies, TV, anime and comics you've ever seen, ever.<br/><br/>Drawbacks: If you're looking for Gritty Realism, keep on a'looking, because there's none here.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224450/#Comment_224450" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T08:37:32+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  8:37AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bent</cite>I can't think of an obvious flaw, though obviously the level of mechanical bonuses should be equal to the risk one takes by having them activate.</blockquote>\nWell, one obvious flaw is the slightly weird incentive to cut yourself up before entering a battle in order to get the benefits (if you think they're worth more than the hit points or injury levels or whatever you're using, anyway).<br/><br/>Now, you can just say "Don't do that" if you don't want it happening.

But that leaves you really vulnerable to being taken out as well. It's like choosing to go slow and steady through an encounter, or else high risk/high reward. If everyone wants to go for the high risk option, that's totally fine (no need to say "Don't Do That"), but there's no entitlement to bitching if there's a TPK because the players could dish out better damage but didn't have any room left to *take it*....<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224453/#Comment_224453" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T08:49:58+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  8:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Don't Rest Your Head the more Exhaustion PCs have the more Exhaustion dice you get to roll, dice which are useful towards success in conflicts.

So if you bid low, you gain tokens but lose the conflict.  If you bid high, you win but wind up with fewer tokens.  (I've been using a LARP system that does the same thing with playing cards.  It works pretty well.)<br/><br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is almost there, but not quite, as the system reward losing talking parts of conflicts, but the reward is for later conflicts, not this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224507/#Comment_224507" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T12:05:30+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With Great Power gives you more mechanical advantages the more battered and bruised you become from the villains (and removes their advantages the more they beat you up), and you actually can't beat the villains' plans until you lose five times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224512/#Comment_224512" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T12:15:29+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:15PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a Wicked Age actually kinda does this, in a way.  If you're beaten in the first round of a conflict, but not knocked entirely out of the conflict, you get your name on the Owe List.  You can then scratch your name off the list (in this conflict or another one) for a bonus die that adds to your highest roll.  This "reverse death spiral" effect is a little more obvious over the course of a story, rather than just a single conflict.

That is a pretty cool idea, as it then goes to seriousness of damage, only being able to wound someone more with more serious damage. Not entirely realistic though, as in some situations you can ping someone to death, and it would also create a problem where someone with max wounds higher than the highest damage someone can cause is essentially invincible (unless there's something else mitigating in the system).<br/><br/>Greg Stolze's A Dirty World has this to a degree, although it has both a normal death spiral and a reverse one. If you take small amounts of damage, your stats get shifted, so one goes down, the other goes up. The result is that while you get worse at one thing, you get better at another and can turn the tables by changing your tactics. If you take massive damage though (which is more rare), then it's a real death spiral. I liked having both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224586/#Comment_224586" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T18:08:21+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  6:08PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs: take lots of talking fallout, get D4s, which make for poor Sees, leading to more Fallout, get more D4s, &amp;c.;<br/>\n<br/>\nMore generally, Dogs fallout is a reverse death spiral.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224606/#Comment_224606" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T19:28:17+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  7:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite><i>Nobilis</i>and Greg Stolze's<i>...in Spaaace!</i>have a bit of a reverse death spiral thing going on</blockquote>\nNobilis actually reverses a different part of the death spiral: you need to suffer the biggest, nastiest wounds first before you start having to worry about lesser harms and injuries.<br><br>Which is interesting (to me), but not really the "you get cooler as you get closer to death" kind of reverse death spiral the OP is talking about.
