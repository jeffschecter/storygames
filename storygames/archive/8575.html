Okay, if the demon is an actual demon, no problems. If it's a guy with hankering for schoolgirl stew, no problem. But what if the demon is in fact, a group. If I use the demon dice for the cult, it's  pretty weak cult as far as it's members go (with only 15 dice to share between them before agendas and use of powers adds). If I let each memeber of the cult be their own npc with own non-demondice, it's not... well it's not the demon is it? If the demon is the cult leader... well okay, that I can work with. If the demon is the cult and all members of it can draw on the demon dice to enhance their rolls... I can see that happening, but I'd rather have someone in Authority explain it to me. That way, I can sleep easier and wont have to feel flatulent at the gaming table later. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in short - does anyone have any demon-tips regarding how to use it and how to actually make it work with a clasic cult?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190098/#Comment_190098" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T15:29:32+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  3:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that the cultists would only have their demon dice, not their own separate pools.

Having extra dice doesn't help in the moment of conflict.<br/>-The Administrator doesn't have a Best Friend or Rival; he adjudicates his own successes and failures.<br/>-A whole passel of cultists can be simulated by one die roll.

What do you mean by "in the moment of conflict"?<br/><br/>I thought you could roll any number of applicable elemental dice in a conflict.

PE is pretty kind about that. So you have a good chance of winning with just a single die. no need to roll a bunch if you don't want to.<br/><br/>What I would recommend is not stating out individul cultists, but stating the cult as a whole. Something like:<br/><br/>Fire 5<br/>Earth 3<br/>water 2<br/>Air 1<br/>Void 4<br/><br/>Whenever the girls run into any element of the cult, you'll us ethis profile. So if they face off against a guy in a spooky hood early in the game, you may want to just roll one or two dice before drawing the conflict to a close. Save those dice for later when the girls track down the cultist that's been dragging off teachers and planting mind rot weeds into their eye sockets. that's when you go ahead and blow 5 or 6 dice in one go. Save the rest for the big showdown at the end of the session, when the cult leader sends the zombie teachers after the girls.By then you should have some extra dice to play with anyway.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192138/#Comment_192138" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T13:32:41+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  1:32PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the quick answer!<br/><br/>This totally makes sense.  I just thought I'd completely misunderstood the rules, which, considering I've been fiddling with a hack for the last little while, rather threw me.  Messing up the central die mechanic would have really thrown me for a loop. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Speaking of the extra dice, is the assumption that you're going to blow through any bonus dice from unused agendas/psychic powers by the time the girls "beat" the demon/cult/whatever?  What happens if someone's success/Best Friend narration describes its defeat before the Principal gets a chance to use them up?<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192140/#Comment_192140" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T13:38:08+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  1:38PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or you can go a step further and not stat your demon at all. Just treat it as a pile of 15 dice  that you can roll without having to justify the action to a specific element. That's what I've been doing for awhile, and it seems to work pretty well.<br/><br/>Also, I usually end up giving control of the demon about half way through the game. We usually end up with an audience of boyfriends and girlfriends, so I hand the dice off to one of them, and the narration duties to another. Then I usually go get some dinner.<br/><br/>I'm not really suggesting you should do this, but it is an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
