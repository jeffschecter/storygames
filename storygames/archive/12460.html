Graham, Eero and I were unanimous in our decision - more on that in a minute. First, a few general observations and some advice. <br/><br/><b>Parlor narration</b><br/><br/>We\u2019re going to talk about parlor narration a bit in our comments, so let\u2019s be clear about what we mean.<br/><br/>To paraphrase Bill White, who is an egghead academic, \u201cParlor narration adds fictional color to a self-contained game-mechanical system, so that the "roleplaying" is a dispensable adjunct to play.\u201d  For the rest of us, imagine playing Monopoly, but as you go around the board, you narrate arriving on each square and buying property. Is this fun? Probably not, because the narration is an add-on. It has no effect on the game..<br/><br/>Whether this is a bad thing or not is an open question and subject to individual taste. Your judges are not in favor of it, despite occasionally indulging in it themselves (see Jason\u2019s games<i> Terra Nova </i>and <i>Xochitlcozamalatl</i>, both contest entries).<br/><br/>There\u2019s a great thread about parlor narration <a href="denied:\u201dhttp://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4499\u201d" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The term was coined, so far as I know, <a href="denied:\u201dhttp://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19156.0\u201d" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Parlor narration isn\u2019t the same as parlor games (Charades, yay!) or parlor LARPs (Shifting Forest Story Works, yay!). As with most contests, many of the games submitted for Little Game Chef 2010 are parlor narration games. When we see it, we call it out.<br/><b><br/>\u201cMother, May I?\u201d</b><br/><br/>\u201cMother, May I?\u201d is shorthand for games that default to a monolithic figure deciding whether your creative input is worthy of consideration.<br/><br/>Like parlor narration, this is a matter of individual taste - the entire roleplaying hobby is built on the charred bones of a \u201cMother, May I?\u201d playstyle. A number of games submitted use this technique, allowing a GM or similar role to adjudicate success or failure in an arbitrary way. That may be fine when it is the best choice after careful consideration, but it can read as designer laziness or hand-waving, and it isn\u2019t really to the judge\u2019s taste.<br/><br/><b>Over-Structuralization</b><br/><br/>Story Games as community favours contest game design. Perhaps this is the reason for why we\u2019ve come to see a certain development of small, scenario-based, strongly structured games as a sort of darwinian response to the selection-pressure. It is, after all, much easier to write a game out of random ingredients in a limited time-frame if you focus the game on one story, one procedure, with one set of mechanics intended to be used only once.<br/><br/>A designer would do well to consider if this is what they find positive and empowering in roleplaying games. There is a difference between focus and structure, and reviewing the games we have in this contest it seems that only rarely is a designer able to increase the amount of structure arbitrarily without losing creativity and imaginative interest of his audience. The normal roleplaying game requires room for the reader and player to\u201d discover things and apply the system, room that is not allowed by a game that describes a scenario, outlines a dramatic arc, allots scenes and then tells you what to say in each scene.<br/><br/><b>Advice For Future Contests</b><br/><br/>Many entries were hard to read. It\u2019s really sad, because we want to understand your games. Please think, not just about the game, but the way you write it.<br/><br/>When you refer, in your rules, to something you haven\u2019t explained yet, you are forward referencing. For example: \u201cWhen you roll damage, add your Strength to your Gun Skill\u201d, when  you don\u2019t explain Gun Skill until the next page. Please don\u2019t do this. If you must do it, say you\u2019re doing it: \u201cWhen you roll damage, add your Strength to your Gun Skill (see below)\u201d. But please don\u2019t do it.<br/><br/>Adding formatting is great when it improves readability. If you have any doubts - and you should have doubts - spaciously arranged black text on a white background in a readable typeface is the way to go.<br/><br/>Finally, try using less words. Go through your drafts and cut out anything we don\u2019t need to read. <br/><br/>OK! That's out of the way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279824/#Comment_279824" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:32:26+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:32AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, so.<br/><br/>We've given feedback on all the entries, which will follow in this thread. Not all judges have given feedback on every game, but every game has feedback.<br/><br/>Now, don't expect too much, because here's what will inevitably happen. You've written a beautiful work of art. Unfortunately, it's the 19th roleplaying game we've reviewed, and the 12th that night, and we're really tired. So we totally miss the point and just say "Hey, I like the cards. Sadly, I don't like the setting and I don't think it's playable. Still, cyberpunk, that's cool!".<br/><br/>When this happens (and it will), we're sorry in advance. In fact, looking at the first chunk of feedback I'm about to post, I'm embarrassed how little feedback I've given. However, we're happy to go into more detail if you ask. Even though we didn't like every game, we're supportive of all of them, and happy to engage in dialogue to make them better.<br/><br/>Here we go, then. As you get feedback on your game, please break your anonymity, tell us you wrote the game, ask any questions and either thank us or berate us as appropriate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279826/#Comment_279826" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:33:30+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:33AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:23PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>6 Degrees of Resolution</b><br/><br/><b>Jason:</b> This is a clever concept and it seems like the LDO would have fun. Not a big fan of \u201cjust roleplay it!\u201d, personally. Not sure the non-LDO players at any given point would enjoy themselves. I like random lists of stuff that congeal into situation but these lists are self-consciously zany - playtesting would bear this out, and they are easy to adjust. The badge is spectacular. The d30 is annoying and unnecessary.<br/><br/><b>Graham: </b>The random table is a wonderful idea. The best bit is the randomly rolled mood, which is concealed from other players. That\u2019s a comedy mechanic.<br/>That said, let\u2019s try the random table now, rolling with a d20 (because d30s are gimmicky).<br/><br/>    * I am: a marine biologist, who\u2019s resentful.<br/>    * You are overeducated and underpaid, and giddy.<br/>    * A third player is a werewolf, who\u2019s jumpy.<br/>    * What\u2019s at stake is: do we get away with it?<br/><br/>It\u2019s too much random detail. I can\u2019t construct a scene from that.<br/><br/>The LDO gets too much authority. And there are things I can\u2019t fathom: lessons to be learned? Scene framing and resolution? There\u2019s something there, and it\u2019s good, but I can\u2019t work it out.<br/><br/>Overall: good ideas, which don\u2019t fit together into a game. That\u2019s a worthy entry. The best thing: the random table, especially the random moods.<br/><br/><b>Eero: </b>The idea is basically solid. However, the game lacks a compelling setting/situation/premise; the random tables and other tools of quick situation construction need to revolve around a central theme and purpose for the six vignettes to feel like a coherent whole. Also, provide motivation for play - the common downfall of story games, and particularly contest games, is the lack of creative drive engendered by an excess of abstraction. As it is, the game lacks a really compelling subject matter that would sell the group on the exercise.<br/><br/>The die is a gimmick and the final resolution of the final scene is (purposefully?) arbitrary, almost completely random. Not that resolution would need to be less random - there\u2019s really no particular reason for the players to want victory here, so that last scene might as well be resolved randomly.<br/><br/>The game is not bad in the comedy department in that its structure works sort of like improvised theater - you\u2019re being given a bunch of random archetypal characters and asked to play out their interaction. I imagine that this will naturally encourage the players to get funny and frivolous, especially as they also have a mood they\u2019re depicting, which should inspire wacky interactions between the characters pretty reliably. This whole idea of randomizing character bits and the stakes and letting them loose is the best part of the game; I\u2019m not convinced that the elaborate flashback structure is worthwhile in the long run, but I could see a game of some sort based on this core activity.<br/><br/>A thought on the core activity of randomized sketches and the lack of a compelling subject matter: I could see a very successful game using these ideas, but predicated on a bunch of Saturday Night Live writers trying to think up a show script. Much less confusing than the multiple-flashback thing, and has more fictional context for why we\u2019re trying to be funny. Something to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279827/#Comment_279827" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:34:20+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:34AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:23PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Baggage Carousel</b><br/><br/><b>Jason:</b> I want to try this! It falls in my \u201cparty game\u201d bin, further afield even than a roleplaying poem, but that is not a dishonor in the least. I like the simplicity and the built-in humor that isn\u2019t pushed hard (it doesn\u2019t need to be - the setup is  comedy gold). I could see playing this with my Mom. If I had a complaint, it would be that the game is a little too locked down - I think it\u2019d be fussy in play to remember suit/number combinations, and I\u2019m not sure the extreme specificity adds anything. Dividing objects by suit into broad categories, and relying on creative invention, would probably ge\u201dt the job done.<br/><br/><b>Graham:</b> What fun. It\u2019s a parlour game, but tiptoeing around the edge of being a roleplaying game.<br/>Some things don\u2019t quite fit. For example, \u201cGood days\u201d and \u201cBad days\u201d: nobody cares about the winner\u2019s holiday, day by day.<br/><br/>I like the contraband.<br/><br/>As for the deck of cards: well, I love the random method of creating objects. Let\u2019s draw some now: a Seven of Spades: an ultra-modern bomb. (Why is that not contraband?) A Three of Diamonds: an expensive artificial leg. Two of Clubs: an offensive cosmetic. That works nicely, although it\u2019s not entirely together: if you draw three spades in a row, you tire of describing weapons and electronics.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a rough gem. There\u2019s the potential for a light storytelling game in there. We need more of those.<br/><br/><b>Eero:</b> Really quite solid party game design. The core of the game is in the fact that the CO and the players are using the same set of guidelines in interpreting the fictional description of an item - it\u2019s a game of telephone, basically, with the CO wrangling the otherwise straightforward set-making goal by forcing the players to try to guestimate the suit and value of the card he\u2019s describing. Having the CO break ties between claims based on the fiction is crucial, but also a potential weak link: will the CO care about the fiction sufficiently, or will he strategize his descriptions and choices to optimize his own chance of victory? Will this break the game?<br/><br/>I\u2019m not sure that the memory game part is a good idea here, but then I\u2019m often not too hot on memorization in games - too much work, and rewards dull concentration over being a fun co-player. Perhaps, if the game\u2019s fiction is deep enough, this part could work as a sort of immersion clause: the easiest way of remembering what your suitcase has is to be immersed in character, after all. I\u2019m doubtful, though, especially as we\u2019re not really interested in the epilogue stuff - we just want to know who won, that epilogue won\u2019t be necessary.<br/><br/>It comes to me that the game could maybe make use of a chargen question: is your trip for business of pleasure? Fits the theme and might act in interesting ways in inspiring the players when they make claims for the various stuff put up for offer. Also provides a potential tie-breaker for multiple claims situations, as the CO can just award the item to the person whose stated purpose of visit fits the item better.<br/><br/>Also, this probably would benefit from having some mechanics for the players to trade items amongst themselves. Seems like you\u2019ll be collecting much more than the seven (or more realistically, five) cards minimum needed for victory, after all.<br/><br/>All in all, a very solid piece. Has comedy, has ingredients. The roleplaying part is light-weight, but if the game works, that\u2019s no big deal - more important to be a good game than to be good roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279828/#Comment_279828" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:34:55+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:34AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:23PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Bread Mold Might be Medicine</b><br/><br/><b>Jason: </b>On a second read through I definitely saw this game\u2019s potential. I think the humor is very understated in a good way, an emergent way. My initial difficulty was a result of the game\u2019s length and information density. It feels like there is too much here for what it is trying to do, like it could be pared back by 50% and work better. But that\u2019s just a gut feeling, who knows? Playtest this and find out.<br/><br/><b>Graham:</b> This is cleverly done. Some rich comic ideas here: for example, the Doctor using his patient\u2019s delusions to succeed in his personal life. And the Doctor\u2019s mundane advice (which I find completely hilarious).<br/><br/>It\u2019s a sympathetic look at mental illness, too. The patients aren\u2019t zany; they aren\u2019t stereotypes; and they aren\u2019t heart-wrenchingly human, in that Tom Hanks way. They\u2019re people with interesting issues. I like it.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a complex game and I can\u2019t tell whether the economy works. In a game like this, that matters. But the initial idea is seriously good. For me, it\u2019s the best approach to comedy in this competition.<br/><br/><b>Eero:</b> A tightly scoped, ambitious design. The topic is a psychological duel of wits between the exceptionally insane Deluded and the Doctor trying to get a grip on him and the asylum society. Reminds me of Batman comics through the \u201890s, the various Hannibal Lecter -type characters and their struggles with the psychiatric institutions of Arkham Asylum often played out along these lines.<br/><br/>Overall this game reminds me of \u201cclassic Forge\u201d in many ways - it\u2019s sort of a love child of MLwM, Dust Devils and so on insofar as systemic approach is concerned. Reminds me of Drifter\u2019s Escape insofar as recent games go - of Ben Lehman design in general. The big failing in the context of this contest is the lack of comedy - this is psychological thriller and character drama, not comedy. I do admit that it\u2019s possible to read the genre differently, of course, and much depends on how the players swing it, but ever after One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest I\u2019ve found little to laugh about in asylums, personally.<br/><br/>The lack of comedy aside, however, there is much to recommend in this game: the topic has potential, the player roles are interesting and the scenario is considered exhaustively and with full understanding of the genre. I especially like the potential for the positive medical personnel role - too often this genre is one-note as regards the role of the doctor in curing his patients.<br/><br/>The \u201cchecking out\u201d rule is the hot stuff, although I\u2019m uncertain whether it\u2019s a good idea for any player to be able to declare it; might be unavoidable if the loose association of players to characters is to be preserved. The game\u2019s ending condition is also excellent.<br/><br/>My favourite thing about this game is that basically the greatest weakness here is the contest constraint: I\u2019m not convinced that the rules are as sleek as simple as they could be, but that\u2019s exactly the sort of thing that\u2019ll get fixed in playtest and development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279829/#Comment_279829" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:35:32+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:35AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:24PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Buddy Movie</b><br/><br/><b>Jason: </b>This seems nice, although I don\u2019t think it is a recipe for humor. It is a recipe for genre emulation, and it seems like it would work well for that. There\u2019s nothing here that will make play funny other than your zany partner, who you picked because he is zany. That said, it is a simple enough framework that I think it will work to model the sort of movie arc you are after. No guidance for when and how to use the four special scenes is sort of weak. But props for keeping it simple and trusting your players.<br/><br/><b>Graham: </b>The traits are good: characters defined by a single trait is a recipe for comedy. Here, there are two characters defined by two traits, one of which they share. Perfect for a buddy movie.<br/><br/>You can\u2019t just say \u201cBe funny or you\u2019re cheating\u201d! That\u2019s not a comedy mechanic!<br/><br/>How would that central mechanic work? You\u2019d bounce between success and failure, failing often, succeeding only occasionally. But failures in these movies are complex things: you fail when it\u2019s embarrassing; you succeed only at wild and crazy schemes.<br/><br/>The best thing is making a situation worse with your trait. That shouldn\u2019t just be an option. That should be the basis of the whole mechanic.<br/><br/>The Fail Die is kinda thrown in. It\u2019s basically an oracle for comic situations. I like it.<br/><br/>Fun idea. Light and simple. I appreciate all that. Not convinced on the central mechanic, but overall, it\u2019s neatly done.<br/><br/><b>Eero: </b>I started liking the writing style, but it got pretentious through the first page. Luckily the author reined himself in once he got into the rules proper.<br/><br/>The game itself belongs in the school of comedy that basically tells you to be funny yourself. \u201cIf you\u2019re not being funny, you\u2019re breaking the rules\u201d as the text puts it. It\u2019s debatable whether this is sufficient advice on the matter, but I\u2019m inclined to think that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence - the game text doesn\u2019t do much to convince me that the author\u2019s faith in self-created comedy over actual game design is justified.<br/><br/>That aside, and assuming players who are ready to bring the funny, my main concern is that I don\u2019t quite see how the pacing of the game is necessarily correct. By this I mean that while the game has pacing in the form of tick marks next to traits, I don\u2019t see why the moment there are two marks next to each trait would necessarily be a good moment for the falling out scene. Perhaps the point is to just have a measurable pacing device the players can see and work towards, but I\u2019m left to wonder whether something more could be done in this regard.<br/><br/>It\u2019s also a shame that there are no separate rules for when the characters are working together and when they\u2019re not - the meaning of falling out and getting back together is strictly narrative and does not actually reflect to the mechanics. This seems like an opportunity lost when the topic is buddy movie.<br/><br/>A separate major concern is the fact that the game does not offer any structure or tools for providing coherent adversity and dramatic arcs. This type of comedy requires a semblance of a plot and colorful secondary characters, so this seems like a clear lack. Of course not insurmountable if the players are up to creating everything themselves without structure, but that\u2019s a pretty heavy requirement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279830/#Comment_279830" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:42:58+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:42AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:24PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Come one, come all</b><br/><br/><b>Eero:</b> Brutally enough the actual game text is just one page slotted in after 17 pages of flavour text. I\u2019m skipping the flavour for now, let\u2019s see if the game text makes any sense in isolation...<br/><br/>The game itself seems to be a story duel between augur/scientists debating the provenance of a mysterious artefact. The idea is that the currently authoritative \u201cexpert\u201d invents stuff about the item under examination, after which his claims are then taken through a gauntlet of contrary claims. \u201cAuthority stones\u201d are used to measure the credibility of each player as experts on the item in question. Unfortunately I don\u2019t quite perceive the motivations behind the players\u2019 actions - it seems that insofar as you want to end up the authority, you should always deny all inputs by other players and take the matter to randomization (by a magic 8-ball, no less).<br/><br/>Intrigued by this glimpse I skimmed the flavour stuff and found more descriptions of the game proper. The account starting on page 6 seems to have most of the pertinent stuff in it. Most significantly, we get a description of the mysterious sacred parchments not explained in the rules flowchart: the players get to write down some facts about the object of examination before play proper begins, thus preparing his position on the item and providing some structure for the debate.<br/><br/>My overall impression is that the game has potential as a party game, but it\u2019s been written in a nigh-hopeless manner. I like the idea of inventing stories about a weird curio, and the rules mechanics seem basically functional enough for a playtest. Not much roleplay to it, but the potential for comedy seems relatively high, as the players establish ironic \u201cfacts\u201d about the artefact, the history of which they might actually know perfectly well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279832/#Comment_279832" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:43:40+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:43AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:24PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>La Commedia</b><br/><br/><b>Graham: </b>Comedy as Commedia dell\u2019arte. How wonderful.<br/><br/>Lots of good stuff here. I like the masks. I like the way players can change masks. (There should actually be masks on the gaming table.)<br/><br/>The Apocalypse World mechanics aren\u2019t quite working for me. Surely your mask, in Commedia dell\u2019arte, shouldn\u2019t simply give you +2. It should define who you are. If you\u2019re Il Capitano, you don\u2019t just get +2 for boasting. You boast all the time. You\u2019re incapable of doing anything else.<br/><br/>I want more details about how hell works. Interestingly, I feel the Fronts mechanics from Apocalypse World would work well here.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, where are the ingredients? Sure, we said we wouldn\u2019t complain about bad ingredient use, but I can\u2019t find any of them here. Perhaps you were so inspired by comedy that you didn\u2019t need anything else. Still. Dude.<br/><br/>All that said, it\u2019s a workable game with comedy as Commedia dell\u2019arte, and that\u2019s good for me.<br/><br/><b>Jason: </b>I love the notion of turning an existing game engine into something that can sort of run Commedia. I\u2019m not sure this is it, but points for going there. It feels like the Commedia tropes are fighting with the AW rules in an imperfect fit. I have a hard time seeing what we would actually do at the table - this is definitely undercooked but  very promising. Not using a single one of the ingredients is a bold choice!<br/><br/><b>Eero: </b>The topic is excellent, but making it an Apocalypse World hack is not a long-sighted choice; it\u2019s a funny in-joke, but not necessarily good game design. That being said, this is one of the stronger statements on comedy among the contest participants.<br/><br/>I\u2019m torn on the game overall, as the power of the topic clearly overwhelms the design, but then on the other hand it\u2019s also nice to read a short game text instead of the boring long-winded ones. In the final consideration I have to say that I would have liked to see this author create a full-blown game of Commedia with an original rules system - perhaps with the sweeping hellish adventure context, perhaps not - the topic has plenty of meat for this and more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279833/#Comment_279833" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:44:28+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:25PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Jin</b><br/><br/><b>Graham:</b> Divine beings stuck on Earth, forced to worry about human things.

Under Promises, you mention Jin Eh Mok. Really confusing.<br/><br/>What would a game of Jin look like? Would my character be getting a job and trying to do it well? I don\u2019t know.<br/><br/>There\u2019s one basic mechanic: you roll a die when you take damage. I need more than that. Give me some pushback, something that makes unexpected things happen. It can come from other players or from failed die rolls, but it\u2019s got to be there.<br/><br/>Overall: great idea. A superb and unusual comic set-up. I want to see it carried through into the mechanics.<br/><br/><b>Jason</b>: I don\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s going on with this game. The presentation works against it. The rules seem to be of the mother may I variety, drifting into parlor narration. Promises vs. Powers, OK, I can see where that could become amusing. Please explain something before referencing it - your readers do not live inside your brain.<br/><br/><b>Eero:</b> I like many of the things here. I would have expected random tables for powers and promises in a comedy game. The Allah-degreed secret oathbreaking-hitpoints are amusing. The healt rolls are a very well-thought idea, they deserve further development.<br/><br/>Contest-wise it\u2019s rather a problem that the comedy is not very obvious. This is grim, World of Darkness level grimdark stuff. People you provide with wishes get eaten by monsters from beyond space and time, for instance. Maybe it\u2019s supposed to be black humour - greedy mortals meeting poetic ends or something like that. Still, I would have liked to see more human empathy in this, comedy in the sense of uplifting, calming feel-good experience. The whole premise reminds me of the common comedy manga trope where godlike beings end up living among humans, often in the homes of humans, while encountering humanity and learning to live with them and love them - that\u2019s the sort of thing you should facilitate here, not bitter choices between getting screwed now or later.<br/><br/>I do see potential for comedy, but I suspect that players might take it as a mere GM screwjob when he insists that their characters can\u2019t do anything right. I see the role of system in this sort of game as a way for the GM to keep the weight of responsibility off his own shoulders, and this seems to be something that the game fails at: will you really have the balls to screw with the players all the time without having any sort of game system to back your deeds?<br/><br/>Also, there is no real system for adjudicating consequences - this is a GM fiat game all the way. As it is, the promise hitpoints are the only thing that is keeping the player characters alive, to pick an example.<br/><br/>I like everything this game has, but it needs more before it\u2019s really swinging: randomized chargen fits like a glove here, and there needs to be some way of gaining more hitpoints (succeeding in an episode with a happy, Allah-pleasing ending seems like a fine way in this), and you need some way of establishing humans and such in a non-arbitrary manner - you want to do fantasy comedy in this game, that\u2019s not going to happen without an excellent group dynamic or more structure to the game. Also, most definitely there needs to be some way of gaining new powers dynamically during play, and that way needs to be interesting, fraught with dicing and funny perils of ill-thought promises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279834/#Comment_279834" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:45:24+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:45AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:25PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Quite Indubitably</b><br/><br/><b>Graham: </b>That\u2019s a difficult writing style. I skipped the first page. Even afterwards, it\u2019s extremely wordy, like wading through froth. Which is a shame, because that aside, it\u2019s well-structured.<br/><br/>I like it. It\u2019s parlour narration, basically a parlour game, in which I try to incorporate silly words into an ongoing story. That\u2019s fun.<br/><br/>This feels as though it should be a simple game: so why cards and dice? You could do this whole game just with cards. And probably without a character sheet.<br/><br/>Oh, God, Princess Collins.  Where on Earth does that name come from? Certainly not England.<br/><br/>Nice to see Kings are exceptionally eloquent, while Queens are nagging aunts and screaming babies. I\u2019ll just call you Mr Patriarchy.<br/><br/>But it\u2019s good. It\u2019s fun. Simplify it and I\u2019d enjoy playing.<br/><br/><b>Jason:</b> I like the diction cards. The rules are needlessly complicated parlor narration. The tone and presentation are wearing.<br/><br/><b>Eero:</b> The rules seem to assume that the players care about the fiction despite giving the fiction no manner of influence on the proceedings. This is typical of parlor narration games - I\u2019ve come to see it as a designer preference, some people are just that motivated about storytelling. This reflects on all the design choices in the game, beginning with the fact that your narration has no influence on your dice pool.<br/><br/>The most damning fact about the game from my viewpoint is that the fictional topic is not supremely endearing. A bit of curiousity is piqued by the way the topic and conditions of discussion are randomized out of a deck for the players to compete over, but this isn\u2019t really enough to carry the whole game when the actual fiction has no impact on the proceedings.<br/><br/>The matter of parlor narration aside, it seems to me that the game has a reasonable relationship with the king of the genre, <i>Once Upon a Time</i>. The Diction cards need to be replaced with some mechanic that makes for less random-access searching, though - perhaps only allow the player to access the top five terms on the card at a time or something to make the game less about scanning the card and more about fitting a square peg in a round hole in an amusing manner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279835/#Comment_279835" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:46:35+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:46AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:25PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Shaken</b><br/><br/><b>Graham: </b>I love the set-up: an average holidaymaker becomes convinced they\u2019re James Bond.

But I like randomly-generated silliness. It reminds me of Toon. (This is a compliment).<br/><br/>I like the timer. Not sure about the bidding: perhaps it could work. The ends of the scene are phrased just right: receive an indication that the mission is proceeding badly/successfully.<br/><br/>And it\u2019s an hour-long game. Neat.

Anything like that would help me get excited about actually playing the game - as it is this is solid, but there is no excitement caused by the exploration of the unknown. I don\u2019t doubt the comedic potential, but as it is the game feels a bit too tightly scoped.

However I love the idea of a color-heavy, richly realized, extremely goofy sandbox to play in.<br/><br/>\u201cHelp from your starfish\u201d and immediately thereafter \u201cInvolving bondage\u201d is a nice juxtaposition.<br/><br/><b>Eero:</b> The dicing system is weird. Insofar as I can see, you want to have as many dice as possible for both yourself and the dealer, except that your own dice have a linear effect on your number of successes while the dealer\u2019s dice get a sharply decreasing return. And then all this is mixed up by the special rules such as Infectious Craziness.<br/><br/>The setting is great, sort of psychedelic hippy Americana in space.

I'll be honest, I had *no idea* how to approach writing a comedy game, and I tried to steer away from my first impulse of parody/normal game in a zany setting. So I took the cheap way out and went for emulating a comedic genre. <br/><br/>I agree that I went too far into the 'do your own thing' camp, but that was an exaggeration of a conscious choice. I have a tendency to make up super detailed rules for everything, and I wanted to force myself not to do that.

On pages 4 to 5, you give scripted scenes for each character in turn. (They look really fun). Some of these say \u201craise the Ticket to Level One\u201d (a forward reference, please don\u2019t do this).<br/><br/>Then, pages 5 to 6, there\u2019s the Ticket section, which gives scenes that happen when the Ticket changes level. But...wait...the Ticket changed level in those initial scenes...so how does that work? Do these scenes interrupt the scripted scenes we\u2019ve just talked about? I genuinely don\u2019t understand how to play.<br/><br/>Ah, Physical, Mental and Social Traits. I can\u2019t get enough of them.<br/><br/>The Act Two chapter is seriously hampered by back and forward referencing: \u201cplaces a bet (page 9)\u201d. So it\u2019s hard to understand. Again, it\u2019s a shame, because this looks great: a resolution system that involves everyone at the table.<br/><br/>Act Three looks really fun. A lottery to determine who gets the ticket. Wonderful.<br/><br/>Overall, I like this and want to understand it. It\u2019s Reservoir Dogs done as comedy. Character creation is great. The mechanics look fun. It\u2019s probably a good game.<br/><br/><b>Jason:</b> OK, Sebastian Hickey, how would this work? It is highly structured, seems like it would flow well, my eyes glazed over at the terminology. It seems like it will require substantial investment - system mastery, all new terms, a tightly regimented sequence of play. It is what it is. Will it be humorous in play? That\u2019s the big question for the author, Mr. Sebastian Hickey. I think it has all the right ingredients for that.<br/><br/><b>Eero:</b> The fictional premise is again super-narrow: the player characters are retired super-spies looking for a missing winning lottery ticket. I sort of like the scenario, even if I don\u2019t get excited by the extreme narrowness and the consequent lack of creative potential.<br/><br/>I could see a good comedy film with this premise, but playing it out seems a bit pointless - I can already see the funny turns without gathering my group to play this out. The mechanical system is elaborate, but it seems out of place with the game\u2019s simple fictional premise. Still, this is a personal gripe, the game itself seems basically well-structured. It should also be funny, I can appreciate this sort of darkish and desperate comedy hijinks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279841/#Comment_279841" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:58:19+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:58AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:27PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Big Tuna</b><br/><br/><b>Graham:</b> I wondered, when I read this, why all the players were playing Max Tuna. Why would that be fun? Then I read the original game, at the back, which has everyone playing James Bond. That makes much more sense.<br/><br/>I like the parts of the brain vying for control of 007. I don\u2019t like the tight story structure: unless these are done well, they can kill a game. The bad guy has way too much authority.<br/><br/>It\u2019s parlour narration, but it\u2019s a fun idea and I like the way everyone plays Bond.<br/><br/><b>Jason:</b> Southern-fried pastiche. Highly structured, everybody plays one dude which is interesting. Author hastily reskinned it (leaving in at least one \u201cspy\u201d) but it hardly matters. He showed his work, anyway. Says it is GMless but it isn\u2019t, \u201cmother may I\u201d mechanic. I really like the idea of the various factions in the protagonists head arguing - that could be really funny - but it is pasted into a game that is pretty limp. I can\u2019t tell if the author is southern and diving into conscious parody of outsider perceptions of southern-ness or ... not from around here.<br/><br/><b>Eero: </b>Everybody playing a single character certainly is comedy gold, and a pretty unique type of comedy characteristic of roleplaying, too. I don\u2019t know if the reasonableness test is necessary, especially with 2d6 - the bell curve might not feel satisfactory, and it seems potentially unfunny to have your input get shot down by the dice. On the other hand, I find the set-up with the Tunas picking and choosing partially overlapping story pieces with another player doing re-narration to be a fine recipe for comedy. This needs to be rethought, but the core is solid.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t like the act structure, and the game would benefit from making Tuna struggle with the world around him instead of making the players roll dice for whether they get to say their piece. Aside from that, the kernel seems really strong to me - this could be a very funny game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279843/#Comment_279843" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T11:58:50+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 11:58AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 12:27PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Hangover</b><br/><br/><b>Graham:</b> I like retracing Bond\u2019s steps in reverse chronological order, Memento-style.

I\u2019m glad to see a roleplaying game that plays like a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>The comedy lies in the situation. However, I\u2019m sure the mechanics facilitate comedy. Some mechanics seem to work against it: comedy is, to some extent, about unexpected failure, but Otherkind dice let you choose your failure. The Blasphemy rules might be pretty funny, though.<br/><br/>Ah, Physical, Mental and Social traits. They\u2019re in everything. Put Piety in there or something.<br/><br/>Overall, though, it\u2019d be fun to play.

The only straight-up humor emerging from mechanics here is Blasphemy, which I could see being really fun in play. The setup is certainly distinctive, and leaves me a little at sea as to what I need to be doing at the table. Easily remedied post-contest I imagine.<br/><br/><b>Eero</b>: I like the setting, although it could be played a bit more Paranoid. The rules system is bland and, most damningly, non-comedic: nothing in particular encourages comedy here.

It\u2019s comedy through etiquette, forcing the players to follow silly rules while speaking. Perfect. There are nice touches: I like the inanimate object that\u2019s the Starfish ambassador.<br/><br/>I\u2019d prefer a more open game, without a GM-figure, in which any player can upbraid another for breaking a rule.

The speaking rules would be daunting and suitably challenging, perhaps too much so - I could see ways to tune it to group preference and ability  pretty easily. Escalating speech rules would, I think, cripple the game in short order as written. I love the Assistant\u2019s role - great fun.

That makes me deeply happy.<br/><br/>So, it\u2019s comedy-as-sitcom and it\u2019s done well. I like that players play classes of NPCs that the alien might meet (classes that are, of course, based on sitcom personalities). Rolling on a table to create misunderstandings is inspired. Let\u2019s try that now: a couple kissing in a cinema is interpreted as...well, um, I rolled \u201cEarth and its animal and plant inhabitants\u201d. Actually, I can\u2019t fit that in.

The randomness seems perfectly balanced - I\u2019d tweak the category results to skew the game even more toward sitcom tropes, but that\u2019s a personal preference. My impulse would be to be ruthless about keeping it mundane, prosaic, inane. The fact that I am obsessing about ways to adjust the game speaks volumes - I really like  it!<br/><br/><b>Eero</b>: A strong concept. The sitcom metaphor skirts on constraining, but mostly it leaves the players free to explore the situation and its implications. I like the campaign structure. No real weaknesses aside from the lack of systemic ambition - the game\u2019s built of relatively conventional blocks. But then, if that\u2019s what it takes to succeed, I won\u2019t complain.<br/><br/>The potential for comedic misunderstanding is obvious, as are the opportunities for colorful, one-dimensional sitcom characters. Something to keep the tone from slipping might be required in serious development, but perhaps those rules for Visitor influence on conflicts will ensure a happy ending for most stories - who knows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279852/#Comment_279852" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T12:16:48+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 12:16PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, that's all the games.

The funny thing to me is the totally opposite reactions that Graham and Eero had.  Graham totally got why it's a comedy game.  Although in my mind it's really a light-hearted drama.  The fact that Eero went to Hannibal Lecter, Arkham Asylum and Psychological Thriller kind of fascinates me.  To me The Deluded is supposed to be philosophically charming, like Don Quixote.  In fact the game title is a quote from a film called They Might Be Giants which in turn is a play on Don Quixote.  The title refers to penicillin and the quote from which it comes is all about how if we never thought of crazy things we'd never advance as a society.<br/><br/>The central question of the game is that maybe, JUST MAYBE this crazy guy is better therapy for the patients than the doctor.  Hell, maybe he's better therapy for the doctor himself.  Because maybe, just maybe, Bread Mold Might Be Medicine.<br/><br/>I admit I kind of shot myself in the foot with my own examples.  I talked to Paul Czege about how I don't write very evocative examples.  He suggested an alternative Deluded to me who believed himself to be a bumblebee pollinating flowers in a Narnia like dream world.  <br/><br/>However the fact that Eero saw the potential for psychological thriller in the game makes me wonder if perhaps the game is broader in its application than originally intended.  Along those lines I have considered opening up the games scope a bit because I realized that all you need is an Institution, an Authority of that Institution and an Outsider with an orthogonal philosophy.  For example I imagined a coffee house setting.  The Doctor is the owner and the Patients are the regular customers.  The Deluded then becomes the "new guy" who arrives and stirs up trouble with his skewed world view.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for the feedback.  Oh it's funny that Jason mentions that the game could be 50% smaller.  There are two things along this line.<br/><br/>1) I realized I could have scaled the game back to just the doctor and the deluded.  But I didn't want this to be a two player game like S/lay w/ Me or Sweet Agatha.<br/><br/>2) The game was originally much simpler.  For example my first draft had just one currency.  But I found myself shoe-horning that currency in uncomfortable ways that didn't really represent the thematic flow of the narrative.  So a few bits got expanded.  I think this draft represents an optimal first pass.  But you're right, only playtesting will tell.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279857/#Comment_279857" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T12:32:44+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 12:32PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congrats to everyone!

I wondered myself about whether I should categorize it as a 'roleplaying' game, since it is very different from most of those I've seen, but with the entirety of play being in-character dialog I ended up deciding that I couldn't not call it one myself.  And I was concerned from the beginning about playability, but I've been in and seen some long-established Mao groups and so have a fairly high opinion of people's ability to keep track of a large set of silly rules when playing a game, and giving the other players rewards for pointing out rule-breaks was added originally to take pressure off of the assistant role, although I think it has other good effects as well.  Like you said, it's fairly easy to tweak (number of starting rules, new rules could be when two filibusters are completed in a row or based on the number of players at a given point level instead if there get to be too many)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279861/#Comment_279861" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T12:52:00+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 12:52PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>However the fact that Eero saw the potential for psychological thriller in the game makes me wonder if perhaps the game is broader in its application than originally intended.

I find nothing in the comments to disagree with. Though, personally, I would have been a bit more harsh on it. For example, on its utter failure to really explain its basic premise, or even have one in the first place. And, nothing really says "comedy" like simplistic organic chemistry. And, like Eero said, I was so obsessed with figuring out how a group plays together with molecular models, I more or less forgot to write an actual game.<br/><br/>Still, I am glad of the exercise.<br/><br/>Graham asked questions, likely rhetorical, but I will answer them anyway:\n<ul><li>Do I want to play this game? I want to play the version in my head, but only with certain people. I would definitely not want to play it with certain others (even though I'd play other games with them in a heartbeat). Sadly, the version in my head bears little resemblance to what I actually wrote down. But, even playing with the version in my head, with the "certain people", I'm not sure it would avoid the "dull as hell" curse.</li><li>Is Molymod essential? No. You can tell it isn't because the purposes for which it is used (basically for tracking certain things) could easily be done with something else. (Well, maybe the mad grab wouldn't really be the same with other tools.) Still, I think there is something in the notion of using molecular models in a story game that could be cool. Haven't quite put my finger on it, though.</li><li>GenCon? Sorry, won't be there. Even if I was, I'm not sure I really understand what I was trying to do enough to explain it anyway, which certainly shows in the submitted result.</li></ul>\nAnother regret I have is waiting until fairly far along in the process to start thinking about carbon-carbon bonds (that is, connections directly between players, and what that might mean). I have a sneaking suspicion that, if there is a real game in Valance, it lies in there someplace. By the time I had a decent idea about it, though, I only had a few hours left.<br/><br/>I also wonder if the first idea I had for the contest (about reminiscing junk-bond traders on vacation) would have worked better. Nah. Knowing me I probably would have based on the mechanics on compound interest, or the LIBOR, or something.<br/><br/>By the way, I'll likely be releasing this version of Valence under a "do whatever you want with it" Creative Commons license, so anyone who wants to mutate it into something actually playable can do so. I'll post a link in this thread when that is done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GamerChris" title="GamerChris"><img alt="GamerChris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GamerChris">GamerChris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279864/#Comment_279864" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T13:23:18+00:00" title="July  9, 2010  1:23PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote 6 Degrees of Resolution, which is the first game I've written since middle school.  I really appreciate the comments all of you gave, and I totally agree with most all of them.  In fact, I got to playtest it on the day before submission, which totally revealed many of its flaws, but I didn't have time to really revise it by then.<br/><br/>Just a couple of thoughts about the comments:<br/><br/>Jason - In our play, it was actually the LDO who had less fun.  Since they didn't have a real "stake" in the scene or even a mood to play out, they tended to just sit back and watch while the other players argued and made stuff up and had fun.  In some ways, it felt sort of like the party game Who Would Win?, where the LDO was just the judge.  <br/><br/>Graham and Eero - Yeah, coherence was a big problem.  I had the idea for the random tables because if I was going to have these brief little scenes involving (for the most part) different characters in each, I wanted a way to give the players a loaded gun as far as characterization and scene framing went.  But, as you pointed out, the situations were too zany and random to work with in many cases.  In our playtest, we also discovered that some personas and moods just didn't work well to drive action.  Being numb or lethargic just makes for a pretty uninvolved character.<br/><br/>All of you - Yeah, the d30 is definitely gimmicky.  It came about because I started to brainstorm moods and such, and got somewhere between 20 and 30.  "Heck," I said, "I have  d30, so let's just use that!"  So I added in more and used it rather than editing and using something more reasonable.  <br/><br/>But I really enjoyed myself, and I found both the process and the participation with reading the other entries to be a lot of fun.

Many thanks to all judges and contestants for the encouraging comments and feedback. I was floored by the quality and variety of the other games submitted, and feel flattered just to have had my slightly cheesy offering treated as though it belongs in such august company.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled that you guys would like to see it further developed. With an eye toward possibly doing so, here are a few initial questions for the judges.<br/><br/><b>Graham</b>: I think I agree with you in principle that the transitions between encounters (e.g. from the beach to the ventilation shaft) are a little feeble - I wasn't too satisfied with just saying "The Bond player is responsible for getting his character from scene to scene," but within the time constraints of the contest I couldn't think of anything cleverer. Anyone have any suggestions?<br/><br/><b>Jason</b>: I was genuinely puzzled by your remark that the bidding mechanism is parlor narration, especially given that the idea of determining whether a scene goes either "well" or "badly" <i>in medias res</i> is one that I basically <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">stole</span>...um...<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">borrowed</span>...let's say <i>adapted</i> from <i>Fiasco</i>. It still strikes me as imposing only the very most minimal constraint on how each scene comes out. Could you maybe elaborate a little on why you thought this?<br/><br/><b>Eero</b>: Campaign mode? Really? For a game based on the "he got bumped on the head" conceit? I am deeply flattered but utterly mystified. Please explain further, and I promise  to reward you with your very own <i>Story of O</i> mission table for private delectation.<br/><br/>Thanks again, all,<br/>Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279869/#Comment_279869" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T13:44:02+00:00" title="July  9, 2010  1:44PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2010 1:44PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mark (and everybody),<br/><br/>Feel free to spawn a new thread, here or at Praxis, if you want to dig into your game. To answer your question - I don't think the bidding mechanic in Shaken (a game whose bones are strong and which I quite like) is going to have a strong bearing on the fiction (it determines outcomes, but so does flipping a coin).

Space Cowboys has a <i>dark history</i> though, it is actually the third in a trilogy of Holiday themed comedy RPGs I've built in design contests. It's brethren are <a href="http://wyrmwood.mmo-report.com/RPGs/ChristmasNinjas.pdf" rel="nofollow">Christmas Ninjas</a>(pdf) and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8635&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Valentine Knights</a>. <br/><br/>Far from a reskinning, Space Cowboys, unlike the other two, has no GM, because really, would Space Cowboys let anyone tell them what to do? It also changes some significant things in the dice mechanics, so while I'm pretty sure that things will work from how the basic system has worked with Christmas Ninjas and Valentine Knights in the past, I take Eero's concerns to heart about how Infectious Crazy could impact things. <br/><br/>I have trouble in making my rules text more understandable (both Jason and Eero mentioned this...), which is especially frustrating because my mechanics tend to be subtly unusual. In play, folks over the age of ten seem to pick it up after a few rolls. Perhaps I should describe the demonstration process, where "you split the dealer's roll into the three types (ignoring any type that wasn't rolled), and then set up the cowboy's roll along side each. Then the smallest pile that the cowboy has is her number of successes, keeping in mind the smallest pile might have no dice in it."<br/><br/>Jason, you are absolutely right about too many words ending in g, and Wraslin' is what Roughing ought to be called. Technically I'm allowed to do that too, as a second generation Texas emigrant.<br/><br/>Graham, the relationship between Trouble and the Tale (and, you know actually defining what those are) is something that I imply all over but never really state. In retrospect it belongs near the beginning. That I didn't include one was my one regret from after I posted my game.<br/><br/>Eero, I'm glad you enjoyed the more substantive side of the setting. While the world of the cowboys and their peculiar mindset is intended to be silly it is also intended to be uncomfortable. Humour that cannot express some depth just doesn't feel right to me. Of course sometimes the jokes write themselves in this respect, did you notice that Vatican City and Iran share the same Independence Day?<br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to getting Space Cowboys into playtesting, I've got my two regular groups interested at this point, so it should just be a matter of time.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279879/#Comment_279879" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T14:30:52+00:00" title="July  9, 2010  2:30PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um.

So, out goes the whole good days/bad days thing, but maybe some kind of scoring related to how many items you can recall from your baggage...?

Mystics who simply decided to accept the fact that it was all smoke and mirrors, and they had just been pretending all along.<br/><br/>What else could we use besides dice?<br/><br/>What could we tell stories about?<br/><br/>Do we have to play the roles of protagonists within those stories, or can we take on the roles of communal storytellers arguing over a tale?<br/><br/>I knew it wasn't going to be an easy read. Especially when I decided to incorporate the "actual play" and the FAQ section into the beginning as a narrative from the perspective of an late 19th century anthropologist. I guess I'm trying to move beyond that idea of game rules in one part of the text, and setting in another part of the text. Some documents have done this successfully, but in a rather pedestrian manner...I was trying to push the envelope a bit further.<br/><br/>I guess that's the problem when my mind is a churning primordial soup of ideas at the moment, then Little Game Chef comes along with a set of ingredients that catalyse that soup in an instant.<br/><br/>I end up typing stuff out in a stream of conscious manner, regardless of the length...not fathoming whether anyone else is along for the ride.<br/><br/>Thanks for the comments Eero, I know it still needs a lot of refinement. But it's good to see that someone thinks it's a generally playable concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279948/#Comment_279948" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T02:17:23+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  2:17AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's really amazing to see all the hard work put into this.

On one hand, la commedia dell'arte was the first thing that came to my mind with this contest, and I still really want to follow that game idea through. So I have this huge joy that you actually went there. But to me, I was much less enamored with specific masks and far more with the way the comedy was punctuated with the Lazzi. And when I couldn't see them I was made sad...<br/><br/>But I could see some mapping of the traditional mask Lazzi into the moves under each mask. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279994/#Comment_279994" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T15:05:24+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  3:05PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a pretty interesting Danish scenario commedia dell'arte scenario some years back, using masks and lazzi.

Good luck with the development process!<br/><br/>Thanks for commenting on my entry, especially since I broke the cardinal rule. It was a template problem. Nothing more to be said on that.\n<blockquote>I genuinely don\u2019t understand how to play.</blockquote>\nHi Graham, thanks for digging through the text. Yes, the forward referencing. Schoolboy error. Your comments are very helpful. It's easy to forget how hard it is for me to explain simple (but new concepts) simply. Great work on this competition! Sorry to have frustrated.\n<blockquote>Will it be humorous in play?</blockquote>\nHi Jason. Again, thanks for the feedback. Too many new terms, too many new rules. If I familiarise the terminology and present the rules in digestible layers, there is hope. I was aiming for a kind of play-as-you-go document. I'm still aiming. As for the big question, while writing another game I found a happy accident and I tried to use that accident again. It all came from Hell for Leather (HfL), which I'd intended for broodiness and excess, but ended with laughter and excess. HfL delivers comedy. It is a funny game. Part of the humour comes from surprise, and the other part comes from creative antagonism. In Syndicate, I wanted to explore creative antagonism as a method for delivering unpredictable, escalating adversity.<br/><br/>The intention was for a group of players to contribute to a narrative for each of their characters in turn. One player presents a character in action and the other players add layers of action on top. For example, player 1 "steals the ticket from the caf\xe9," player 2 tells him that "his wife is at a table at the caf\xe9 being seduced by his ex-boss." Now player 1 retorts that he "breaks up the dinner by 'accidentally' pushing a food trolley at their table, knocking soup all over the man's trousers." Maybe player 3 adds a twist, saying that "when he goes to push the trolley, he lights his own trousers on fire." Player 4 announces that "the fire activates the alarm, causing a downpour and mayhem." The scene resolution rules handle what happens here and what happens to the ticket.<br/><br/>Okay, not so funny written down. But quite funny if spontaneous and, importantly, collectively generated like this <i>at the table</i>. I understand that a series of escalating narrative injections will create unforeseen outcomes and, if done collectively and piecemeal, will appeal to the group's sense of humour. Furthermore, I understand that the backstabbing and chicanery (where in one scene you support a player and in another you oppose him) will create good-natured rivalry (inspiring more twisted and memorable dilemmas. So, the comedy, for me, comes from surprise and antagonism.\n<blockquote>lack of creative potential.</blockquote>\nHi Eero. Thanks for the feedback. This is something I have struggled with. When does creative constraint become creative hindrance? And all that. In this case, for Syndicate, I'm not at all as anxious about the lack of creative potential. The game's backdrop is open to interpretation (three Russians in New York, space spies in the pirate quadrant, geriatric spies, spurned lovers reunited, and so on). Their objective, to find the ticket, remains consistent, but no more constrained, I'd say, than Montsegur 1244, for example.\n<blockquote>I could see a good comedy film with this premise, but playing it out seems a bit pointless - I can already see the funny turns without gathering my group to play this out. </blockquote>\nI'm not sure, either, that the game rules support a very predictable outcome. If you start the game thinking of your character as a cool Russian spy but your friend wants to screw with you, you might end up a partially blind, alcoholic ballet instructor. That's probably a funnier and more itneresting story than you had intended.

M1244 is one of the most constrained games that I've seen that still manages to be engaging.<br/><br/>Second of all, I think Syndicate is more constrained. Montsegur lets you decide what you want, and what you do. Making decisions about what is important to you... well, that's kind of a driving force in the game, I think. Where is that choice in Syndicate? I want the lotto ticket. The alternative choices (do I abandon the search?) seem pretty insincere.<br/><br/>Not being able to determine your own goals makes this game constrained in a non-engaging way. I, as a player, think lotteries are stupid, and greed is lame. Where do we go from there?

"Threes" is my fault. I think the notes about the game being over-structured are spot on. I gave myself just a few hours to cook up something based off the Rule of Threes, and this is what resulted\u2014but it's structured too much, in an effort to make sure there was a game there and not just a premise. As it is, I'm pretty sure it doesn't work now and won't get the development time to be made into something that does work for quite a while.<br/><br/>One gag, which doesn't come across in the text, is that it's a game of a rigidly edited film sequence: the three suspects talking to the camera, cut together in little segments, setting each other up for little jokes and unexpected doses of information. The suspects are each locked away in separate rooms, and it's funny mostly to the Interrogator, who watches these guys turn on each other as their story slowly comes together. The fact that the suspects cannot yell across the table at each other is, therefore, by design. The suspects are trying to keep their story straight without any ability to check in with each other\u2014all they can do is pile on the information and hope. <br/><br/>The sentence-counting mechanism is there, in part, to give the dice more value, and also to keep the characters from saying nothing, as a good suspect would. It's a gross, ill-thought-out mechanism, though.

It's a party game with too much structure to turn into the sort of story that freer roleplaying can produce.  I'm okay with that, as it suits what I'd be in the mood for via roleplaying comedy.  I think one of the untapped potentials for comedy in roleplaying is exactly that -- party games with few weighty responsibilities.  Kind of an RPG icebreaker for newcomers.  And a game easy enough to play drunk.<br/><br/>Jason, regarding your comment about the rules not contributing much: <br/><br/>I had the situation, cards, and roles all in mind first.  I wrote it down, looked at it, and thought, "Uh oh, folks will be aimlessly adrift without something to organize play as a whole."  That's the only reason I came up with a formal system for trying to maximize your chances of a favorable alien review.  My hope was that using up a finite pool of tokens over the course of the whole game would unite the otherwise disparate workers' performance reviews.  "Are you saving all your tokens for Brad's turn, or just being a jerk and looking out for yourself?" etc.<br/><br/>If you have any suggestions for other mechanical directions I could have gone in, I'd love to hear 'em.  My personal taste is a bit less structured than Rat Race, but aimlessness is a major fear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280148/#Comment_280148" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T13:45:13+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  1:45PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, judges, thank you for all the thought and text you've devoted to this.

I found it very interesting that my own gut reaction favoured the former strongly - I was excited about <i>Jinn</i>, for instance, while Syndicate, probably somewhat technically better in terms of concerned design, felt less creatively exciting as a prospect of play. Then again, it seems that this creative "choking" doesn't concern the range of boardgamey stuff like <i>Rat Race</i>, <i>Quite Indubitably</i>, <i>Baggage Carousel</i> and, above others, <i>Starfish Ambassador</i>. I suspect that a lot has to do with the requirements the game sets for me as a player: there is a choke-point in between a freely ranging roleplaying game and a boardgame that uses the fiction merely as a flavourful prop, a point of parlor narration where the game requires you to put immense creative energy into detailing a setting, characters and activities that are regardless strongly predictated by the game's system, causing you to work hard for no more than the privilege of narrating. I found this a reigning theme in the contest and caught myself wishing for more games with traditional creative scope and less of the ones that specify a carefully preplotted structure of play. Time will tell if what I'm seeing is a genuine and common trend in what people want out of roleplaying, or if this is just a passing idiosyncracy on my part.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough the jury was all but unanimous in our preferences this time around, a clearly different case from the last year's competition. I could and would and did pick all of our recommended picks myself, for instance, and I understand that we all agreed on the winner facilely and without needing a debate. No idea if this means anything.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>Campaign mode? Really? For a game based on the "he got bumped on the head" conceit? I am deeply flattered but utterly mystified. Please explain further, and I promise  to reward you with your very own<i>Story of O</i>mission table for private delectation.</blockquote>\n<i>Shaken</i> is a good example of the phenomenon I struggle with above - the game seems to me like a basically functional engine block with a missing spark plug, it needs <i>something</i> more... this something could be clear stakes that hook the player, thematic uncertainty (perhaps over whether the guy might be <i>right</i> in his delusion), or it could be some sort of campaign mode that roots the events a bit and looks beyond the immediate into the consequences. The temporary amnesia is a relatively incidental thing in this regard, the real conundrum of the design is the matter of how to make the randomized story arc elevate above Exquisite Corpse in terms of creative engagement. The idea of randomizing scenes and then arranging them seems like a fun and functional mechanic, for instance, but it's left awfully trivial without some creative tension. Appeal of "thin" fiction caused by randomness is fine for boardgames and such, but if the game is predicated on us caring for the characters and manipulating the fictional positioning, then it needs a bit more commitment for play to seem meaningful.<br/><br/>I've struggled with this particular idea a bit lately simply because I'm rather uncertain about how much what I'm saying reflects the preferences of others - how common is it for people to simply crave for roleplaying tools that allow them to tell stories and nothing more? <i>Once Upon a Time</i> is clearly the most successful game of this type, but I'm also seeing it all around me when I squint a little. I'm reflecting on Big Model rpg theory here, sort of contrasting narrativist play against the simple joy of being able to speak and be heard - Exploration, simply put. Several games in this contest point towards a creatively simple wish to have the game tell you what to say so that you can then say it, but it's not the only place where I'm encountering this sort of thing: I've been reading some Nordic design lately, and I'm seeing similar inclinations in the work of eg. our own Matthijs Holter - the pleasure of playing the game is simply in the most basic ability of the group to narrate together, with no further ambition to it. There are Finnish designers also who work on this sort of thing - I've been struggling to find a harmonious viewpoint on the works of Karoliina Korppoo, for example. I'm not quite thinking that these games or designs do not have complete creative goals, but their writing puts all the energy into trying to get the players to talk right and cooperate in creating a story, so that the core of the matter, the <i>why</i> of making the story remains unclear - perhaps because the creator wants you to bring your own goals into it, perhaps because he never saw anything in roleplaying beyond the point of functional cooperation. Perhaps I'm just missing something important that would help me understand where this type of design is coming from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280574/#Comment_280574" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T06:06:10+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  6:06AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm answering Eero <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12491" rel="nofollow">over here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280613/#Comment_280613" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T09:25:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  9:25AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted to comment on some of Eero's observations, specifically this idea of parlor narration and what he calls this bunch of "strongly structural story games."  I have noticed that there are a lot of new(ish) games out there that subscribe to a similar design philosophy.  At times I've derisively called it "wind-up toy" design.  I realize that I use that term more as a way to express my personal preferences, and that a lot of people like this type of game (to each his own).<br/><br/>Typically, these games rely on a bunch of structured techniques that move the players through a set of somewhat scripted events.  At the end, you have something you can call a story.  There isn't as much room/need for the hard creative input that more open-ended designs provide.  As a result, it seems to me that the games are less concerned about learning something thematically important about your fellow players as it is about simply sharing a common experience with them (i.e., playing the game).  As Eero puts it, it's about the act of shared narration ("to tell stories and nothing more") more than any other creative goal.<br/><br/>Another common thing I've noticed is that these games all produce similar output with different groups of people.  So if Group A plays the game, they can then talk about their experiences with Group B in a very similar way.  It's not only about sharing the experience with the members of your own group, but about being able to describe a similar experience to everyone else who has played the game.<br/><br/>My questions are somewhat similar to Eero's.  Why the trend toward this "wind-up" type design?  What's the attraction?  Is there a real desire for this type of play?  Is it because it's creatively easier?  Is it a board game influence?<br/><br/>My goal is not to bash anyone here, just to find out what's up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280616/#Comment_280616" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T09:33:11+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  9:33AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>My questions are somewhat similar to Eero's.

I wasn't there, and recently asked him what was so cool about it.  He told me about his acting style, turning off lights for a scene, his colorful NPCs, and the web of city schemes the player characters navigated.<br/><br/>I suggested to him that he made that game fun all on his own, with no help from the Vampire rulebook other than a relatively easy task resolution mechanic.  The game didn't tell him what the characters ought to be doing or caring about.<br/><br/>He responded that the game told the players (and him) to care about creating a certain aesthetic, and as long as they all did that, play was great.  And in presenting that aesthetic clearly and memorably and with a million inspiring examples, the book was extremely valuable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280693/#Comment_280693" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T13:39:43+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  1:39PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just heard from a cohort who might be interested in doing more with <i>Threes</i> as a simple little product, though that would require a fair bit of playtesting.
