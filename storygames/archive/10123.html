I had initially picked up the book based on my excitement about the setting.  It was rich with all kinds of creepy monster stuff, occult WWII bits and the whole trust-as-a-mechanic thing really grabbed my attention.  I read through the book and wrote up a scenario and set out to play.  My group is pretty open-minded.  They've happily accepted every "weird" RPG I tend to throw at them with excitement.  We've played Dogs and Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard and InSpectres but this was the first time that we've all felt let down by an indie game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMainly, I'm posting this because I need to see if I am just misunderstanding the rules of the game.  If I'm "playing it wrong" then I'd love to know why and how.  As it stands, the game seems really overly simple and not well designed, unfortunately.  I think that I get what the author was aiming for - a simple mechanic that doesn't spend a lot of time with the fiddly bits of conflict resolution.  A design concept that tries to get the rolls out of the way and then jump into narrating the results of those rolls.  The problem I found, though, was that the resolution mechanic was just too simple.  Too black-and-white.  The game specifically states that if an obstacle comes up that, if the players couldn't overcome it, would stop the story, just give them what they want.  A pretty simple rule of thumb obviously inspired by Dogs in the Vineyard.  Great, except that if you do that, conflict becomes useless because you're only in conflict over things that won't interrupt the story.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI found that the roll being applied in reverse order (initiate the conflict, roll to determine the results, narrate the conflict while steering it to those results) didn't work.  As soon as the dice hit the table and success or failure was determined, people lost interest and wanted to move on.  There was no tension.  It got to a point where I was dreading conflict because it was so counter-intuitive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt, for me, like Cold City was trying to be a simplified Dogs.  To boil all the sees and raises and conflict-as-character-advancement into a single roll.  It really didn't work for me.  The one thing I really did like was the Trust mechanic and we didn't even get to use that.  The Hidden Agendas were neat, but never came into play.  I think a solution for this would have been to assign the national agendas myself.  Have the GM give them, as orders, to the individual PCs.  That way they'd be tied to the game.  Maybe I, or my players, weren't pushing hard enough for this but it just didn't come out right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the setting is marvelous but the mechanics just don't back it up.  Next time I play this I think I'm going to just use the mechanics from Dogs in the Vineyard and find a way to attach the Hidden Agenda and trust mechanics to it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224688/#Comment_224688" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T09:33:28+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  9:33AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played The Mountain Witch? My sense of Cold City is that the mechanics are very strongly inspired by the Mountain Witch (trust, d6s with degrees of success, hidden agendas, the whole bit) but that, in practice Cold City is significantly harder to run than the Witch because it doesn't have the tight scenario (group of ronin climb mountain to kill the witch) to provide it with structure.<br/><br/>I have also had mixed experiences with Cold City in the past, even though I love Malcolm's inspiring settings. Some of that, in my case, had to do with playing with only a few players (like 3), which doesn't give the trust mechanics room to shine, but there were some other resolution issues too. However, I think it's critical, in games like Cold City and Mouse Guard, to <i>narrate the actual in-game events that the mechanical results describe.</i> Otherwise, the story content of the game has no teeth and you're just moving these numbers around.  I know you said your players weren't interested in the fiction after the roll, but heading down that path is guaranteed to suck, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224692/#Comment_224692" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T09:54:48+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  9:54AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played the Mountain Witch but, yeah, it seemed pretty similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy group was the same, pretty small.  Three players.  Two of which ended up giving each other most of the trust and one outsider who was sort of forced, as a result, to sit much of the game out.  Despite my attempts to help him get involved.  We've been playing Mouse Guard for a while and have had no problem at all with narrating the results of the conflict.  In Mouse Guard you end up with a play structure that encourages conflict.

The PCs are on the roof of an abandoned apartment building in the middle of the night, cold rain is pouring down on them while they try and talk the infected scientist who inadvertently injected himself with some extraplanar mind-control spores down from the edge.

Not if the dice had anything to say about it.  I decided this was an Influence conflict.  We shored up the dice pools, established the stakes, rolled once and it was over.  Bam.  The whole conflict.  Herr Doctor rolled a 4,5,3,3,6 and the PCs rolled 6,7,3,10,10,10 and that was it.  The whole conflict had been resolved without any actual tension.  So then it fell to me to say to the PCs "okay, you get him to come with you, NOW let's play out the scene where you do that." except that since all the tension had been taken out of it, nobody (myself included) really felt the need to do that.

Combat is a little different, right, because you can roll and not necessarily kill everything on the first roll, but otherwise, yeah.  I mean, if you want drawn out conflicts, you could treat situations like monsters, yeah? Require multiple independent rolls to succeed at overcoming them.

I mean, I buy games to play them, not to fail at playing them and have to change the system so that they work.  I feel pretty bad about the whole affair (and, admittedly, i'm being overly sensitive) but I am going to be a little more wary about what games I bring to the table in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224704/#Comment_224704" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T10:44:43+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 10:44AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2009 10:59AM by Adrian P.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One area where I don't think Cold City gives a lot of guidance (and Don't Rest Your Head is the same) is how to pace conflicts. I think the trick to Cold City conflicts is to establish beforehand how climactic you want the conflict to be and set the stakes accordingly - so in order to convince the scientist, perhaps the conflict needs to be broken down into smaller-stake, mini-conflicts. Perhaps they have to first catch up with him (conflict), then stop him diving off the building (conflict), and finally convince him to trust them enough to spill his guts (conflict).<br/><br/>Re-reading that, that's not the most elegant of examples I've given (what happens if they fail the first one? Personally, I'd be inclined to have that mean that the Consequences from that conflict make stopping him from jumping harder, representing a big lead he has rather than that he gets clean away. What about the second? Again, the Consequences can influence the outcome, and jumping need not = death: 1 or 2 points and he's not in Crisis, just injured, even 3+ points he might be dying or incapacitated rather than dead), but hopefully you get the idea.<br/><br/>Trollbabe could suffer from the same issue, but solves it by giving every conflict a Pace - resolving the overall conflict is the result of 1, 3 or 5 rolls, depending on the degree of focus. A finale conflict might require winning 3 out of 5 rolls for instance, while a less significant one only 1 out of 1, or 2 out of 3. I've toyed with porting this over into Cold City and Hot War (and Don't Rest Your Head), so maybe this could help?<br/><br/>Regarding Hidden Agendas, it's my understanding that the GM generally assigns (perhaps with player negotiation) National agendas and players assign Personal ones - that way the GM can interweave agendas more easily. Agendas should be rearing their heads frequently in the game - they act as pretty strong flags, so the background plot should be riddled with opportunities for these to intersect, otherwise, as it sounds like occurred in your game, they can easily be overlooked.<br/><br/>Edit: had another thought: I think Cold City conflicts are better without the often binary stake setting you see in some games: "You win, the scientist comes with you and spills his secrets. he wins, he jumps to his death". Rather, these form the intent of both parties ("I try to convince him to come with us"), but what actually happens is informed by the level of success and the Consequences chosen by the winner, so you don't actually know he's dead if he wins, it's still open - if he wins with 1 Consequence, I generally see that as a partial success - jumped, but then had second thoughts and is hanging by one arm on the ledge 6ft below, for example. <br/><br/>A 3 point 'Attribute reduced to 0' Consequence is usually pretty final in a suicide attempt, however. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224707/#Comment_224707" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T10:53:48+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 10:53AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consequences seemed like a weird issue, too.

I guess I wanted to keep the conflicts to a minimum because of all the "give the players what they want" advice inherent in the game.  In this case, we simply narrated finding the Doctor's hidden lab, chasing him to the roof and some initial talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's no support in the mechanics for "you get what you want but there are consequences" because, honestly, the winner both gets what he wants and gets to dish out the consequences.  Unlike, say, Mouse Guard, there's no way that a conflict can end with both sides getting any part of what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't read that any part of character generation is supposed to be GM-oriented.

That sounds like an awful lucky roll. You were only looking at how many dice beat the highest opposing one right? E.g 1 2 9 vs 3 8 9 10 is 1 success, not 4?<br/><br/>The 'get what you want, but there are consequences' only comes with 3+ participants, where the highest winner narrates and assigns the most Consequences, but other winners have Consequences to dish out too. I guess you might also be able to choose to assign negative Consequences to your own character on a win, just because it fits the situation? <br/><br/>However, I think Jonathan Walsh has hit upon something: in my understanding combat is just like any other conflict - so just as the enemies not dead until they hit Crisis, the seduced Soviet agent needn't fall straight into your character's bed unless she has similarly hit Crisis. So multiple conflicts each resolving some specific, but not necessarily all-encompassing goal, could be the way to go if you want the possibility of both sides chalking up bad Consequences.<br/><br/>Personally, after a few initial misgivings (mainly about the use of Trust and the big dice pools in multiple-player conflicts acting together), I really like the Cold City/Hot War system. However, it does seem a little more clear in Hot War, mainly through its extended example conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224715/#Comment_224715" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T11:21:53+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 11:21AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2009 11:22AM by skinnyghost.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a team effort on an Influence roll.  The main character had 4 influence and added 2 traits and both other characters added 3 influence and another 3 traits.  The pool was huge and against a competing pool of 5 with results no better than 4 on any given die.  It was a bit of a rare thing but still kind of a huge problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we were coming at it from too much of a Mouse Guard kind of angle, but it seems to me that if your goal in a conflict is "Kill my enemy" and you win, your enemy ought to be dead - crisis point or no.  I mean, that's how conflict is supposed to play out, right?  If you win the conflict you get to narrate it with your goal being the one that is achieved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing just felt so quick and without any kind of back-and-forth to any given roll.  It's the first time I'd ever felt like we'd have been better off just discarding the rules and we ended up just free-forming the last third of the game because we couldn't stand the mechanics anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm trying to figure out now is where the problem lies.

For example we were investigating a murder scene and my character heard a sound from the closet while alone, the GM just laid on the description of my character reaching for the door, kept cutting to the other characters search and back to me, then we made the roll. Very tense and fun.<br/><br/>But most of the tension in the game comes from trying to work on your agendas, especially when all of the characters have conflicting agendas. In our game I was an American who wanted to make sure the Soviet did not get any intel on the twisted tech, the Soviet of course was under orders to steal the tech plus had a personal agenda to try and defect to the US, and then the German player just wanted to destroy all evidence of the tech so Germany could move on. So in play I had to place my trust in the German, as I could not trust some evil communist now could I? Mean while the Russian desperately wanted to gain my trust so he could defect, which was clearly a ploy to steal the tech or so I thought...<br/><br/>Yes the conflict resolution is a little too the point, but it is kinda meant to be as I think as the real meat of the game is in trying to figure out who to trust on the team and trying to figure out what their agenda is and if it means they will betray you. Remember trusting the other characters make the team more affective, but those dice are even more powerful when they betray that trust to fulfill their agenda.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224730/#Comment_224730" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T12:08:23+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 12:08PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jason.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving read that and some of the AP on the publisher's website I feel like maybe the mechanic and the setting just need to be separated.

You get them all the time. We ran a campaign, and I believe out of all the rolls made, no matter at what level of pool we were using, only two rolls out of an entire campaign did NOT come up as Partial Successes. "Partial Success!" even became our group's comical war-cry that was synonymous with "I'm frustrated!" (for in-game or out-of-game events). I really think that was the one that broke the mechanical flow of the game for us more than anything else; I feel that most other concerns could have been addressed best through more examples and play guidance, though.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224751/#Comment_224751" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T14:12:58+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  2:12PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy - as a GM I'm pretty emotionally invested in the enjoyment of my players.

Not all conflict resolutions play the same or require the same things of players.  Like I said, Cold City's standard conflict resolution isn't a step-by-step mechanical thing.  It's one-roll and you're done.  If you treat it like a step-by-step thing and go in expecting the mechanics to pace the conflict for you, OF COURSE you're going to come away disappointed, because the mechanics don't pace the conflict much at all.  But not all games or players necessarily expect or want the mechanics to pace the conflict.  I know I was horribly disappointed with In A Wicked Age, for example, because I came in expecting the mechanics to pace the conflicts like they do in Dogs.  But IAWA works way differently, so it failed at the table for me the first time (and second).<br/><br/>I think if games like that have failings, it's in not making it explicitly clear to the players what is required of them and how to approach resolution.  That's a very hard thing to do as a game writer, because everyone comes in with their own expectations, but it's critical to get your game to work for a variety of different audiences. So I wouldn't necessarily say the mechanics failed you or that the game doesn't gel with your playing style.  It certainly didn't gel with what you wanted and expected from the game the first time you played it, but it's not like people can only play games one way.  It's really up to you to decide whether you're willing to make the effort to figure out how to change your expectations to fit what the mechanics DO do, or, alternately, change the mechanics to better support the kind of play that you are already comfortable with. If you're not willing or find it easier to just abandon the mechanics for something else that you like, that's totally cool too, but it's not the only solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224786/#Comment_224786" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T18:06:22+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  6:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick Question: Are you familiar with other "one roll" resolution systems, like Primetime Adventures?<br/><br/>The key to making those kinds of systems work right is that whatever is riding on the one single die roll has to be palpably tense BEFORE you deploy the system.  You can't start a conflict thinking, "Man the tension's really going to build over this one!"  Because it won't.  It has to already be built.<br/><br/>Part of that involves naming the exact right goal for the conflict.  I was playing a Primetime Adventures game.  It was the last episode of the season.  The show was about a family of 18th Century clockwork engineers and their rivalry with a family who worked with electricity.  It was nearing the end of the episode and the two families were meeting to have a technological duel.  The clockwork family brought this battlemech like thing.  The electricity family just brought this odd black box.<br/><br/>I turn to one the players and I say, "So this about winning the duel right?"  And he says, "No, this about ruining their reputation."  That was fucking perfect!  It didn't matter who won the duel all that mattered was that the result destroyed one of the families socially.  Those were the perfect stakes.  The group was clearly already buzzing with excitement.  I blew my budget.  The player blew his fan mail...<br/><br/>And...<br/><br/>And...<br/><br/>Well, I'm not going to tell you to emphasize my point.  The fact that there was no, back and forth over the duel or whatever didn't matter because socially and creatively we were all wired over just how devastatingly important this one draw of the cards was going to be.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224824/#Comment_224824" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T05:30:25+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  5:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I think Jesse has it nailed for me.<br/><br/>In Cold City when you have a conflict of interest you build up in free play to a point where you want to see how it falls -- then you go to the roll, building in your traits and assembling your pool. The roll then determines the outcome, the traits used how it is happening, and the level of consequence how well or badly it goes. It looks like your expectation was that the roll would start off a back and forth, and that really rocks for your group.<br/><br/>Cold City just doesn't do that mechanically. It could give someone consequences that they roll over into another arena or a follow-up roll, and consequential scenes and conflicts might spiral off of the first. But that's not the same thing. And what to get for your 9 successes? A couple of Traits and a bunch of dice for my next Influence roll please.<br/><br/>Mechanics-wise I have issues with the marginal successes and with the general trait whoring where people say "fuck the fiction" and bring in every trait and agenda that they can, which actually drowns out the effects of trust (and the larger pools create an expectation of more success but only create more marginal successes). And Trust is the hook of the game, so anything that smears its effect out is bad in my book. I also don't like the adding dice for using negative traits, but a whole bunch of folk liked it and it does make people bring them in (I'd get the opponent in a conflict to bring them in). But I'm fine with its one roll to determine an outcome, that's a valid way of playing.<br/><br/>I would say that you missed a HUGE part of the Cold City feel and experience by the following; "The one thing I really did like was the Trust mechanic and we didn't even get to use that. The Hidden Agendas were neat, but never came into play."<br/><br/>My advice would be as GM, bring their Hidden Agendas into play. Put stuff in the fiction that goes against one player's Hidden Agenda but would advance another's. National Agendas from the GM should pop the play with things that will put PCs into Conflict, make and break alliances and make the PCs question who they can trust (their National bosses? any of their fellow RPA agents?). Ideally National and Personal Agendas will be at odds too, not necessarily directly opposed but not a clear win-win unified path. No one is a truly "company" man in Cold City for it to have that post-War Third Man feel.<br/><br/>If you've got a group working seamlessly together wanting a conflict being played out in beats. Then... uh... play Mouse Guard. Seriously. It scratches that itch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225397/#Comment_225397" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T10:07:19+00:00" title="August 18, 2009 10:07AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally, I enjoy the potential that the game has but I feel like my group and I just never reached that potential.  I haven't written it off completely (and, having cooled down a little after our initial failure with the system, I feel a bit better about giving it a second go) but I feel like I'd have to take some of the lessons I learned from playing and from talking about it here and apply them.  Which bothers me a little because I am not used to having to "fail" at games before I understand them.  The book, I think, should prepare me for that.<br/><br/>Maybe that's my only real criticism - I wasn't quite "ready" for how the game was going to play out.  I think that Hidden Agendas didn't come into play because we played a Closed Game and everyone came up with their agendas separate from each other and from my story as prepared.  Admittedly, I tweaked the story a little for their sake and tried to push their agendas a little during character creation but the whole thing wasn't handled quite right.<br/><br/>At any rate, I am happy to have bought the game and it got me thinking about a lot of things I otherwise wouldn't.  Even if maybe the mechanics didn't work out for this group it might work for another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225460/#Comment_225460" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T12:14:24+00:00" title="August 18, 2009 12:14PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool! Here's hoping for better luck next time. :-)<br/><br/>Actually, if playing a closed game where the Agendas are hidden from the players then the GM really must go to town and pit them against each other. In an open game the players can do that for themselves (Oh, you have that agenda? Sweet! That's at odds with mine. Let's get it on!).<br/><br/>But in a closed game, since only the GM and that player of the agenda know what it is, then the GM has to be the one setting out fictional things that will be interesting to the varying National and Personal agendas of the PCs. And the GM has to make those fictional things cause the agendas to be at least partially if not fully opposed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225486/#Comment_225486" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T14:21:00+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  2:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2009 2:21PM by Steerpike.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did the players write their own Personal and National Agendas? <br/><br/>We played a closed game in which we wrote our own Personal Agenda, but the GM wrote the National ones and they were very integrated to the mission at hand and in conflict with the other player's Agendas.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225503/#Comment_225503" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T14:56:05+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  2:56PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The players wrote their own Personal and National Agendas.

That sounds lame. <br/><br/>When you played Mouse Guard did the players have the same issue with playing their Beliefs and Goals? I know that Cold City as a game does not focus mechanically on the Agendas as much as Mouse Guard does on Beliefs and Goals, but they are just as important. Pursuing your Agenda in Cold City is just as important to this game as searching for sinners is in Dogs. <br/><br/>My suggestion if you go back to this game would be to really get the players on board with following their Agendas to the fullest and if they are not cool with it, then perhaps another game? Also if you do play again either have all the players write their own Agendas and do an open game or you as the GM should write their secret National Agendas in a closed game.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225539/#Comment_225539" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T16:37:26+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  4:37PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing Mouse Guard was practically seamless as far as this stuff goes.  The players latched on to their Beliefs and Goals as the conflict-generating-engines that the rules present them to be.  They created all kinds of opportunity.  With Cold City, it was less-so.  I'm starting to feel like the closed-ness of the game was what wrecked it.  If we'd all had a chance to create Agendas out in the open, maybe it'd have given everyone a little more impetus to tie everything together.<br/><br/>I'm getting all kinds of interesting feedback from this thread.  We're going to be trying 3:16 and maybe Houses of the Blooded over the next few months.<br/><br/>John and Gregor better look out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
