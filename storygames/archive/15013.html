But there are a lot of setting questions that haven't been answered, and I'm looking for tools to help hone it in.<br/><br/>The game we'll be using is Smallville. The character creation process seems great at answering many important story questions. What are the important NPCs? What are the important locations? And that will go a long way to building out setting. But it doesn't have any answer for "what are the rules of the setting?"<br/><br/>We've already talked about no FTL travel. It's going to be pretty hard sci-fi in that respect.  The system will either be Gliese 581 or based on that idea. There is hibernation technology to make the trip possible with the same crew that left. The "shock", if you will, is that either the sun and/or abandoned alien technology has caused some (or one) persons to gain superpowers.  We are aiming for a Firefly feel, a mix of western and sci-fi, with superpowers.<br/><br/>But, there are still some big questions for the setting. Is the colony young or old? Is Earth still around or a distant memory? Are we stuck planetside (for now) or do we have travel between planets (and space stations)?  What's the general technology level, and how much do we want that to impact stories (e.g. are we more space opera, where future-tech is just present day analogs, or does technology turn a mirror on our assumptions of humanity)?<br/><br/>Now, I COULD break these into a questionnaire and just go with that.  What I'm looking for is any games that present something either more structured, or more "gamey".  Even if it doesn't fit into the questions above, that's fine. That's just an example of the area where I want help in finding answers, big setting questions.<br/><br/>The first thing that jumped to mind is Shock. However, I think it's goal and presentation is a bit too focused, but if I'm wrong, let me know.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not too interested in randomized results. I've considered a Fiasco playset, Diaspora system generation, and In A Wicked Age Oracles, and concluded that, since this will be an extended campaign, I don't think those styles of random would be optimal. But it's not out of the question (I may make a Oracle or Playset and propose it as an option to the group)<br/><br/>In the other thread, Ryan Macklin mentioned Microscope which sounds like it could be what I want, although as a game unto-itself it might be too involved for this purpose - Smallville character creation is already an involved process. So, I'm definitely looking for pieces of games, so I can go buy them and consume them for precious resources.  <br/><br/>Other types of things that I think could work: Blossoms Are Falling style questions. A modified Burning Empires world burner. Dresden Files city creation (tweaked to be "the universe as we know it").  Bonus points if you can suggest a way in which it could feed into Smallville character creation (like adding locations and/or Extras)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341284/#Comment_341284" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T16:41:40+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  4:41PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool.  <br/><br/>If I may throw out a suggestion, skip the super powers from the sun thing and go with everyone (secretly) having strange dreams while they were in hibernation.  Base the powers off their dreams perhaps with a psychic spin.  Let them wonder if the powers (when discovered) are a side effect of the hibernation drugs and time or were they tampered with while in transit.  Have them wonder if they are now lab rats.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341290/#Comment_341290" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T16:57:38+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  4:57PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a cool idea, but I'm looking for tools to come to a group consensus on the setting, especially the non-secret stuff.<br/><br/>Some, if not all, of the players want the setting to have secrets and mystery, so I LOVE the idea. But that's sort of a stage 2 when I put together my secret plots based on there character generation.  Smallville is extremely character driven.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341300/#Comment_341300" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T17:27:41+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  5:27PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 12:14AM by Todd_L.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080617213627/http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html=Lexicon.HomePage" rel="nofollow">Lexicon</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341312/#Comment_341312" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T18:51:23+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  6:51PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin -- that's a fucking cool set-up.  Wish I was geographically closer to you to play!<br/><br/>Smallville great choice for this.  I get what you're saying about wanting to steal subsystems from other games for a more rulesy approach to world building.  Of course Mortal Coil has their core document and building out from there with inventing facts by spending points.  Maybe that's something to lift there.  Since you're playing Smallville, I can see that as the GM you could spend some of the trouble pool to invent exceptions (complications) to whatever the players invent.  So you say "yes, but..." and then  maybe a D4 is a minor exception all the way up to a D10 which is pretty freaking major.  "Yes, Player One, there is a vast desert ruled by isolated nomads but..." you push forward a d4 "they have been known to perpetuate some criminal activity within the neighboring towns" ranging to a D10 "but...they are gearing themselves up for a religious war against the colonists." (D12 might be the D10 complication plus "and they plan to attack within days...")<br/><br/>So in other words, it's you reacting to world building the players are doing but you have complications they roll, the trouble pool you're accruing and their powers (which sometimes provide trouble dice) as exceptions-based determinations handed down by you.<br/><br/>As for how the players can generate setting....let them do in only two circumstances: one, when they test.  Best exposition comes about from things you learn in conflict of some kind anyway. Think Inception here where exposition handed out generously but usually in the midst of Shit Going Down.  And two, the episode's Tag Scenes.  Let it serve as moment of 'color' scene building to fluff out setting (and next game, you can always use the Trouble pool and the PCs rolled complications to provide exceptions to whatever they came up with in their tag scene from previous game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
