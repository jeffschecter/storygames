NOT waiting to meetup, NOT blathering or gossiping or sorting out food for a half hour until settling down. I mean actual play periods (including reasonable, necessary breaks of course).<br/><br/>I ask because I'm finding that, as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I age</span> my gaming group ages, a "session" is becoming, like, MAYBE three hours. I barely get my groove on in that time, unless I do some warm up on my own in advance. Cons typically have a four-hour session standard, but at least 15 minutes of that is waiting or wrapping up--I've always felt rushed, and like the game was ended... not FINISHED.<br/><br/>Back In The Day, a six-hour session was nominal for us, with some all-nighter eight-hour or ten-hour sessions on weekends. We'd never have considered treying to do a James Bond module in four hours, or a D&amp;D crawl in three. (It took Champions to bring us to the "Holy fuck, ONE combat took us the WHOLE evening?!?")<br/><br/>Feel free to give the whys and wherefores for your particular session length, too--I'm more interesting in mitigating factors than a mere poll. What can I do to make these old farts get and stay focused for longer than a Lord of the Rings movie?!?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236176/#Comment_236176" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T13:38:17+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  1:38PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, for my group real life trumps real game play time.<br/>\n<br/>\nA semi official 8:30 start time and a semi official 11:00 end time means that after all the preliminaries are out of the way we're talking 1 1/2 to 2 hours of real actual play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an issue for me (but as the person at the table with no second job and no kids I'm not really in a position to complain about it).

There's pretty much only trade-offs rather than pure improvement available in tweaking your complexity, though.

Basically, we play until we're creatively exhausted, then we stop.</blockquote>\nThis is interesting to me, because that's actually how I prefer to play... but my current crowd of players either can't (prior commitments) or won't (love the long session for its own sake) hear of it. It's been years since a regularly recurring short game session was really the norm for me.<br><br>What makes this interesting to me, though, is that I <b>offload</b> the creative energy burden by playing prep-heavier, more traditional "GM proposes, players dispose" games in this environment. I can distribute the creative energy I need across multiple shorter bursts across several weeks, and come to that long session ready to put on a show for 4 hours. Meanwhile, players tend to check in and check out over the course of the session (and the creative expectations on them aren't as high), so we manage these long sessions energy-wise fairly well.<br><br>I'd rather play the short, prep-low, everybody-engaged, creative-at-the-table style. But under the strictures of the format I have, we adapt. I wonder if this correlates in any way to the actual development and popularity of the "trad game" model?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236190/#Comment_236190" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T14:01:48+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  2:01PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Monday night group <i>plays</i> for about two to two and a half hours, and spends only about fifteen to twenty minutes in chit-chat around that.

Often actual play time was shorter.<br/><br/>Second, campaign style play was not happening in any reasonable sense. Whatever I was playing really needed to have some kind of wrap up within 1-3 sessions, with 1-2 being a better bet, and one-session optimal.<br/><br/>Third, the game almost always needed to be playable with around 3-4 players. One-shots could be bigger.<br/><br/>Those limitations have decisively changed my interests in games, my own personal design thinking, game night organizing, and buying patterns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236221/#Comment_236221" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T15:27:28+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  3:27PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play for about six hours.

If you only have three hours, DON'T play a game where combats take two. Try something a bit more indie where you can play an adventure in two or three hours instead, it'll be more satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236224/#Comment_236224" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T15:34:43+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  3:34PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2009 4:36PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say our time spent actually playing the game is at least 2 hours and never more than 4.  2.5 to 3 hours is a good session length.  There's about a half-hour to an hours' worth of socializing on either side of there, too.<br/><br/>And like others have said, I think this is <i>perfect.</i>  I wouldn't want to play longer than that.  I don't want to do the old high school thing where we'd start playing on Saturday afternoon and come stumbling home on Monday morning.  I have other things I need to do and other things I want to do, and I can have just as much fun (and maybe even more) in a 3-hour session as I ever had in one of those lost weekends. <br/><br/><br/>I tend to agree that good prep makes long sessions better...but I'd also add that good prep makes short sessions better, too.  There's really no substitute for preparation; even your off-the-cuff improvisation is better if you've taken time before the game begins to prepare <i>something</i>.  It gets your head in the right space (what David Artman was referring to as doing some "warm up on my own in advance", I think), and if you come up with something usable <i>before</i> you play it'll be that much more awesome when you actually use it (because you'll be able to edit, pare down, polish, and generally improve your idea).<br/><br/>But then, I'm kind of a low-prep apostate.  I try to prep even for low-prep games, because I like the results so much better. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236234/#Comment_236234" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T16:06:05+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  4:06PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Four hours, it's the time my two gaming groups have to play.

After three hours of highly creative, active play - such as iawa or DRYH - we simply need to gather energy again.<br/>This also means that I prefer games that either are "all played out" after three hours or divides nicely into three hour bits.<br/>/Peter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236277/#Comment_236277" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T01:31:04+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  1:31AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We play until we're done, which usually takes 2-3 hours.

I'm singing by, oh, midnight on the first evening (assume, say, an eight-o-clock Game On) and can go to 2 or 3 am, only to get up and back into character by 9 or 10 (damned SUNLIGHT!).<br/><br/>I have a similar pace in table top, though I probably don't embody character as much at the table and so I don't have as long a warm-up cycle. Probably the ONLY think that makes me muzzy headed during TT play is when it's on a work night, we don't start until 7 or 8, we're drinking and smoking ourselves a bit silly, and folks just get generally drowsy and ready for bed. but to meet up at, say, noon... and be done by FOUR?!?

Jeepformers would just laugh at such a notion, I'm sure (yes, I'm aware that JF games aren't on-going or long-form). My own experiences are, apparently, far-and-away better than those characterized above: serious, immersed players, very little "wandering," lots of back-and-forth playing off things that don't even necessarily provide efficacy or advance "plot." (One of my favorites was regaling a group about how sublime pizza tastes, after my Toreadore gained the Eat Food Merit.)<br/><br/>Any good LARPer has a foundation in improv. Improv's Rule 0 is cooperation.<br/><br/>I'm sorry your experiences have been so trivial and lacking in creative verve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236952/#Comment_236952" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T18:48:41+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  6:48PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two hours.

The dude relaxes and has fun playing for days at a time, that doesn't sound trivial to me, it sounds pretty great. I know my very-long-LARP (also Vampire) experiences were the same. It's a getaway, an escape, you enjoy yourself enormously. Not everything needs to be a deep and considered explication of the human spirit. Sometimes you just want to sneer at Space Nazis and pick up girls. Hell, these days, after a week of my current job, the very very very very very last thing I want in my pretendy funtime, LARP or tabletop, is to delve deeply and thoroughly into the serious side of the human psyche. Shit, I just washed all that off before the game, can't I throw a fireball at an orc now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237193/#Comment_237193" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T11:52:37+00:00" title="October 13, 2009 11:52AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that thing JD said.<br/><br/>In my own personal experience, full-on days-at-a-time immersion into a makebelieve world was just orders of magnitude less intense than 4 hours of emotionally kicking each other in the nuts.
