Unfortunately he planned for the wrong apocalypse and the world went to hell in a hand basket because of rogue AI, and humanity evacuated Earth and bombed it/cordoned it off. Now, 20 years later some of those "backups" have been restarted into cheap cyborg/machine bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things that might be interesting <br/>\n - human survivors stumbling into the bunker. How have they survivied?<br/>\n - some way off earth to join the evacuees?<br/>\n - adjusting to "new tech, new bodies" when your last memory was of some brain scan experiment.<br/>\n - Who else is in the vault of "backups"?<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically want to get some more brainstorming ideas, and some nice ways of planting the above hooks.<br/>\nAny help is greatly appreciated, as i've not run (or played) a sci-fi game for many many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nK                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349070/#Comment_349070" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T15:05:30+00:00" title="November 16, 2011  3:05PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also any hints on running Fate would be useful (not run any gae with fate points/aspects before)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349071/#Comment_349071" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T15:09:55+00:00" title="November 16, 2011  3:09PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, Eclipse Phase. 1000 build points still frightens me a bit, even though the setting is gorgeous.<br/><br/>I haven't ever played or run it, but have read all the books. I once heard an AP podcast of a first session though, and I thought it was a brilliant way to open a campaign. The first session was a prequel session, set during the Fall. It makes a great way for you to introduce some of the future tech at a more even pace and let them feel the Fall for themselves since it's such an important game idea. It works well if they haven't read fully through the books themselves, but it might still be a cool way to start it even for the knowledgeable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349074/#Comment_349074" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T15:19:34+00:00" title="November 16, 2011  3:19PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            heh.. yeah, we took one look at the rules and said "no".<br/>\nFate looks much simpler :) Although none of us have actually  played it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349077/#Comment_349077" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T15:37:01+00:00" title="November 16, 2011  3:37PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the system is a mess.

After aspects are created, plot becomes easy.<br/><br/>I know Diaspora is made for this sort of thing, but my favorite FATE to date is Dresden. You could probably hack city creation to create the world you're living on, create some good NPCs for conflict, bring out some more highlights and themes of the world that you haven't explored yet (all you have is the AI, you need complication!), and you do it as a group. Then, plot hooks become cake.

PC will never have everything they want, but always need to make hard choices to get things (possible aspect - what is this going to cost me?)<br/><br/>rogue AI - current activities I have no idea really. Only that there are a bunch of them which have decimated Earth and caused humanity to try to evacuate as many as they could, and that Earth is now quarantined from the rest of the solar system (blockade of killer satellites etc)<br/><br/>I'll take a re-read of the city creation rules from dresden. <br/><br/>good point about "plot". From last games we found the best fun from when there was no predefined story happening, just a bunch of people and places to investigate and the PCs made their own stories. We are walking into the game with some bits of the setting set in stone (general tech is around Ghost in the shell/Blade runner level etc) but a lot of things left open for the players to add to.<br/><br/>eg - a player is a worker in a big interplanetary company, what that company does exactly is not defined - during the game we decide "this is a weapons manufacturer". After that point no-one (players or GM) can say that its a mining company anymore, but someone could say "they dont make handguns, they make tanks". We find playing with a fairly skeletal background is more enjoyable than having everything fleshed out before we even start playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349169/#Comment_349169" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-18T09:47:04+00:00" title="November 18, 2011  9:47AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try playing with anti-climatic scenes.

That said, this is what I would do:<br/><br/>Follow the instructions above but:<br/><br/>- Given them an extra Aspect so that they have 2 connections to other PCs. Try to spread out these connections as evenly as possible. If your game has player vs. play conflict, use these Aspects to build tension. If your game is about teamwork, use these Aspects to build reasons the PCs care about each other, stand by each other, and fight together. <br/><br/>- Come up with a list of keywords for hooks. You already have some, things like "scarcity", "rogue AI", "AIs hunting humans", "human evacuation", and "quarantines".<br/><br/>- Ask each player to pick two of these keywords and explain how they are causing them major problems. Since you said the setting is very deadly, maybe ask how these things are threatening their lives. Not only that, how are they threatening their lives right now. Why is this an immediate threat? Why is time running out to solve this problem? If they fail, who or what else will go down with them (preferably someone or something they care about)? Write an Aspect about it. Have PCs Aspects overlap somehow. They might have different problems but the solutions somehow overlap. <br/><br/>Here is the tricky part. What people say they want changes. Often you don't really know what you want till you start playing. So don't plan too much, test these Aspects out, see if they still care about them by the end of the session. If they do, then you can start to get hardcore with session 2. Creating NPCs with opposing Aspects, creating NPCs that complicate the PCs Aspects, and much more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349247/#Comment_349247" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T02:05:49+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  2:05AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, using aspects to tie together characters <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm going to have char-creation on tuesday, so I'll see how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349250/#Comment_349250" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T06:19:12+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  6:19AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, yea, Jenskot's got the good of it.

That was a very interesting game!<br/><br/>None of us had ever played fate, so we eased into it. We talked a little about what we didn't like in the last game we had (exalted) - the characters got too powerful and nothing was a real challenge, they were not invested in the things around them only what they wanted, and the rules bogged down the roleplaying.<br/><br/>After about 10 mins of chatting we came up with a few "core wants":<br/> - Real risks and challenges for the characters.<br/> - Character investment in the world<br/> - Personal scale abilities - no one is able to affect the world in a real way.<br/> - Unknowable/unmovable threats (cthulu in the background type thing).<br/><br/>Then we talked a little about making world more sci fi etc. Everyone was familiar with Ghost in the Shell, Cyberpunk 2020, Blade Runner. We determined that the "pre-fall" tech was something about that level, and that there was the addition of "brain backups". Everyone was going to start as a person restored from a backup.<br/><br/>Then we started going around - each player would make aspects. 1 each going around in turn. <br/>Core of Character<br/>How they got involved/noticed by the others<br/>Their motivation - how they act/continue if everything is lost.<br/><br/>We dont have names for everyone, but it was enough to go on. We'll call 'em S, G, C, A<br/>Basically the player were feeling their way towards a character. They were bouncing around ideas and co-operating to get each aspect. Everyone made their first aspect in turn, then went around making the second, etc. (honestly it was awesome seeing all of them so involved and enthusiastic about each others characters and trying to tie them all together from the get go.)<br/><br/>S has the following aspects<br/>"genius inventor"<br/>"Don't question it, I'm right!"<br/>"Humanity must evolve or die"<br/><br/>He was describing his character as something like Tony Stark, arrogant in his own brilliance but driven to use science and technology to improve humanity. Also there were some intimations of Daniel Graystone from Caprica<br/><br/>G had<br/>"I know a guy..."<br/>"You get what you pay for"<br/>"The end justifies the means"<br/><br/>This guy we ended up as seeing like Tony Soprano. A not quite legitimate business person who believe that influence is the only power/currency worth anything He was definitely working with S <br/><br/>C - <br/>"Rogue Journalist"<br/>"They are out to get us!"<br/>"The truth is out there"<br/><br/>Big inspirations were Rorschach and Question. He's considered a bit of a conspiracy nutter and paranoid. He was investigating S on suspicions of criminal connections. No one can make that much money without making a few bad decisions.<br/><br/>A<br/>"Human first activist"<br/>"I saw it coming!"<br/>"The individual is sacred"<br/><br/>Both A and S players were getting really involved - A is nearly the antithesis of S, but they are both shooting for the same goal - humanity must survive and prosper in the future. But their methods are totally different. A believes that people should always be directly responsible for their actions on the world and each other and technology should stop interfering. She is totally against the idea of brain backups or any kind of mental interference.<br/><br/>Everyone was excited and pumped up at this stage, so we kicked off the game.<br/><br/>They were all awoken in a coffin like enclosure with a glass cover - here we started getting into the fate mechanics - each took a stress test against composure - they had just been "reloaded" into mechanical bodies - how did each of them cope?<br/><br/>S used his "genius inventor" aspect and setup that this was HIS backup facility and he was expecting this. He passed with flying colours.<br/>G used his "you get what you pay for" and described his last memories as being paid with "a chance at immortality" by S for getting some illegal tech. He also passed.<br/>C just let the dice fall and took 2 stress - which he took as a consequence. "Alien abduction experiment" He started to panic and rant about "They finally got me!"<br/>A actually wanted to fail - she asked for a fate point to take "The individual is sacred" as a problem... she took 5 stress and a consequence! Worst possible roll. Her consequence was "I am what I hate!"<br/><br/>I literally just sat back as they talked and began to try and work out what was going on. Neither C nor A had any idea how they got there. They couldn't remember the backup process, and only remembered "The war starting". All of them looked identical - mechanical android bodies - but the voices were different. They established who they were, and that they were in some kind of bunker - S was paying fate points to declare that he had planned to build this place, so "I guess I finaly made it". He established that his backup was the "first proof it works" version, and he thought everything was super hi-tech and was very excited exploring the computer systems. A actually kept herself out of most of the conversations, she was lying motionless in the case, and the other thought at first there were only 3 of them. C was first ranting about aliens and abductions before finally recognizing who S was.<br/><br/>They were interrupted by banging at the door - they got some security feeds working and let in 3 ragged people though the vault door. 2 frenchmen and a teenager. There was a tense standoff as they were going to shoot "the damn machines", which was defused by G - "I know a guy..." turned out that he'd worked with one of the frenchman's brother on a military base - this got the survivors talking about what happened to his brother and who the "machine" actually was - and then some more came out about the fall - when war broke out everywhere and people were dying, cities being nuked etc. "The world went mad". They were now surviving by moving all the time, and doing their best to not attract attention of the machines and strange new environment. They were hoping the vault was airtight and secure... The water damaged computers and cracks in the walls led everyone to doubt that.<br/><br/>During the discussions A finally leapt into life! She started yelling accusations at S - its all his fault, she knew all his tech and experiments would lead to this! (fate points were flying). The response to this - quite moving - speech was "Oh god i remember you. Why did you have to survive" from S. The two of them know that they are very involved with each other and have a long standing disagreement/argument (they started singing the muppet show tunes, and quoting Statler and Waldorf)<br/><br/>Some time was spent trying to get into the damaged computer systems and discover what had happened. S found some old archives of mails sent to himself (things I want to remember always) and brought in secret projects with the military and government funding and snippets of strange source code.<br/><br/>C stopped all the talking and stated simply - "I dont want to spend the rest of my life... existence.. power supply arguing over who did what in a mouldy basement. I want off this godforsaken rock." he then rolled a perfect persuasion roll, and everyone else failed to defend - all took the consequence "Want to get off earth, away from the madness"<br/><br/>There we stopped as we'd been playing for 4 hours and it was 9pm and we were still at the office (we all work together and use a conference room at work with whiteboards and couches for our games)<br/><br/>All in all it worked pretty amazingly, and everyone was quite pumped. S was guessing that it would come out that he and A had been married at some time. We are going to spend the week looking over skills and fleshing out the characters a little.<br/><br/>I am/was a little concerned that S seemed to be the central character this session. But we ended on a cliff hanger, and he only has 1 fate point left, while A has 7 and C has 6. I didn't really have to make any "plot hooks" as the players were jumping on their own aspects and riffing off the setting and scene. I think that in the next session we'll see S either drop a little into the background, or go through a lot of problems, while both C and A will start to come into their own. (or so I hope)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
