We used the idea of "alien-ness" more loosely, by making our characters take positions on different sides of the line: some were "locals" and some were "alien" (for instance, a Filipino girl - someone with the wrong skin colour - doing a job normally carried out by men).<br/><br/>I was Chris Nasser, a former criminal (minor) who cleaned up his act and became an overbearing Committee Chair for the Neighbours' Association. The other two were the young new Filipino girl, working in IT and dealing pot (a former associate of Chris Nasser's, from the time before), and an extremely anti-social conspiracy theorist IT guy who lived in a house with windows covered in tin foil.<br/><br/>Things went pretty smoothly at first, even though we didn't feel we had all that much to go on. Unlike other Fiasco games I've seen, we had no problem distributing narrative authority: I took a page from the Tabletop Fiasco playbook and more-or-less said that each scene would take place between two of the PCs. The third player quite naturally narrated background details, played minor characters, and chose the die if given the option to Resolve.<br/><br/>Here's where it was a bit funny, though:<br/><br/>We joyfully rode our characters into trouble in the first Act, but... this meant that almost all the black dice were given out. (We only noticed when we got to the Tilt that out of twelve dice, we'd given out 5 black and only 1 white.)<br/><br/>This made things very awkward in the second Act. Our characters were getting into trouble, and we were eager to see more of it... but by necessity, almost every one of the remaining scenes was supposed to end positively for them.<br/><br/>(This is the opposite of what happened in my previous Fiasco game, where players took more of "I'm trying to get my guy out of trouble!" approach, and we ended up with all black dice for the last few scenes. That also took the creative tension out of scene-framing, because effectively removing the option to Resolve meant things were far more predictable. Having a little more Fiasco experience under my belt, I think I'd handle the inevitable black dice pretty well - it's like a form of dramatic irony: we all know things are going to end badly. But doing so with white dice... that wasn't so obvious for us.)<br/><br/>It took the wind out of our sails a bit. We had a girl crawling into a doghouse to steal a stash of drugs, while the owner's wife climbed out of bed to investigate... but it was supposed to end positively for her. Then there were gunshots (which, again was supposed to go well for her - I narrated the wife getting injured anyway) and the police showed up... which, again, was supposed to go well for me (they were my drugs and it was my house). <br/><br/>This was tough, creatively, and the second Act really flagged. All the tension was going out of the story.<br/><br/>In addition, the third player decided to narrate a couple of Colour scenes for himself, which fit the story well, but, again, due to the lack of choice of die colour, meant that he was effectively both Establishing and Resolving. That didn't help, either. In retrospect, I wondered if I should have stepped in there somehow, but the player was on a roll and it all fit logically - it was his turn to Establish, his character was off by himself and in no danger, his narrated scene was quite complete, from a story perspective, and there were only white dice left, so those of us in charge of Resolving didn't have much to add. (And it wouldn't have felt right to give the white die by suddenly add conflict or complications to those scenes.) The player effectively just grabbed the dice himself and we moved on - the other two characters were shooting shotguns at each other and stealing drugs from snarling dogs, so that took our attention.<br/><br/>Things wrapped up a bit too quickly (as Jason warned me could happen with three players), and the fiasco was over. Thankfully, the last scene ended poorly for Mr. Nasser, as the other players decided the "wild die" could be counted as black - a relief after four scenes in a row which all ended well.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the Aftermath gave us an opportunity to tie up loose ends and bring the story to a conclusion.<br/><br/>Still, though, things got funny again:<br/><br/>My character, Chris Nasser, had a turn of character (the Tilt) and developed a conscience. He turned himself in. He rolled a 0 on the Aftermath, so it was bad news after bad news for him, and a satisfying (if dark) ending for a character none of us really liked. That felt good.<br/><br/>The other two, though? One rolled a 14, and the other rolled a 15.<br/><br/>Oh boy.<br/><br/>Two shining, happy, "the best you could imagine" endings? Not how any of us pictured a fiasco, either. Two out of three characters rode off into the sunset, happy, rich, and smiling. Everything turned out great for them! And we liked them both well enough that it seemed OK... just a bit underwhelming.<br/><br/>We had a fairly fun game in the end, but these challenges caught us off-guard, despite watching the Tabletop episode (all of us) and reviewing the Fiasco book in its entirety (me) an hour before the game. <br/><br/>Not sure what lessons can be taken away from this experience. Should we limit which dice are available for each Act, for instance?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis" title="wdavidlewis"><img alt="wdavidlewis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/256/nEGTDPV2N4H5B.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis">wdavidlewis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456707/#Comment_456707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-28T20:17:42+00:00" title="September 28, 2016  8:17PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2016 8:18PM by wdavidlewis.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure there are many people here with far more experience than I at playing Fiasco, but usually the way it plays out for us with white dice is that the character is getting what they want out of the scene, but it's setup in such a way that it's bad for them in the long term.<br/><br/>e.g. in my last game, the drug dealer (in his scene) was trying to get my character to make a deal to sell him some barrels of meth precursor.  I sold them to him and agreed to deliver them.  He got what he wanted and thus a success in the scene.  But in doing so, he revealed the location of his drug house to me which I intended to rob and then leave no witnesses.  Thus successful in the scene and he was happy. But very bad in the long term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456708/#Comment_456708" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-28T20:33:06+00:00" title="September 28, 2016  8:33PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good tip.

As long as "what I want" is suitable petty and selfish (as it usually should be), this generally results in a fiasco either way.<br/><br/>One helpful approach is to embody short-term thinking: a good short-term solution, for shitty, self-obsessed people, is often less good in the long term. Act without regard to long-term consequences. <br/><br/>Another key is not to pull your punches; a white die is permission, in many cases, to severely fuck up someone else's goals (whether PC or NPC). This is not always obvious to first-time players who still mostly want to cooperate (at least as players in real life). Frame others, kill them, make them lose something they really want, but get away with it in the moment... in many set ups, these end up being immediately "good" for your character, but still ultimately create a huge clusterfuck (which is entirely the point).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456754/#Comment_456754" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-30T21:12:38+00:00" title="September 30, 2016  9:12PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good suggestions, Stephen.<br/><br/>It still doesn't help with the issue of "I'm Establishing this scene for my character... but I also know that it will Resolve positively, so I'm effectively Resolving as well," though.<br/><br/>I think making sure scenes are more actively PvP (so that one character's success is another's downfall) would help with this quite a bit, as well.<br/><br/>However, in our game, the characters were making a rather hopeless and doomed plan together (having bought into each other's lies). When we then created scenes about them trying to pull off their (mutually agreed-upon) plan, that's when things got kind of... deflated. <br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Scene A: Bob tries to convince Julie to do a really stupid thing, which furthers his plans. She gets the black die, which she interprets as giving in, being convinced it's actually a good idea.<br/><br/>Scene B: Julie is trying to pull off the stupid plan Bob talked her into. She gets the white die, so it's a positive outcome for her. None of us can think of a way how it could be good for her without succeeding in the plan (although we did throw in some wrinkles). We also can't think of any way her success might create more problems (Bob, after all, wanted this)... so now what?<br/><br/>It's not an *unsolvable* creative problem (I could come up with something right now, at my keyboard, if I tried hard enough, sure), but in the heat of the moment and three players trying to collaborate on a scene, it wasn't obvious at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456900/#Comment_456900" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-05T20:38:58+00:00" title="October  5, 2016  8:38PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to hear some more feedback on this.

However, in this case, it was sort of the straw on the camel's back at the end of a difficult (and annoyingly "successful" - for the characters - second Act). <br/><br/>We tried - and succeeded - in placing some of the misery on other characters, but our cast was very tight: the three player characters, Chris Nasser's wife, and their dog. (Oh, and two cops who showed up, I suppose - but they had about two lines between the two of them.)<br/><br/>The overabundance of white dice made it really difficult to escalate the action at all in the second Act, and got us these awkward scenes where it felt like the same player was Establishing <i>and</i> Resolving. My character (who rolled a 0 on the Aftermath) was the only one who seemed to get a proper ending. The other two had, at that point, had a string of successful, positive scenes, and had little to say for their epilogues (aside from the clich\xe9d "runs off with the money and buys a small Pacific island" kind of stuff, which didn't really do it for us).<br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456938/#Comment_456938" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T16:24:20+00:00" title="October  7, 2016  4:24PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good practice to avoid it, if you want to avoid it, is to take white dice early, or to keep a metagame eye on how dice are flowing and make choices that keep them roughly even. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456948/#Comment_456948" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T18:36:59+00:00" title="October  7, 2016  6:36PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we definitely didn't do that.<br/><br/>What about the advice in the book to change the balance of black and white?

What you're saying is that in the first act, things are really bad for our protagonists. They just can't get what they want. Nothing is going right. But then something happens (the Tilt) and problems begin to be cleared away.  This is a really good story, so long as you've actually made the bad things in the first act bad enough that clearing them away feels like an accomplishment. If the bad stuff in the first act wasn't so bad, there's your problem. People will really easily lean into bad stuff that's not so bad.  If they're not really hurting after two black-die resolution scenes in a row then maybe that's your problem.<br/><br/>I haven't had this exact thing happen but I've come pretty close and, if you really made bad outcomes bad, then then it feels okay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456963/#Comment_456963" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-08T14:51:18+00:00" title="October  8, 2016  2:51PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2016 2:55PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd never thought of that.  Great point, JD.  I've had plenty of Fiasco moments where "this goes badly for you" merely wound up meaning something awkward or embarrassing -- in retrospect, I think those games suffered from that.  Badness which actually <i>put the character in a significantly worse position going forward</i> was much better.  <br/><br/>A white die coming to someone who just looked foolish is no big deal; a white die coming to someone who looked like they were in line to be murdered is (or at least could be) a dramatic change in direction!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456964/#Comment_456964" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-08T15:43:19+00:00" title="October  8, 2016  3:43PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent point!<br/><br/>Our black die moments, for the most part, were of the "you're getting deeper into trouble - watch out!" kind. This felt good... until the second Act came around and essentially removed all the tension from that.<br/><br/>For instance, one character was bullied/talked into doing something he felt was risky (and against his nature!) in the first Act, and he did so. This felt good; it felt appropriate, and it seemed like it was heading towards a satisfyingly difficult situation! <br/><br/>However, once we saw that there were only white dice left, it wasn't clear what to do next. Of course, the character would try to get out of the trouble... and he did. Not a terribly satisfying turn of events - just when things are getting interesting, the tension disappears.<br/><br/>If we play again, we'll try to really hammer home the black dice as majorly bad turns for the characters, perhaps. (I hesitate a little only because that might feel a little ham-fisted in the initial scenes for each character. Not necessarily, though.)<br/><br/>Would it make sense to conceive of early scenes as either characters  a) doing some bad stuff, which goes well initially but could backfire on them in the future, or that goes well but gets others into trouble (white dice) or b) getting into some major shit (kidnapped, robbed, framed, etc), for black die scenes?<br/><br/>I followed Jason's advice to keep things very down-to-earth (our playset was all the Neighbourhood Association and "is Ned allowed to keep the aluminum foil on his windows? That's against regulations". Here, it didn't work too well, since we *wanted* all of that to go downhill (it wouldn't be terribly interesting if it turned out well!), but didn't get us deep enough in conflict or trouble to make it feel good to climb out of it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456965/#Comment_456965" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-08T16:32:27+00:00" title="October  8, 2016  4:32PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2016 4:33PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the reasons "down-to-earth" works in the source material is because the characters treat it like life and death, and that produces sorts of ironic or tragic tension and humor.  However, if the reality of the situation is <i>too</i> trivial, then the players can wind up in the awkward position of having to choose between (a) keeping the characters relatable but having so little at stake that it's hard to invest in the story or (b) having the characters seem like insane morons for rockin' the whole "powerful ambition, poor impulse control" thing in such mundane circumstances.  I'd aim for a happy medium between bloody gang wars and neighborhood window regulations, like maybe one murder and the threat of more.<br/><br/>Note: When things go badly for characters in Coen Bros movies, it's usually because of something they <i>did</i>, not something that <i>happened</i> to them.  So maybe my "in line to be murdered" was a bad example, and "about to murder someone else" is more like it.  Perhaps a good rule of thumb for getting bang from your black dice could be "push a character to desperation".  How much that takes -- whether it's a situation that would make <i>anyone</i> desperate, or just <i>this</i> fool -- might be a matter of taste to to work out (or just let emerge) at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456968/#Comment_456968" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-08T21:42:22+00:00" title="October  8, 2016  9:42PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds about right, Dave.<br/><br/>What about with the white dice?
