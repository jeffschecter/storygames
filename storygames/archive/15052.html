We had all four: Cleric, Wizard, Thief, Fighter.<br/><br/><b>Characters</b><br/><br/>The Fighter was dungeoneering to pay off his gambling debts, and the Thief owed him a favor for not squealing on him for stealing from a cabal of nobles. The Wizard's master had beef with Grundloch, the dude causing trouble in the Hall Beneath the Hill and trying to awaken the Bloodstone Idol, so the Wizard had hired both the Thief and the Fighter. The Cleric was less tied in, as the player joined the group after character creation and had to hastily do all that and bonds. Cleric wanted to convert the Wizard to his faith, the worship of Anubis, god of death and the underworld.<br/><br/><b>The Dungeon</b><br/><br/>So anyway! They started at the Grand Entrance to the hall, where goblins and lizardmen were standing guard. The Thief tried to find a hidden entrance (Discern Realities) and failed, getting noticed and triggering a fight with the lizardmen. After some hacking and slashing by the Fighter, the Wizard found out the lizardmen worshiped the Frost Heave, an abyssal ice creature (Spout Lore), and Parleyed by giving them a trinket they believed to be a part of the Frost Heave, making his way to the door, with the Cleric. The thief found a trap/secret entrance, but got pushed down it by a goblin. The fighter attacked the goblin, and as battle broke out again jumped down the hole with the thief, while the wizard and cleric made their way through the front door. W &amp; C entered a hall where their weapons began to glow magically, and any held ones began to burn. A ghostly steward greeted them in a booming voice, alerting goblins nearby, who came in the room and attempted to attack but were scared off by the Wizard, who convinced them the magical Peaceguard on the room (causing the heated weapons) was there at his behest.<br/><br/>The Fighter and Thief made their way into the huge goblin warren, the Fighter triggering a rockfall trap in the corridor but escaping in time. They snuck through the goblin encampment to an open ledge, where a giant Idol made of red obsidian with a glowing orb on top stood.<br/><br/>The Wizard and Cleric made it into the same room, though on the opposite side. Both parties were some 50 feet up, looking at each other across the ledge. Goblins had created a makeshift rope bridge across. After some discerning about the idol ("A construct of law and order,") and some shimmying about the ropes, the losing and finding of the Cleric's weapon, and noticing a scrying pool at the bottom of the room, the crew finally were all together and rappelled down the side of the hall with ropes. The ropes broke, sending them tumbling to the bottom, where a goblin mage and lizardmen waited to attack. People took damage, with the Fighter doing his stuff while the Thief used Goldenroot to charm one of the lizardmen into his friend.<br/><br/><b>Grundloch and The End</b><br/><br/>After listening at a large ornate door and attempting to use the scrying pool, the Fighter tried to bash in the door (Bend Bars Lift Gates) but failed, rushing in as Grundlock opened the door and cast a Dominate Person spell on him. The Wizard rushed in and began talking with Grundloch, while the Thief snuck in behind his back. Grundloch's assistant was tied up, and the Wizard realized there was no magical hold over the assistant. The Wizard then revealed his true alignment, convincing Grundloch of the dangers of completing the ritual to awaken the Idol alone, and getting Grundloch to accept his help.<br/><br/>The Cleric (also Evil), attempted to get Grundloch to accept a deal with his Order as Grundloch laid his assistant's body at the foot of the idol, but Grundloch dismissed him as not worthy of his time, and as he turned his back got some Inflict Light Wounds cast on his ass. Then a fight broke out with everyone, Grundloch took a beating, and the Wizard rushed to complete the ritual killing of Grundloch's assistant as Grundloch died. Because the Fighter stepped in to stop the Wizard (7-9 Defy Danger roll on the Wizard's part), the Wizard could choose to complete the ritual just in time, but only if he didn't guard himself at all and took all the damage that was coming at him. He did so choose, and got killed by the Thief and Cleric just as he slaughtered the assistant.<br/><br/>The Wizard failed his Last Breath move, and got visions of the idol turning the entire countryside into dust. The Idol woke up and began burrowing into the Cleric's head. The Thief tried to throw a magical jewel at it, but nothing happened. The party fled then, basically, and the game was over.<br/><br/>I had a good time!<br/><br/><b>Issues</b>, if you don't want to read all that.<br/><br/>-The Cleric player was a random dude hanging at the store, and we were totally happy to welcome him into the game. He contributed pretty well to the game, and picked up the rules even though they were smashing his D&amp;D assumptions. Thing is, though, he was cheating on his fucking rolls, and which spells he had Communed for. I only noticed about 3/4 of the way through (as I was GMing, and my mind is always frazzled when I'm GMing), but at least one of the other players noticed, as well. This made me begin to hate him, and dampened my good vibes for the game for the rest of the way through. I had to start watching his rolls, and if I play with him again, I'm just going to openly call him on cheating. I think that's the only way to deal with this. He also cast Inflict Light Wounds on Grundloch's groin with a kind of subdued, fucked-up glee. <br/><br/>-The cool backstory bond stuff didn't seem to come out in play too much. That's OK, it was a one-shot dungeon crawl, but there was a lot of juiciness there that went unexplored.<br/><br/>-How to adjudicate "cool stuff"? For example, at the end the Thief threw a magical jewel with a soul trapped inside it (that he'd stolen from the Wizard, established in Bonds) at the Bloodstone Idol, trying to do something crazy to it. That didn't seem like any of the moves, and I didn't want to just give him some awesome result without having to risk anything. Plus, the book says the Idol is pretty much impervious to everything. So I said it didn't do anything. I knew that was lame in the moment, but it followed from what was previously established in the fiction, and felt right to me for level 1 characters going up against an idol. The players seemed to want something more, though.<br/><br/>-It was easy to run, but I had read and re-read over the Bloodstone Idol adventure in the book, and I stayed pretty true to it. I'd like to know how the players felt--that is, was it too constrained? Did the dungeon feel canned or alive? I <i>think</i> I could run a dungeon with something less fleshed-out, but I think I'd need some concrete guidelines for Front creation, which this version of DW doesn't have.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's it! Harry, Joel, and Ben were the players (Fighter, Wizard, and Thief*), so if you guys want to chime in, by all means. Plus the cheating fucking Cleric.<br/><br/><br/>*I've left the names out of the AP not because I forgot them or we didn't use them in the game, but really they were incidental to one-shot dungeon crawl play, and I didn't want to clutter up the AP with proper nouns.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342030/#Comment_342030" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-09T01:57:56+00:00" title="September  9, 2011  1:57AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2011 1:59AM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>A couple more things</b>:<br/><br/>-Adventuring Gear? The Thief used this once, and I let him use the stuff he found to Defy Danger for free, not rolling for it. Is that how it's supposed to work? The book just says you "find what you need and mark off a use" but I wasn't sure what that meant--does it give a + to a roll, or what?<br/><br/>-Gold? Many of the characters were ostensibly in search of gold, but they didn't search for it, and whenever there was gold in a room, the Moves snowballed so quickly that it didn't get revealed and they left without it. Doesn't matter so much for a one-shot, but if I run this again I'll think about making Loot a little more obvious.<br/><br/>-The Cleric tried to do a move without doing a Move, once. He was shimmying across the rope bridge in the room with the Bloodstone Idol, his hammer holding him on the rope on one side, his Unholy Symbol holding him up on the other. He got a 7-9 on his Defy Danger roll, so I said that his hammer began to be magnetically attracted by the idol. He could keep going and get across, but his hammer would fly out of his hand and stick to the idol. Or, he could go back and not lose his hammer. He thought about it for what felt like a <i>long</i> time (we had to cut to another character), and then he said, "Okay, I attach it securely to my belt and keep going". I said, "No, you have to make a decision: Do you keep going and lose your hammer, or back down?" He relented and kept going. It was cool to see the rules break his old-school habit of trying to circumvent the situation with clever description.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342031/#Comment_342031" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-09T02:32:29+00:00" title="September  9, 2011  2:32AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite><b>A couple more things</b>It was cool to see the rules break his old-school habit of trying to circumvent the situation with clever description.</blockquote>We've got one player who does this all the time.

He was all about the rigorous academic pursuit of pure knowledge (with tenure, naturally), and seeing great lore in the PROPER hands (his). Connecting Xeno to Grundloch promised to make the adventure a clash between the forces of institutionalized learning and the free and unfettered pursuits of the individual. I'd hired these two louts for his own protection, and while the fighter seemed like a simple down-on-his-luck mercenary, he was destined for greater things--I had FORSEEN it, you see--and I intended to initiate him into a simple understanding of a wider world.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we didn't get to do much of that in play. Adding the other player put a wedge into the dynamic--I repurposed my "I will teach him the true nature of the world" bond for the Cleric, and the other player chose discovering Secrets as the cornerstone of his religion, so there was some awkward overlap there. He also chose the bond "convert Ovid to his religion", but though I tried to engage him in conversation he didn't really step up with fun religious debate or anything. And when we got separated, I lost my chance to engage Gregor the Fighter and Shank the Thief in conversation, so it became more of a dungeon crawl than a character-driven adventure.<br/><br/>The stuff I really enjoyed: Alignment, first of all. While we were filling out the sheets Hans mentioned "you don't have to state which Alignment you picked" and my mind was blown. I quickly decided that my true alignment was Evil (when you bind or control someone through magic...), but that I would play toward the neutral alignment (when you unravel a magical mystery...) being PLAUSIBLE ("I have no need for your paltry moral constructs. The pursuit of pure knowledge is ABOVE that sort of thing!"). It worked out great, even though Hans spilled the beans when I showed him the alignment text to ask him a question on the sly and he read it out loud! It was fine though; I wasn't really trying to hide it from the players, just create some fun in-character tension, which I did!<br/><br/>Faced with a limited Spell choice--I could summon a spirit, or I could Magic Missile the fuck out of everything, or, y'know, create Light--I had fun rocking the Spout Lore plus Parley combo. I'd work out some salient detail about whatever was attacking me, like the Frost Heave that the Lizardmen worship, then offer them a deal of pure bullshit. I passed off a spell component as a relic of the Frost Heave, and as Hans says, convinced the Goblins that it was I who was causing their weapons to overheat through Peacebond, and would surely slay them if they continued to defy it!<br/><br/>I loved playing up the sheer audacity of it--Ovid was imperious, testy, accustomed to being listened to, and assuming he would be obeyed.<br/><br/>INT and CHA were my marked stats, so it was a sure-fire level-up combo, combined with controlling others for Eeeevil! It was fun that I didn't have to actually DO magic for the XP--simply controlling others through THREAT of magic, or through LYING about magic was enough. Doubly delicious because I insisted Grundloch was a "mere charlatan" who did not deserve his power.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see more from Gregor and Shank. They participated physically in the climax, and got a bit of characterization in, but they were overshadowed on the whole, I felt. It was fun when Shank made himself a new Lizardman friend through <i>brain poison</i>, though.<br/><br/>the cheating dude was a problem, yeah. He stuck mainly to physical description (like circumventing the Move result through "cleverness") until the end, when he busted out his "My Order has a message for you Grunloch" stuff in a way that kinda stepped on the toes of other players. Not that it's not cool for him to do his own thing, but he did it in such a weay as to interrupt stated actions. Like "hey, look over here at me instead of resolving that Move!" In fact he did that a lot--trying to interject shit after a Move was rolled and before it was resolved. all in all, not really a team player, in the real people at the table sense.<br/><br/>And the cheating was just UGH. I started to notice it early but couldn't quite confirm it. He set himself up a little lair at his end of the table where within the terrain of his Magic the Gathering box set and the folds of his playbook you couldn't really see the dice he rolled. It became obvious that he was being deliberately secretive, and he got a lot of hits and a LOT of 10+s. Some we saw and were legit, some were doubtful, and a couple I spotted and there's no WAY he had the bonuses to reach a 7 with that roll. I think the only 6- he got was before he understood what number he needed to hit. And when I innocently examined his spell list (to consider taking a spell for my own advance) I discovered he'd been casting spells he didn't have checked off. It was super-blatant but I didn't know how to say anything without sounding like I was, I dunno, suspiciously peering over his shoulder. Which I guess I was.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think it's spot-on for all of us to keep an eye out and whoever's running the game, call out cheating promptly and calmly. (hmm, maybe this should be a whole 'nother topic!)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342072/#Comment_342072" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-09T13:04:38+00:00" title="September  9, 2011  1:04PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I like "The jewel bounces off harmlessly," and they run away.

I played the thief, and in my defense, I mostly threw the gem because it had been in my pocket so long it was burning a plot hole in my cloak.  Basically, it was a loose end I felt needed tying up at the end of a one-shot.  Personally, I was kind of hoping that Frost Heave would jump out of the gem and eat us all, but "Plunk, nothing" tied up the issue just as well.  And a mostly fun night was had by all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I felt the game functioned very well as an AW hack, the rules were just D&amp;Dish enough to be familiar, while still letting the AW rules set up our mentality and drive play forward.  I really enjoyed the idea of bonds.  We ended up creating a neat little intertwined back history for all of us, which sadly didn't get played out too much.  But that often happens in games that last only one session.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only real issue I had was Mr. Cheaty-Face.  Personally, I never noticed him cheating.  What I did notice was that he more or less demanded to be the center of attention and refused to help build the narrative between characters.  More or less I got the distinct feeling he treated everything like a puzzle as opposed to a story (unless he was in the lime-light of course).  It kind of threw me off my game.  At the time I'd attributed the whole thing to the fact that old school habits die hard, but the whole cheating thing has put a more sinister spin on things.  I have my own personal theories on what happened, and cheaters in general, but that should probably be it's own thread.

Hans was running a prepared Dungeon from the book apparently, and he said that the writeup is extremely detailed. He even cut a bunch of rooms out, to fit our time constraints! But the main issue was that there was shit to interact with that we appeared unable to influence.<br/><br/>I TOTALLY get that a measly bunch of level 1-2 tomb robbers would have a hard time controlling an ancient idol of vast malevolent power. But if that's the case it seems like there needs to be A) a way to suss out the limited ways we WOULD be able to affect the idol, and/or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Other stuff to interact with related to the idol.<br/><br/>Now! I can't speak for the dungeon as a whole; we left a lot of ruins unexplored. But from what we DID encounter it seemed that there was an immensely powerful but sleeping idol, a wizard who wanted to activate it for perhaps benign purposes, but it was an "inflexible weapon of pure order," which would lay waste before rebuilding.<br/><br/>All that was awesome, and I had a ton of fun parleying with Grundloch after Spouting Lore about the disastrous effects of the idol: "You can't control it1 It's too much for one man! But I could...HELP you control it." And I wouldn't necessarily expect the ancient dread power to succumb to the effects of, like, randomly throwing stuff at it. But it was unclear to me what exactly we COULD do. "weapon of pure order" doesn't give me much to go on, and most of my Spout Lores didn't give me much more than that (except that last one, warning of the danger). And considering I got the "GM will give you information that is useful" result at least once, it seemed like that was about all the info that was available to have.<br/><br/>It's more than "man, there was just no way for me to control the all-powerful idol" going on, too. Like, when I completed the ritual but then died, and the idol awoke, I expected something horrible to happen. Instead the idol just sat there being scary, while the rest of the party chatted and debated and eventually leisurely made their way out of the cavern. I was expecting everyone to die horribly, or have to run like hell, or something. The lack of dynamism cuts both ways!<br/><br/>I have no idea if this is on Hans or on the adventure, or DW principles, or just a fluke, or what. But it did seem to follow a certain old school ethos, where the stuff is just sitting there to interact with, and if you don't interact with it in the right way...nothing happens. "Nothing" is obviously not as fun as "fabulous success," but it's not as fun as "disastrous failure" either.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that this comes within the context of a game that I enjoyed! I ain't just bellyachin'.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty" title="MummyKitty"><img alt="MummyKitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/582/nF6IT7RM67QPV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty">MummyKitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342109/#Comment_342109" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-09T21:31:17+00:00" title="September  9, 2011  9:31PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2011 9:32PM by MummyKitty.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice session report on Dungeon World.

I might've betrayed the Agenda somewhere. It is, for reference:\n<ul>\n<li>Make the world fantastic</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Fill the character's lives with adventure</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Play to find out what happens</li>\n</ul>\nI definitely could have been more flexible with the Idol. There's nothing in the book that says, "the character's can't do anything with it," it's just that there's nothing for it to really <i>do</i> in the context of the adventure. It's there as the subject of Grundloch's ambitions, serving the countdown clock of, "Does he wake it up and use it to wreck the countryside?" I should've been more flexible and made up stuff you could do with it.<br/><br/>Hm, what I could've done, when you were Spouting Lore and learning about the Idol, was detail whatever process was needed to go through to control the Idol--i.e., what Grundloch was doing. Then you could've decided whether to try and control it, etc. I <i>didn't</i> do that because it felt out of the scope of the adventure, and again, fictionally, it felt like you guys weren't powerful enough.
