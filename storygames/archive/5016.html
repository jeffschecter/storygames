The game is about telling interesting stories about the interactions that come about between people of dysfunction and oddity, something alla Pushing Daisies. I wrote an entire review of the game and experience here: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muragami.wishray.com/?p=8" rel="nofollow">Complications &amp; Mess</a>. Its not totally flattering, but this is only playtest <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, and I think its rather fair. Overall I had a good time, and hope the game will rock.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
