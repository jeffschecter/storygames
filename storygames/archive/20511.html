It basically ends when someone finally decides it is time to look into it.<br/><br/>- Chapter 2 is about chasing leads and rumors. It is more about understanding what questions to ask, than getting any real answers. It ends where they get somewhere that might hold a concrete answer.<br/><br/>- Chapter 4 is about the Evil becoming more and more invasive and manifest in the TOs lives, up to the point when they actually face it.<br/><br/>- Chapter 5 is about finding a solution or a way out.<br/><br/>With all of this in mind we might see Chapter 3 as the one where the TOs <b>act</b> to <b>get</b> the answer. At least one TO got access to a place that might (somehow) offer answers... so now it's all about doing stuff to get the answer.<br/><br/>But yes, on a more "meta" level, this should also be the Chapter about a mental/moral/physical <b>descent</b>. It's about <b>exploration</b> or, narratively speaking, <b>exposition</b>: you just got access to the dark place so now the story might show you stuff.<br/>In Chapter 1 and 2 you are in the normal/safe world and something is wrong... in Chapter 3 you step into an abnormal/unsafe world.<br/><br/>It might also be a moment of realization.<br/>In Chapter 4 the Evil starts being more manifest, maybe because (narratively) in Chapter 3 you ended up realizing that there actually is an "Evil", so now there's little point in hiding it.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>To sum up these confused ideas, Chapter 3 might be about:<br/>- some kind of "descent"<br/>- exploration / exposition of an abnormal/unsafe reality<br/>- acting to get answers<br/>- realisation (but not confrontation, not solid proof) that there is an Evil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450797/#Comment_450797" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T13:36:55+00:00" title="January 21, 2016  1:36PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            maybe when a TO "catches a glimpse" of the evil?

But one thing I would like is for the key to be as clear and practical as possible, like the other ones.<br/><br/>All other keys might be interpreted in many ways, but in the end it is something you can SEE in the fiction.<br/>The moment a character realizes something is wrong AND acts to solve it, is always obvious.<br/>The moment a character accesses an underground place that might hold answers, is always obvious.<br/>The moment a character faces the Evils, is always obvious.<br/><br/>I mean, sometimes the Player will push toward it and announce "I'm turning the key".<br/>But a lot of other times the Player is just describing what her character says and does, and someone else will notice and say "this is a key being turned".<br/><br/>So what do we have as suggestions for <b>Chapter 3 - Descent</b>?<br/>The chapter ends when a Touched One...<br/><br/>...agrees to sacrifice a portion of their humanity.<br/>...catches a glimpse of the Evil.<br/>...accepts the truth.<br/>...learns the truth (and has proof).<br/>...accepts the evil as part of herself.<br/>...opens himself to the evil (cuts a deal, reads the wrong book, etc.).<br/>...loses some part of herself to the evil (sacrifices a moral linchpin or a physical something they hold dear).<br/>...pokes the evil (e.g. purposefully and knowingly  acts against it).<br/>...discovers a secret about the evil.<br/>...accepts a way they are similar to the Evil.<br/>...learns something about the Evil.<br/>...X hours have gone by, and the sun comes up.<br/>...journeys out of the underground back into the light (back the way they came, or out the other side).<br/><br/>Now, all the ones about learning the "truth" are off simply because the Touched Ones might actually never learn it, the story is supposed to (if it plays out that way) end with no real explanation of what was going on and why.<br/><br/>The ones about glimpsing the Evil are off too, as it conflicts with the 4th Key. I mean, a glimpse is not the same as facing, but my intention is to NOT reveal the Evil until the very final Chapter; not directly at least.<br/><br/>The introspective ones (evil is part of you, lost humanity, open to the evil) are exceedingly cool and I love them... but they are no good, I fear, as they all assume a level of knowledge and understanding (or even interaction!!!) of the Evil that is simply not part of the story at that moment.<br/><br/>A literal journey "back to the light" is very interesting too but has two deal breaker problems.<br/>The first is that it makes sense only for the character that accessed an underground location but not for anyone else (in the game the PCs might never meet, but the story always progresses for them all).<br/>The second is that it would represent a release of tension, a cathartic moment, out of the dark and back into the light; I can't have this, the story is a slow downward spiral, it starts slob but never stops, decreases or backpedals. <br/><br/>Poking the Evil, discovering stuff about it, there are all conditions used to end the whole story in chapter 5.<br/><br/>mmm ... tough stuff &gt;_&lt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450849/#Comment_450849" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-24T01:40:08+00:00" title="January 24, 2016  1:40AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hasimir,<br/><br/>I am not even remotely familiar with your game, so please take all my advice with a grain of salt - it's possible that it's not relevant because of some detail about how your game works.<br/><br/>Having said that, here's my uninformed opinion:<br/><br/>1. Given that the game already has lots of triggers about the nature of the evil and exploring it, a focus on the internal character's role would be very fitting (traditionally, this happens in this kind of story around the midpoint, as well).<br/><br/>2. Triggering events that come from the outside of the character should be objectively defined enough that there is no ambiguity. Entering an underground place or facing a source of Evil is fairly unambiguous, so it probably works really well in that regard.<br/><br/>However, when something is internal to the character, it's often enough to treat that trigger "both descriptively and prescriptively" (as Vincent Baker would say). I designed a game where one of the rules kicks in if the character "does something stupid, irrational, or desperate". That's pretty vague, right? <br/><br/>Well, turns out there's a very easy way to make very clear. When someone says that the rule applied, I simply ask them: "OK, why is that? How is what you're doing stupid, irrational, or desperate?" And they immediately tell me something really useful ("Oh, it's stupid because I'm not paying any attention to the guy behind me who's obviously a traitor" - Ah, ok! Now we know.).<br/><br/>The same thing might work here. If you have trigger like, "The character crosses a moral line", you can ask the player to explain why they feel it's relevant. (After all, they wouldn't be calling for it unless they thought it applied - so all they have to do now is verbalize it, and you're golden.)<br/><br/>For the purpose of playtesting, I don't see why you couldn't lay out two or three options you really like on the table, and then ask players to use whichever one seems most relevant or applicable. You'll get a sense pretty quick of which ones work the way you want them to and which ones do not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450851/#Comment_450851" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-24T10:45:22+00:00" title="January 24, 2016 10:45AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Too bad I can't give a Plus or a Like to posts ... so here it is in more verbose form: thanks Paul (and everyone else) for the input! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Specific suggestions might not be 100% ok right out of the box, but they spark good conversations that, in turn, help me immensely in focusing and clearing my ideas.<br/><br/>Today I have the second part of the latest playtest, I'll try some things, I'll let you know how it goes ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheRoleplayer" title="TheRoleplayer"><img alt="TheRoleplayer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheRoleplayer">TheRoleplayer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450985/#Comment_450985" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-30T15:57:25+00:00" title="January 30, 2016  3:57PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Late to the party, and I'm not familiar with the game at this point either, but just by reading this thread I think if your chapter 3 had something like a plot twist as a moment of misconception from the protagonists, it would help make the next chapters even more intense.
