They leave civilization and invade an underground complex filled with traps and hostile animals and people.  They are patently risking their lives in this endeavor.  The payoff?  Some material wealth, some experience/life lessons/practical training, and some gear that will help them do it again the next month.  Now, the payoff is not so great that they can retire for the rest of their lives or anything -- they are supporting themselves for maybe a month or three.<br/><br/>Is risking your life for three months' livelihood a worthwhile trade?  What would <em>make</em> it worthwhile -- is mundane life really that bad?  Is the payoff actually better than it seems?  Is the payoff something that can't be got any other way and is essential to keeping their families at home alive?  And this is something that they do <em>regularly</em> -- this isn't for the one big payoff that can buy back the farm from foreclosure; this is a <em>way of life</em>.  They will do it again, and again, and again, until they die, or... or is there some long-term goal that makes all the risk and work worthwhile?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132446/#Comment_132446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T17:45:02+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  5:45PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa!

I know you expressly said this isn't about the one big payoff, but this sort of behaviour seems to draw more people (in our, real, lives here on Earth)--unpredictable rewards, to me, explain this kind of "work" better than any sort of thing which produces a fairly reliable payoff. You're always hoping the next big loot bag will contain that one item that's worth so much you can finally retire...<br/><br/>2. Seen from this angle, it's hard to imagine dungeoneers NOT glancing at each other mistrustingly, planning to betray each other, or gently nudging one's least favourite ally (or most worrisome rival) down that corridor _first_, so they'll fall into whatever traps lie in wait.

If the game tells you how everyone dreams of the big score (What would that be, anyway? The Head of Vecna or something?), but the system only gives you a slight chance of scoring, say, three or four times what might be a good return on your adventure, I think people would still buy into that. "Oh, I get it. The truly legendary stuff only happens off-screen, or at the end of the game... but you can still get rich and lucky. Let's play!" (Something like the Transcendence mechanics from TSoY, perhaps?)<br/><br/>As for fame, one way to do it would be to set the game in a world with some very famous collection of items that can be found--like the eleven pieces of the Shattered Artifact Lost Long Ago. Everyone's hunting the treasure, and the going's good as it is, but they all do it because they hope that one day they'll find one of those Pieces. That dude in the other city found one and the King made him a Duke!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132454/#Comment_132454" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T18:04:50+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  6:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh,<br/><br/>You seem to be taking the meta-game and making it the text of the fiction.

Second, just because the players know that "the one big score" will never come does not mean that the characters also realize this.

In another world they'd turn to banditry or become mercenaries.  But the war left underground dungeons, abandoned fortresses, mysterious islands, and forgotten ruins strewn across the world, filled with failed magical experiments, alien mercenaries, deserters, war constructs, mad generals still fighting the war, and of course, treasure.  <br/><br/>The PCs are the ones who can't settle down, who can't let the past lie.  All around them are people struggling to move on from the war, rebuilding shattered lives.  The PCs are digging up past wrongs, literally delving into forgotten history.  Not because they're looking for adventure, not because they don't want to move on, but because they don't know anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132464/#Comment_132464" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T18:56:23+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  6:56PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite>And if my PC finds the mother lode that allows him to retire, and I still want to play him... where does that leave me?</blockquote>\nEver watch a documentary about folks who do crab fishing, or that one with the truckers on the ice roads?<br/><br/>There are folks who do it because they hear the money is good.

Just a couple of average joe's. They stop in at Town 1-A,  grabbing some weapons and grub before they go on their first expedition together. And while they're in town, news of what they're about to attempt leaks into the village (after all, it always does). People learn that this group of snot-nosed punks are going to attempt to take down, without any sort of backup, the dark threat that has loomed over them their entire lives. They scoff. Of course they scoff.<br/><br/>The heroes take their leave.<br/><br/>A week goes by, and no one heres a peep from our fateful heroes.<br/><br/>And after two weeks, people start to worry. They start to wonder. The children play make believe about how these heroes have surely defeated the red wyrm. No one quite believes it, but they prefer believing that to believing that they let innocent youth walk to their doom in some abyssal vacant lot.<br/><br/>The heroes gave an expected return date. And on that date, the townsfolk just happen to gather in the town square. And they just happen to bring with them celebration supplies. Not that any of them are expecting anything. And... oh?... what's that on the horizon? Six bloodied, battered, young snot-nosed punks. And one of them is holding the head of the great red wyrm.<br/><br/>The bards take the story on the road immediately. By the time the heroes are done with their celebrations, news has already hit Town 1-B. And when they get there, the villagers gladly give them maps and supplies. These are the fabled warriors! And the celebration this time is bigger, because the villagers expected them to succeed. By the time they hit Town 1-E, they are famous and beloved and highly spoken of.<br/><br/>But then they hit Town 2-A. And no one knows their name. No one believes in them. They are most certainly not celebrities. But they hear rumor of an albino troll that's been menacing the countryside recently.<br/><br/>And already they can feel the surge of excitement. The taste of glory.<br/><br/>God only knows how good 2-E is going to feel when they hit it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132544/#Comment_132544" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T06:45:52+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  6:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe: When I play RBH, I always make sure that the townsfolk tell my stories before I leave.

That struck me as very much the modern day equivalent of the dungeon-delving adventuring group.  These guys do amazing things in dangerous places, risking their lives and being superstars, but they're basically just in it for the money.  And although the payoff (if there is one) is huge, their operations and personal tastes are expensive, so they'll keep going out to sea again and again.<br/><br/>I guess it seems like one motivation you could use is simply that the adventurers aren't the sort of people that are cut out for mundane life- they're thrill-seekers with expensive habits and rock-star attitudes.

In the Giants modules, there's a background blurb that explains that the Duke has sent the PCs. OK, why he didn't send a larger army is a good question... the Fellowship of the Ring is explained in the volume of that name, as requiring secrecy, hence it's small size (no army could be large enough). <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically there's no way to make economic sense of this model in any realistic way. In the real world, nobody would do it. David's example of cavers notwithstanding... what is the actual percentage of caving outings that end up in death? A careful caver can expect to survive. Since his "foe" is the cave, his odds of success lie mostly in how careful he plans and proceeds. With a mortal foe, you have something working actively and creatively against you, and that's just too unpredictable. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere has to be some rationale. It's not hard to come up with one, however. For one, the adventurers could simply go in always not expecting too much opposition. Consider that Howard Carter could be relatively certain that there would be no monsters in his expedition to find egyptian mummies. The fact that so many people associated with the discovery died does not deter anyone from being an archeologist today. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n"Dungeoneers" would simply have the same sort of assumptions. That they aren't going to run into trouble that they can't handle with near 100% success rates. That is, I think that they think that the dungeons are basically empty. And are surprised when they find things living there... <br/>\n<br/>\n...after all it's usually pretty surprising. I mean why has that band of gnolls ended up living here in this old crypt, anyhow? <br/>\n<br/>\nEarthdawn, if I'm remembering correctly, goes somewhat in this direction. The "kaers" that people go looking through, are expected to be abandoned, perhaps even long looted. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this leaves two problems:<br/>\n1. Hey, there are GNOLLS here! When the group discovers the gnolls, the fact that they decide to take them on is interesting. Perhaps they figure that they can ambush the gnolls, and that these three here are the only ones in the crypt. The rationale for attacking, however, is viable... banditry has been an occupation forever, and taking people's stuff is good enough reason for some. Given that they're "evil" beings, it's not even really banditry from their POV. But they do have to have numbers, or surprise, or something, else rushing a 7 foot tall hyena-man sounds like a bad idea to me. <br/>\n2. Why is it that in every crypt we delve into, there are GNOLLS! For no particularly good reason, other than the phenomenon seemed to smack me most with this show, I call this the Magnum PI effect. Why is it that week after week Magnum is falling for yet another beautiful client, and getting into shootouts... with folks in Hawaii? I mean any one of his adventures is pretty plausible, but week after week? Don't you think he'd switch careers to nighttime security if he knew that he was going to get shot at so much? <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe this is better thought of as the "ER" effect. Huh, somebody got shot in the ER AGAIN? Wow, how many does that make now? Almost as many as explosions that have rocked the ER. What sane person would work in that hospital with it's record? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is simply an intrinsic problem with the episodic format. I think you simply have to hand-wave it. Yeah it's damn odd that there's horrors in every Kaer you come across. That every crypt has gnolls in it. But, hey, what can you do? The next one will be easy, right? Has to be. We've certainly killed off all of the gnolls in this area, no? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's another solution, too. Which is that these adventurers happen to know that they are simply better than their likely opposition. This has three problems, however:<br/>\n1. The system usually doesn't support this. Fact is that even in D&amp;D, things can and will go wrong. In this case the promise of ressurection is what must keep em going (don't get me started on what this would mean culturally). <br/>\n2. It drains some of the heroism. If they know that they're able to kick ass, then it's not nearly as brave for them to charge the 2HD gnolls. <br/>\n3. It's just weird. Why do they keep coming up against foes that are precisely the right difficulty for them to take out? Good research? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA while back there was an idea that somebody had to use dungeons as resolution systems. The reason I bring this up is because the dungeon was always spurred by some rationale that was created to support the need to go into it. Want to win the affection of the princess? Then we'll put her at the end of the selected dungeon, and if they get there, her hand is won. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like this. Just create a rationale that's compelling for the character, each time a dungeon comes up. Make it an explicit part of the process - one that usually happens implicitly anyhow, where a player says, "My character is itching to hit the road again..." or whatever. Modify the dungeon to take these things into account. Is the character's goal fame? Then there's always some idol to get that owning it will make him famous, or some deed to be done in the adventure that will make his name known far and wide. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what's not going to work is to try to come up with some economic model that explains folks traipsing into mortal danger for cash. Either they don't expect much trouble, or they know that they can take care of the trouble. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may simply be easier to just handwave the whole thing... given that's what people have done for decades. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132637/#Comment_132637" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T10:12:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2008 10:12AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>3.

How is that the big main baddie is just strong enough to make the PCs sweat, but not too much so they stand no chance against him? Surely, I play along with the formula, since it allows the game to remain fun for everyone... But it still bugs me from once in a while.<br/><br/>And the gnoll thing is pretty much why I try to avoid "crypt raids" as much as possible. I prefer to justify my adventures one way or another. One is in a natural cave where the monster hides, the next is in an abandoned manor they looked shelter at during a storm, the next is at a non-abandoned inn where something happened...

We already have a lot of these games.  I think we've got this one handled.  Everybody on this forum can easily bullshit a reason for their character to risk their lives.<br/><br/>Thing is, that's appropriate when the band of PCs are basically the only dungeon-delvers out there.  Maybe there's one other rival team for plot interest and character foils.  But, by and large, what we're talking about is individual and personal reasons to go dungeon-delving.  I want to reconfigure things to create a <em>cultural, economic</em> reason to go dungeon-delving.  A reason or reasons that are broad-based and ubiquitous, so that dungeon delving is a recognized (if not respected) sort of career track.<br/><br/>To that end, we have the following suggestions so far:<br/><br/><strong>The Libertarian "The System is Irrevocably Bad for the Human Spirit" thing</strong> -- Life in medieval times is nasty, brutish, and short!    Dungeon delving is a preferable alternative to a life of drudgery.  Yes, subsistence farming sucks.  In medieval times, the farmers are usually serfs, and the reason they don't leave is because they're not legally allowed to, and if you try the baron's knights will run you down on their horses and surround you with pikes and march you back to the farms. Now -- if you had equipment for dungeon-delving (a trusty sword, a little armor, and the ability to cast magic missile), why the heck aren't you mounting an insurrection?  Serfs stayed at their tasks because they did not have the resources to overcome their oppressors.  If they did have those resources, why in the blue blazes would they go tearing off into a dungeon? <br/><br/><strong>The Modern Libertarian Version:</strong>  Or, alternately, real life is terrible, and adventure is categorically better, because it's <em>exciting!</em>  Ron says that if it were economically viable, he'd choose adventuring over his current life.  Well... would you really?  Or put it this way: if you went through your first 'adventure' and had to put a sword in the gut of two dozen 'monsters' who are clearly civilized, would you really do it again?  And if <em>you</em> would, do you think you're representative of a large segment of the population?<br/><br/><strong>Remi's Monster Pogrom</strong>  I can see this, and Roger's holy war variant.  I'm not sure if I'd want to <em>play</em> it -- or at least, I don't know if I'd want to play it without the ability and systemic support to turn away from the genocide and try to subvert the system that put me and countless other youths in that situation.  Which, admittedly, sounds like a  fun game, but it's veering off from what I'm aiming at.<br/><br/>Here's Tristan, who I'm just going to quote:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite>Some do it for the fame ("people will tell my tales, bards will sing my name, children will play to be me!"), some for the money (greed is a funny thing: once you hit the big pot, you are only thinking about the next big treasure there is... ask Bill Gates!), some for the thrill of adventure (I think of them as the professional extreme sportsmen of the time), some out of boredom and monotony (we have had enough "pig farmer" examples, haven't we?), some out of "scientific curiosity" ("Haven't you heard? Albino Troll's blood is the prime ingredient in KFC secret "dragon wings" recipe...") and some can even have some obscure, personal reasons ("My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!").  Just as in real life, not everyone chooses his profession by the same reasons.</blockquote>\nSome of this is the individual and situational stuff that I'd want to get away from, but the others are all different takes on essentially the same thing.  There is value to be gained in the dungeon that isn't available elsewhere.  There is the fame that I'll talk about in the next bullet point.  There is material wealth, there are rare substances (and presumably, phenomena), there is excitement.  Now the question becomes -- what makes the dungeon the locus of those things, and more importantly, what makes it the <em>exclusive</em> locus of those things?  Why is there no better, perhaps less-riskier, option, for accruing fame, wealth, knowledge, excitement?  What makes the dungeon special?<br/><br/><strong>To Become a Famous Hero (note the caps)</strong>  Okay, I can totally get on board with this idea, especially if there's a culture that celebrates these "dungeon heroes."  But -- the games that we have so far do not support this very well.  I would love to play this game, but I can't think of a system that would actually reward me for becoming famous.  So here's the question -- what would that system look like, and how would it be mirrored in the world and setting?<br/><br/><strong>Adrenaline Junkies</strong> I think there's a very large difference between caving, which is certainly seriously dangerous, and fighting your way through a band of gnolls, a cave troll, and countless traps <em>designed to kill you</em>, only to pit your mettle against a fire breathing dragon.  Yes, caving has serious dangers that require respectful care, etc etc -- but can we all agree that there's an order of magnitude difference between caving and "adventuring?"  Extreme sports and adrenaline-junkie pasttimes are relatively safe -- they're spiced with danger.  Dungeoneering is dangerous, period -- it's not spiced with danger, it is just popping the cayenne pepper of danger into your mouth.  Some really crazy folks might do it exclusively for the thrill, but I'd think they'd be in the minority.

If it's your sacred duty to put goblins to the sword, who is going to dare say it's anything but zealous devotion?  I'm really feeling the proxy thing myself.  Somebody needs to fight the monsters or civilization will be overrun (that's the party line, anyway).  Civilization develops institutions to provide these people, despite the fact that it is a suicidal and horrific task.

You're keeping your family safe. You're not really murdering them, because they're trying to kill you, and they're not only dangerous, they're fanatical killers belonging to a crazy religion and they can't be reasoned with.<br/><br/>The alternative is to simply sit back and wait for them to strike at you and destroy all that you hold dear. Some in your village may try to say that the monster threat isn't all that bad, but what about when Bannard's Fording got wiped out by the  hordes of evil? Do you really want that to happen to your home? Have you really forgotten about Bannard's Fording already?<br/><br/>Of course, by the time you've gone down in the dungeon and fought the killers and defended your town, you've changed. You're blooded. You may be a hero back home, but they -- the people who cowered in your home and ignored the threat -- they just don't understand what you went through.  They don't understand the horrors you faced, the traps that could have killed you, the monsters which did try to kill you, and all the bodies and blood. They weren't <i>there</i>, man.<br/><br/>Only your fellow adventurers do, and you only have one thing in common: You know how to go in a dungeon and fight to protect those people who don't really understand. You do it because it's all you can do.<br/><br/>You're fighting for a society you no longer belong to, that puts you on a pedestal even as they don't really understand you. And you're only as good as the last threat you eliminated; once the dungeon is cleared, they don't need you any more. You're a soldier without a war; a burden to everyone else. And they may even turn on you.<br/><br/>So it's on to the next dungeon, the next big adventure.

(I may not <i>agree</i> with the justifications, but they exist and they work for many, many people.)<br/><br/>One way to make it "not murder" is to make it "war." Another is to make it "self-defense."<br/><br/>Dungeon-delving almost always includes killing things, and what's more, knowing you're going to kill things -- or at the very least, run into things that want to kill you. (And the best way to prevent them from killing you is to kill them first.)<br/><br/>In your list of reasons for dungeon-delving, I see that you've left off "community defense." I think that's a big omission, because one of the standard tropes of the fantasy adventure setting is not just that the monsters down there are big and bad and dangerous, but also that if they're not destroyed, they will come and get you.<br/><br/>They're not merely situational enemies, which, if you leave the dungeon alone, won't come and bother you. They're not the haunted house on the corner which only gets you if you enter through the creaky gate out front -- they're the graveyard full of the living dead which will shamble out at the next full moon and eat your friends.<br/><br/>A dungeon is basically a den of evil; a terrorist training camp. If you allow it to fester, the evil cult or archmage or lich or orc tribe or dragon will come and kill <i>you</i>. The only, only way to prevent this is to take the fight to them before it's too late.<br/><br/>I'm not damning this, I'm celebrating it. The setup is clearer to me than to some other people, apparently: dungeon-delving isn't just about getting rich and doing a job, it's about saving civilization (or parts thereof) from an existential threat. You don't do it because you want to make money -- become a merchant or a craftman, for crying out loud! -- but because otherwise, the dragon will come out of the ground and burn your home down.<br/><br/>(One of the reasons I say I'm celebrating is that I have a strong, strong preference as a DM for heroes who do take that kind of "heroic" view of the world around them, rather than those who only operate for financial gain. I don't believe that dungeon-delving can work in many other circumstances. The only good for-profit justification, as I see it, involves the establishment of some kind of large "industry," such as an Adventurers Guild or a Royal Library, that pays people to go in dungeons and report back to them. And that seems too contrived.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132691/#Comment_132691" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T12:00:06+00:00" title="March  5, 2008 12:00PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite><strong>To Become a Famous Hero (note the caps)</strong>Okay, I can totally get on board with this idea, especially if there's a culture that celebrates these "dungeon heroes."

committing repeated murder in order to enrich themselves. Looking at history, that's half the fun of war, you get to loot whichever city or town or civilization you just overran and when you get home, you get to retire for the rest of your life and drink while you watch your fresh slaves work the fields (if you're Roman) or hang out in the mead-hall and pound em down while talking about the salt-wives you picked up (if you're a viking) or whatever it is Mongols did in middle-age. <br/>\nThese societies had farmers and craftsmen, but it's sometimes easier to go to the next town over and kill a couple people and take their stuff. So the risks are larger when you go into a dungeon full of "monsters" but the rewards are much bigger. By the time an adventurer in 3.5 is 10th level, he could buy a whole town for his own amusement if he cashed in all of his magical adventuring gear. <br/>\nAnd you know why it's not murder? Because you did it OVER THERE, instead of OVER HERE where your family is. So it's cool. And everybody thinks you're awesome. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in my opinion, the real question is how risk-averse a person needs to be to exist in a pre-modern society of this type and not go out for the "easy" money. <br/>\nAnd in something like D&amp;D, when do you call it quits? 10th level and be an earl? 15th when you can set yourself up as a count? 20th when you can be a prince or a king? 30th when you're an interdimensional god?<br/>\nI've always believed that in any D&amp;D world, there are a bunch of adventurers who called it quits after they nailed down 5,000 gold or 10,000 gold and just went home because they're set for life. They made it to 6th level! Woo hoo! Time to cash in on the hookers and blow!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132695/#Comment_132695" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T12:13:35+00:00" title="March  5, 2008 12:13PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: KynnSorry, I wasn't damning it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey're not merely situational enemies, which, if you leave the dungeon alone, won't come and bother you. They're not the haunted house on the corner which only gets you if you enter through the creaky gate out front -- they're the graveyard full of the living dead which will shamble out at the next full moon and eat your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nA dungeon is basically a den of evil; a terrorist training camp. If you allow it to fester, the evil cult or archmage or lich or orc tribe or dragon will come and killyou.

So here's the question -- what would that system look like, and how would it be mirrored in the world and setting?</blockquote>\nWouldn't it look like the Forgotten Realms?<br/><br/>As much as I'll fling poo at the signature characters of the FR (Elminster and Drizz't and those other jerks), they are undeniably celebrities within that setting.  The entire FR campaign book is full of adventurers who became or are clearly on their way to becoming celebrities, with wealth and power and influence galore.  They're not just NPC antagonists or allies or local color, they are invitations to player characters to seek exactly the same kind of status, and an example to GMs to let them know that "Famous Hero" is a valid career choice in the Realms.<br/><br/><br/>Now, there's no system or mechanics built into D&amp;D to explicitly handle fame (other than the Leadership feat, I guess), but the <i>culture</i> of celebrity is definitely built right in.  I suppose you could look at it as a reversal of a fame mechanic -- instead of the game measuring your fame and then awarding you power and wealth and hot chicks, you're told to amass power and wealth and hot chicks and then expect the game to award you the fame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132702/#Comment_132702" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T12:34:35+00:00" title="March  5, 2008 12:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, yeah, sort of -- in fact, I was thinking of Agon and its Glory emphasis as I wrote.

Here's <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/reputation.htm" rel="nofollow">the latest semi-canonical stab at reputation</a> in D&amp;D 3.5, from the <i>Unearthed Arcana</i> book. (There's also an <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/honor.htm" rel="nofollow">honor system</a> in the same book.)<br/><br/>Some of the more recent D&amp;D books introduce affiliations with scores in those groups based on what you do; it's like reputation with specific factions in World of Warcraft. (As opposed to reputation in the link above, which is more a measure of your overall celebrity than your standing with a particular group.)  A few of the newer books even have prestige classes and other game mechanics which are dependent upon these affiliation scores, rather than as a distinct sub-system.<br/><br/>WoW's by-faction reputation system also is probably worth a look. You can spend hours "grinding rep" in WoW and not actually make any levels or finish any quests, but your status within a certain group goes up. This translates into specific rewards at certain reputation levels. Maybe you're not that concerned about leveling up or getting random drops of treasure, but you know that if you go out and spend your time doing things to benefit the Academy of the Blade, they'll eventually reward you with the Sword of the Blademaster and the accompanying title and prestige.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132710/#Comment_132710" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T13:03:18+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  1:03PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2008 1:12PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a problem with the plausibility of murdering sentients on a mass scale. Nazis, anyone? Not visceral enough? Roman gladiators killing Christians? The Mongols... pretty much all the time? <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, I don't have a problem with this being heroic. It might not be everybody's cup of tea, but in a world with elves and fireballs, I'll have no problem swallowing objectively evil orcs. Think of orcs as folks that kill because they get off on it. Like Jeffrey Dahmer evil. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou'd kill a race like that, if it existed... wouldn't you? I would. If I categorically knew that they were all irredeemably this way. Not a realistic situation, but, then, that's not why we play fantasy. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, does that teach us to think of other humans as potentially deserving of this sort of treatment? Ehhh, I dunno. Doesn't teach me that. I can't worry too much about what others will take from stuff, when I don't. It certainly isn't a neccessary end state. Any more than video games causing violence. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now we're talking monsters. The thing about monsters is that they're dangerous. If they don't have any compunction about killing you at all, then they're maximally dangerous. There's nothing in the world so dangerous to a human as another trying to kill him. So the question at hand is still... why would you go looking for this sort of danger? <br/>\n<br/>\nSoldier? Yes, absolutely. That's why we have armies and soldiers, so we can train men to have an attitude where they will follow orders for the general good of those that the army serves. Despite the relatively high probability of mortality. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the problem here is the conformity. You need a "unit." Some standard to conform to. A dungeoneering squad always seems to be comprised of ruggedly independent sorts. I find it hard to see them giving of themselves for the good of the community. Then again, Han Solo does come back to save Luke...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we're back to the rewards. Women and money. Either you have military units that are involved in this sort of thing, or there has to be a huge economic advantage to being in this career (the potential to bag the princess or get "more money than you can imagine"). But, as Josh notes early, if that's true, then early retirement is in the cards. Why have high risk without comensurate rewards? And, again, if the rewards are worth it, why not send in an army to get them? <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically it breaks the basic "cost-benefit-analysis" model. There is no ongoing economic model where the downside is worse than the upside. And dying 100% trumps profit - how can you enjoy your phat lewt, if you're dead? There is NO incentive in the world, short of retirement in luxury, that makes it worth the risk of dying. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this leaves you with the situation like:<br/>\n"Every time we're certain that there's a huge trove, but, man... we never actually get it. It's always only enough for a few months of expenses and partying. When will we hit the mother lode?" <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's either going to smack of episodicity (if you will), or seem like the characters are insane for continuing to try. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that you're asking for a solution to this problem, Josh, but to me it seems like you're asking "How can I make down into up?" To which I can only reply... you can't. Think of it this way... in all the man-years of D&amp;D play out there, none of these creative sorts has solved the problem so far, I don't believe. I don't think it's forthcoming. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I'm usually wrong. The POV just has to be stated. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Henchman have a mechanical effect... they fight for you. They're your own little army. It's an odd artifact of AD&amp;D1E, and many (most?) groups sorta ignore these effects, leaving the henchmen home to guard the castle. But the notion is that these dudes are there to fight for you. Heck, it indicates what level they are. And talks about what it takes to replace dead henchmen. They're even expendable!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132717/#Comment_132717" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T13:27:44+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  1:27PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albert A</cite>So... be a farmer in a sucky world... or go adventuring, and if you succeed enough times, become the king of your own little plot of land, with vassals who are loyal to you and your own set of serfs to push around.</blockquote>\nThis is probably the point where I chime in about Mythender, since that sort of plot is exactly what Mythender is being built to do (though, admittedly it's more like the end of that story than the years of building up to it).  Compared to the average idea, this is highly specialized, but the concept is similar -- people travel to a strange location to kill beasts and take their stuff (which, in this case, is raw mythic power rather than something physical).  Only, and here's where it's kinda important and relevant to this idea: said beasts aren't actually harming the PCs prior to the adventure.  They aren't going their because they're getting paid by some Duke.  The PCs are killing this dragon because they have an entirely separate goal outside of this mythic land, and killing this dragon (as well as converting the land) will aid them in that goal.  That's a similar reason to why folks do any dangerous job -- it's quick money to, say, buy a house when you otherwise have shit-all for it.<br/><br/>As for the "why to keep doing it" part, well, money &amp; power are two things that run out.  You might not be able to becoming king or bring your wife back from the dead with just one dragon under your belt -- just like you might not be able to pay for your house completely with just one season of dangerous work.  So, you keep doing it to get further to your goal.  Eventually you get noticed for your hard work -- in the real world, maybe you're a crab fisherman who get noticed and promoted, eventually getting your own boat.  In Mythender, a pagan god notices you and challenges you to a fight where, should you survive, you'll have all the mythic power you'll even need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132728/#Comment_132728" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T13:57:27+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  1:57PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2008 1:58PM by Tristan.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many times, soldiers have a lot of problems about murdering people mainly because they don't know for sure the other person deserved it.<br/><br/>His enemy had a family, possibly children, a duty and a life.<br/><br/>Higher Goals might serve him justify it, but down deep inside he might feel like he is doing the wrong thing.<br/><br/>Now, lets consider two facts.<br/><br/>First, we cannot base our Dungeon Delvers in modern Moral Standards.

Then the horrors of the planet tore their settlements apart, slaughtered their people, even reached out to bat their satellites out of the sky.  Now, they huddle close for protection beneath the domes -- alien constructions of a long-dead race that keep the horrors at bay.  The only problem is, the domes are fueled by power crystals the colonists only barely understand, and cannot produce themselves.  There are more power crystals... out there, in the dead alien bunkers, filled with unspeakable horrors and forgotten, incomprehensible technology.  If the colonists want to survive, a few of them must risk their lives to bring back the power crystals.<br/><br/>Obviously, this has a sciffy color palette, but the principle is the same: small groups of diverse individuals leave civilization, invade not-civilization, risk their lives, and come back to glory/fame/women/hot meal on the table.  There's a reason they risk so much (they have to in order to survive), there's a thing they're after (power crystals), and they have to do it regularly (otherwise the domes will fail).<br/><br/>This is also obviously way simple, and no doubt there can be a ton of different incentives that work in concert.  That's what I'm looking for -- what incentives, what elements of the dungeon's context, makes dungeon-delving not the one-off thing done by guys who are otherwise out to save the world (Moria, anyone?), but the thing that guys do because that's what they do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132741/#Comment_132741" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T14:38:47+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  2:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh,<br/><br/>Things like picks/rope/swords/small goods/material goods are dirt cheap. Metal and twine and dry foodstuffs cost basically nothing.<br/><br/>In such a turbulent world, homes need to be well built, well situated and well protected. This, coupled with the expensive building procedures of the times, makes homes super expensive. We're talking millions of GP here.<br/><br/>Okay, now this: magic is in great abundance. We can see that in the world. So magical goods (disposable or permanent) are dirt cheap as well. We're in the mage glut right now. Swords are cheap, magic is cheap... magic swords are a bit pricier due to their synergistic nature, but they're still relatively cheap.<br/><br/>Homes, on the other hand, cost an absurd amount. And a home is too big to magically create. There are about six mages in the world who can just pop a house out of nowhere, and they charge more than plain old building it yourself. You can have mages materialize the components of a home, but it'll still cost quite a bit for those expensive building procedures.<br/><br/>When you go dungeon crawling, about 8% of that treasure will go into future dungeon crawls, typically. There will be the occasional time when you invest 70% of a crawl into full plate and a twin fire-orb double-helix broadsword, but... those are investments.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you get 4,500 gold pieces from a dungeon... That's enough to build a small hovel in the middle of nowhere. But it's not enough to build a home that'll survive weathering, wear and tear, mana storms, goblin raids and enemy invasions. It won't be a permanent solution.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you can put 300 gold pieces into adventuring gear and bank the rest. Only a madman would invest 4,500 in a dungeon at your skill level. Most of the money you earn is saved for your future home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132742/#Comment_132742" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T14:39:32+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  2:39PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about this, Josh?<br/><br/>Say you have a world with lots (and I mean crazy lots) of cave systems, inhabited by monsters. Now, people need all the stuff that you find in the ground: iron, copper, coal, gold, silver, and so on. But you can't just dig down there for it, because your miners will likely hit a cave and get eaten.<br/><br/>In this world, adventurers are required to go clear out caves so that people can dig out the stuff they need. <br/><br/>Big places (city states, powerful nobles) would probably have regular teams for this. Smaller places, not so much. So they would contract in people to do this job whenever they need it (i.e. find a new cave nearby), creating a profession of wandering cave-clearers. The big places might even want to pull in extra people for particular problems too.<br/><br/>The rewards are going to be smaller (i.e. a certain amount for doing the job from the employer, plus whatever you can loot off the monsters).<br/><br/>Plus, there's always the issue of some of these monsters coming up to the surface and directly threatening people, which might be too much for a village's militia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132745/#Comment_132745" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T14:51:27+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  2:51PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite>So -- there's a setting that accomodates dungeon celebrities.

I'm not sure it'd be worth the effort, but then, I guess I don't really know where you're going with this.<br/><br/>So there's a question:  what is it that you actually want a system for?  A measure of how well-known and -liked the characters are?  A big social stick that the rich and famous can use to beat their lessers with?  A system for delivering bigger and better ego-strokes as the characters grow more powerful?  A resource pool that delivers kingdoms and favors from gods to verified celebrities?  A cap on character power that means only the most famous dragonslayer in all the land can wield the +5 Holy Longsword of Punking Dragons?<br/><br/>Because if all you really want is a rationale for why all the teens are joining garage adventuring bands and trying to hit the big time, I think you can get there by simply saying that adventuring makes you famous, and -- just as in the real world -- there will always be people who want to be more famous, no matter what it takes.  If it makes you happy to think that 95% of adventurers are rational enough to say, "Okay, I've got a big enough pile of gold to live like a Baronet for the rest of my life, I'm hangin' up the battleaxe now," that's fine; they're like the musicians who played the local clubs, maybe put out an album, but decided that in the end they'd rather have health insurance and a regular paycheck than keep struggling.  There's plenty of room for those people, because there'll still be the last 5% who are crazy or obsessive enough to keep going forever, even after they ascend to demigodhood and can create entire planes of existence; that's what makes them superstars.  It ain't like the Rolling Stones have anything they need to prove to anyone at this point, but they'll still drag their wrinkled asses out on a grueling 20-city megatour, because that's what they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132746/#Comment_132746" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T14:55:19+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  2:55PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alpha-6 sounds cool to me.

I like Kynn's take on things, even as I can see how it doesn't fit the spirit of this thread. It kind of makes me think of "Ender's Game"!<br/><br/>It can be taken in the direction of other fantasy tropes as well. For instance, why are there people dedicated to fighting hordes of monsters? Maybe there's a Hole to Hell/Interdimensional Rift/Dark Lord that Spawns Monsters Constantly, or some other dark place from which monsters are just constantly emerging and must be fought off. Maybe there's some sort of dimensional rift thing, and the only magic that exists can only send individuals through, not armies. So, highly trained "heroes" are needed to fight the menace, maybe in groups of four...<br/><br/>2. What was wrong with the suggestion about the Swords &amp; Sorcery angle? Taking it more generally: dungeons, for some reason (history, metaphysics, whatever), contain some highly valuable substance.<br/><br/>Option A: An older civilization has collapsed. For some reason, all their coinage ended up in tombs, caves, or dungeons. Their coinage is much, much more valuable that what is in circulation now. Everyone knows about this--it's basic history. "Adventurers" go into those dangerous places and try to retrieve some of it, knowing it will make them rich if they can get their hands on it. <br/><br/>Option B: The Island Continent of ABC is the only place where there is still ore to be mined, or gold, or whatever (maybe even just fresh water?). Many, many mines were dug until, one day, the broke through into the territory of some weird underground race. There was a big fight, and the underground creatures killed all the miners. Now, people must be sent to reclaim the mines.<br/><br/>3. Dungeon-delving is extremely fashionable! Why? Because the current Queen just gets off on dungeoneering heroes. Every year, she organizes a great Tournament, where teams of adventurers from around the country gather to undertake some new challenge. The winners get richly rewarded. However, now all the other nobles want to be cool, too. They organize their own, lower-stakes Tourneys, which draw bigger crowds. Conceivably, in this setting dungenoneers wouldn't be disgruntled farmers but spoiled young kids--from royal families, etc, who have nothing better to do with their lives until the parents croak.<br/><br/>4. I've always been fascinated by the idea of a D&amp;D world whose inhabitants were aware of the mechanics of the game, or, at least, their effects.<br/><br/>"Hey, Joe! Remember that guy who killed those goblins and suddenly felt himself growing stronger, healthier, and just saying he felt better? Well, I fought a wyvern with some soldiers last week. After we killed it (and we were lucky, believe me--you should've seen the size of the thing), I just felt this tingling in all my limbs, like I was experiencing life on a new level. Ever since then, nothing seems to... well, *hurt* as much. Here, take this frying pan and hit me on the head with it! [clang!] See? Not even a bruise! Cool, huh? [A few later...] Man, the high I got from killing that wyvern was just soooo... I can't even describe it. I've got to get that feeling again!"<br/><br/>Maybe monsters or dungeons have some mystical essence (something known and understood by metaphysicists), the effects of which are mind-blowingly beneficial to humans. The game system calls it "XP", but what do the King's top metaphysicists call it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132752/#Comment_132752" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T15:21:15+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  3:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you've never been appreciated, appreciation is the only goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132754/#Comment_132754" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T15:28:51+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  3:28PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see that the pursuit of fame and making sense have anything at all to do with each other, really.  Why would someone want fame?  Hell if I know, but it seems clear that some people just <i>do</i>.  I mean, Paris Hilton already had the money and all the other perks more or less from the day she was born, but if there's anything you can say about her that would be printable in a family newspaper, it's that she wants fame and will stop at nothing to get it; even infamy is more desirable to her than anonymity.  Attention is its own reward for some people, I guess.<br/><br/>Plus, in a competitive enough market, yesterday's fame is worth a fraction of today's -- ten years ago you might have been Korgax Gorebringer, Reaver of the Abyss and Dominator of the Barren Lands, but now you're just that grumpy dwarf who used to be famous...the new hotness is that Lyra Brightsword chick, 'cause she wears a mithril chainmail bikini and put Orcus's head on a pike.

Who are the kids going to pretend to be when they hit each other with sticks in the front yard?  Whose name is going to be on everyone's lips from here to the Mountain of the Winds?  Now, if Korgax is cool with retiring quietly into obscurity, that's fine for him...but a Korgax who genuinely wants fame isn't going to sit in his luxurious palace for ten years just because he can afford it; he'll add "Conqueror of the Molten Lands" and "Slayer of Yeogheduhuy" and "God-King of the Slime People" to his list of accomplishments for no other reason than because he <i>can</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132756/#Comment_132756" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T15:48:28+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  3:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another specific scenario.  I don't know if this is what you're talking about, Josh, but this is inspired by the Ice Road Truckers documentary that was playing a few months back.<br/><br/>Pick a Thing that's valuable to the world.  I don't care what it is -- diamonds, manarocks, whatever.  This thing is a valuable commodity, enough to drive sectors of the economy towards supporting the mining/gathering/harvesting of this commodity and create an infrastructure behind that.<br/><br/>Problem: the richest vein of this isn't on our continent, but far, far away, only reachable by airship.  And even then, the winds are fierce.  Economically, this is barely viable as an option.<br/><br/>However:  there are caves near the northern shore of this continent.  Most times in the year, these are simply caves that hold owlbears and the occasional lost goblin.  But, during one month out of the year, a spiritual bridge forms within these caves that links them to caves on that far-off continent.  With that, transporting equipment to the mining settlement and transporting material back is an easy task.  At least, if it wasn't for all those damned fiends and monsters that float in from other planes, attracted to the spirit-bridge.  Groups of adventurers come up for the chance to earn a fortune, escorting merchants and laborers across the spirit-bridge.<br/><br/>And Furthermore:  Of course, over the years there's been quite the market for adventuring goods that has built up around those caves.  If you lose your sword to a rust monster, don't worry -- you can buy a new one at the settlement.  Of course, it's a good three times more expensive, but you've been making good money lately.  Don't want to buy it?  Well, your license tells me you can't escort without a sword, since that's what you qualified with...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132758/#Comment_132758" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T15:59:40+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  3:59PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fame could also be what you don't want.

One pouch of gold coins may be three months of livelihood for some people but for others it may be a year's worth of pay. Or enough money to move them to entire different social class. (or woo the princess, or get Timmy the operation)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not personally wealthy, so would I risk my life for 3 months livelihood? If I was starving to death or my son needed an operation, absolutely. Would I risk my life for a year's worth of pay? Or if it meant moving from working class poor to comfortable middle class? Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do people go back? Well, why do thieves go back again and again? <br/>\n1- It's where the money is.<br/>\n2- It's *addictive*. Can you really go back to shoveling crap for a living after you've tasted wealth and comfort?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why people take dangerous jobs in real life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132834/#Comment_132834" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T22:14:27+00:00" title="March  5, 2008 10:14PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2008 10:14PM by Simon_C.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things we know about orcs:<br/><br/>They hate and fear sunlight<br/>They attack and kill humans on sight<br/>They are utterly without remorse or fear<br/>They live in deep holes<br/>They know where we live<br/><br/>Things we know about the world:<br/><br/>There are deep caves and dungeons everywhere<br/>We live close to them<br/>Every night the orcs come out<br/>They can't reach the village before daybreak<br/><br/>An eclipse is coming<br/><br/>It's the "Pitch Black" version of dungeon delving.

All we know is that they get paid a lot of money to keep society from crumbling under the strain of these nonhuman robbers and hostage takers.<br/><br/>Some think we should just kill the orcs and goblins and wyrms and ogres.

The rarer they are, the less you really need a general / rational / ground socio-economic reason.<br/><br/><br/>On another track, the adventuring-rationale might be convoluted, multiple and/or counterintuitive. To take example from our world:\n<ul>\n<li>Why do people murder their neighbors in Kenya \u201cEthnic violence\u201d? (Immoral, risky, no gain, they\u2019ll soon get vengeance at your door or international \u201cjustice\u201d, \u2026)</li>\n<li>Why do some people eat so badly (junk food, obesity, unhealthy additives)?</li>\n<li>Why do people deal drugs (dangerous, they get caught, killed, \u2026 not so many are \u201csuccessful\u201d)?</li>\n</ul>\nThere might be no simple, rational answer to \u201cWhy adenturers?\u201d. And probably not an entirely economic one.<br/><br/>And I think the reasons for any activity lie as much (if not more) in the individual than in the society. The more marginal the activity, the more individual the reasons.<br/><br/>Now, if adventurers are common and adventures are economically sounds, giving enough earnings to justify the risks, how does society/economy cope with this?<br/><br/>A question I find interesting: what if adventures / dungeon crawling is new? It only became possible / trendy. Like the gold that suddenly came to Europe from the Americas in the XVIIth century? What happens? (Alternatively, what if it is a declining/disappearing activity?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132894/#Comment_132894" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T07:08:27+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  7:08AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its all about trophies.

Now there's just ruins and tombs left from the old order.  Civilization has regressed.  You have a wealthy few who are trying to carve their own kingdoms out of the rubble and perhaps even reinvent the old empire.  There are ancient artifacts and tomes buried in the ruins of these places.  The new rulers want them but they sure as hell aren't willing to risk their lives to brave the ruins to get them.  Who knows what the ancients left around to guard their stuff.  Maybe the ones who destroyed the ancients are still around lurking in the dark.  Their thinking is to hire some professionals to go dungeon delving for them.  Sometimes the dungeon delvers go without being asked and sell their finds afterwards.

I'll list what I think the criteria are, and Josh can correct me if I'm wrong. When posting, consider whether or not your idea meets each of these criteria:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Good Incentive - There has to be a strong incentive to go, good enough to overcome the risk of death. Frankly all of the things mentioned can be the incentives (fame, money, sex, annonymity, etc, etc, etc). The model just has to make the incentive strong enough that we'll believe that people will risk death for it repeatedly. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Not Too Good an Incentive - if the incentive is enough wealth that you can retire, or will be famous forever, or get the woman of your dreams, etc, then why would you go back and do it again? Somehow the incentive is not great enough to retire once you get it. Lots of people are proposing ideas for incentives that, if achieved, would lead the character to never feel the need to go again. Addicted to it? After just once? Sure, I understand the halcyon feeling of ozone in the air where you get nostalgic for the "good old days" and sitting on your rear seems a terrible fate... it's just not as bad as death. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Small Bands - for some reason, despite the high level of incentive, we don't send armies, we send small groups of people. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I have here is that these seem to be mutually exclusive. Basically there's a cost-benefit analysis. According to the show "Deadliest Catch" this job, considered phenomenally dangerous, results in .3% (300 per 100,000) fatalities each year. This is the level of danger that results in a higher rate of pay... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you estimate as your chances of surviving as a team of folks going into a place with lots of deadly creatures? Where you don't know what you'll encounter, but it's sure to be something monsterous in terms of size, natural weaponry, or it might even be intelligent, and weilding weapons? I think that the natural tendency is to just think 50%. In fact, if the dungeon is balanced, shouldn't it be around there? <br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, let's say that somehow we're experts in this area (how one gets to be, I don't know), and well prepared... call it only 25% chance of dying. That's two orders of magnitude larger a chance to die. Hell, let's say that the guy is really confident in his own abilities and is using only a 10% chance of death. The crab fisherman, intending on fishing for only ten seasons before retiring has better than a 97% chance of surviving to this retirement. The adventurer going on ten adventures has only a 35% chance of making it all the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, sure, each success means that the next one is still at 90%. But tell me one activity that people do that results in 10% death rate, outside of being in an army and fighting a battle? In which case the incentive is (even abstractly or putatively, we all know that there are lots of exceptions in history) survival. Because you can't expect to enjoy your riches if you don't live to do so. This is a level of danger at which the only way that I can see people accepting the risk is if it means that the rewards will satisfy most of their dreams in one shot. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the example that Josh gives actually works in terms of it being survival, but then it's not going to be left to "adventurers." Instead the job of retrieving these valuable will be an honored profession. And they'll send as many people as possible to get these things, because it means a higher rate of success, and a lower rate of death. Yes, you're risking more lives, but the fact is that, tactically, there's relative safety in numbers. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if we also posit some reason why large numbers are problematic, then,,,<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, it's basically Earthdawn, but during the time underground when the horrors ruled the world. But, in this version, the Kaers are running down, and there's no sign that the horrors are retreating. Somebody has to go outside to get the resources needed to do upkeep on the Kaers. But the horrors, in this version, can detect any group larger than ten or so. For safety's sake, as the number is not 100% clear, no group larger than 6 is allowed outside together. The intrepid individuals who volunteer for these services are called Salvagers...<br/>\n<br/>\nClose? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132992/#Comment_132992" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T13:53:35+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  1:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A little OT, but Remi's idea \n<blockquote>I like the idea that dungeon adventurers are genocidal adrenaline junkies feeding off the paranoia and racism of the towns they 'save' from the 'goblin menace'.

See, thing is, I've got a family too, and I've a job to do.  So, here's what's gonna happen.  I'm going to eat this sandwich you made me (what is this?  Owlbear!  Incredible.

First level dungeon gets you to 3rd level, maybe?  A coupla hit dice, and the loot pays for kit "commensurate to status."  Because really, what kind of fighter goes out at 3rd level with the same gear he started out with?  Light chain and a longsword, pshah.  That'll chew up the gold until 6th-7th level, and then you start to actually see the amazing returns that the whole adventuring thing promised: the nice house, a manservant, maybe some tenants.  Or, if you're a wizard, a cozy tower on the outskirts of a superstitious village, full of clients and test subjects.  But then, then they've got you.  Just like Philip Morris execs are working to pay their mortgage, mid-level adventurers cannot possibly manage their new wealth in any kind of reasonable way.  Culture's totally against it, innit?  You can't invest.  Either you go out and beat taxes out of peasants who (if you'll recall) can feed their whole family on a gold piece for a week, so that's hardly going to cover wages and spell components, or you go back into a hole, beat up on the local trolls and pull down the real income.  And, as long as that's how capitol is got, no one is ever goign to have time to sit down and invent usury, much less corporatism, stock markets, or other more reliable, less dangerous ways of making mad cash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133038/#Comment_133038" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T15:57:35+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  3:57PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, what about pirates?

I'll give you a hint: California in 1849.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor many years, the sages and wizards have endeavored to find the formula of the Elixir of Invulnerability.  Legend has it that a pint of this drink cured some legendary hero of the plague, and gave him the strength of 100 men so he could slay the Dark Tyrant's forces barehanded and save the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, an alchemist in the player characters' home town has discovered the crucial ingredient for the Elixir: an ancient, slimy moss that grows on the stones of damp subterranean floors.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe one of the PCs was a servant in the alchemist's house who overheard the conversation when the alchemist's brother came to visit.  Maybe another PC works for a rival alchemist.  Whatever the case, the PCs are some of the only people who know that "cave mold" has just become the most valuable thing ever...but once word of the discovery gets out, every cave, crypt, mine and hole in the ground is going to be overrun with crazed prospectors turning over every stone...unless the PCs get there first.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Mold Rush game, the Elixir of Invulnerability is both a cure-all and a military weapon, so unlimited quantities of it will be in demand.  The mold takes decades to mature, so you can't just grow a patch in your basement, and naturally, bigger, deeper, more remote dungeons are likely to have more of the stuff.  The need for the PCs to act quickly puts some dramatic tension on the table, and leaves open the possibility of a secret weapon if they can formulate some of the Elixir for themselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to keep the action focused on bloodshed, then perhaps the Elixir needs another ingredient like pickled orc hearts or something.  This would also prevent the dungeon delvers from trying to sidestep some of the traditional D&amp;D violence ("Good day, Mrs. Kobold! Have you heard about our revolutionary new Dungeon Floor-Cleaning System?  How would you like a free trial today?") by negotiating with the dungeon inhabitants.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the sessions are played, the PCs hear rumors of other adventuring parties heading out, and then there's news that the local lord has announced the building of a new 'brewery'.  The latest dungeon was full of dead gnolls and a couple peasants in ragtag armor, and the floors had been scraped clean.  And now the PCs seem to have assassins following them....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133091/#Comment_133091" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T21:04:42+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  9:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reminds of a guy from Ancient Greece. Forget who he was but he defended Athens from an attack and became famous. With that fame he went before the city and said "Give me 5 ships full of soldiers and I'll bring bank enough gold for everyone.". So he took the soldiers to another Greek city where someone had pissed him off and attempted to sack it, kill the men , and sell the women and children into slavery or something like. But that city found out he was coming coming and prepared defenses. He lost was taken back to Athens. The Athenians convicted him of fraud.<br/><br/>Not murder, not theft, not anything to do with planning to kill a lot of people and getting a lot of Athenian soldiers killed but fraud because he did not bring back enough gold for everyone.<br/><br/>That is the kind of mindset that makes adventuring possible. Add in the idea of the Hero chosen by the Gods who will do great things ensures that the adventuring party forms. Or the only death that can earn you anything besides being a formless shade in Hades is to be the one that is fmaous enough to have stories told about you for generations to come.<br/>Plus there really isn't that much money in it. Lost of magic swords and other things to help kill stuff but not much that is useful back home. So you need to keep going out again and again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133132/#Comment_133132" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T01:19:33+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  1:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite>And then Jordan and Ajax -- there are all sorts of non-rational, immoral, ill-advised reasons that people do risky things.  Here's the flip, though: I'm not really seeing dungeon-delvers portrayed as non-rational, immoral, and ill-advised.  I see them being portrayed as heroes.</blockquote>\nThe immorality is, I believe, in our reference frame, not in the character\u2019s. To take an extreme example: Nazis were, at a time, German heroes (and for some people, still are\u2026).<br/><br/>In most worlds, dungeon-plunderers <i>are</i> perceived as brave, which is somehow in opposition with rational, and killing the creatures they defeat is not immoral. After all, in our world, killing savages, foreigners, barbarians (think native americans, africans, moors, jews, and, to cite the crusades\u2019 targets \u201cMuslims, pagan Slavs, Russian and Greek Orthodox Christians, Mongols, Cathars, Hussites, and political enemies of the popes\u201d \u2026)\u2014 or just your neighbor \u2014 wasn't immoral (and for some still isn't). And the targets were (are) human! (Of course sometimes they were \u201cnot really as human as us\u201d.) So, those <i>creatures</i>\u2026 Ideology / beliefs / values / reference frame are sufficient to justify adventurer. And dungeon-invading/plundering isn't reprehensible (except maybe for private hunting grounds).<br/><br/>That is not to say that the economic frame isn't important. I just believe that it is a part of the values-reference-frame. Of course, in our society, monetary value quickly influences moral value \u2014 oil war, anyone? \u2014 but I am enough of an idealist to believe that it is (/was/will be) not like that everywhen. I believe that the lucre aspect is incredibly more important to us than it is to the pictured civilisations.<br/><br/>However, the more common are adventurers, the more important the socio-economic frame is. How does the society cope with adventurers needs and returns (here we go economico-capitalist again).<br/><br/>The main problem I see with common / institutional dungeon-is that you\u2019ll soon run out of dungeons. Usually, once you have cleaned a dungeon, monsters and treasures do not re-spawn. So, a civilisation can only rely on dungeon plundering for a relatively short time.<br/><br/>There are ways to solve this problem: plundering expeditions far away (maybe raids in other cultures dungeonning grounds?), nomadic culture, gateways through which an endless supply of equipped monsters flow through or through which adventurers go plundering (Stargate-like?), fluctuating/instable reality, \u2026<br/><br/>I don\u2019t think dungeon-delving can become common <i>and</i> stay as dangerous. For it to become commoner, the risks/reward ratio is to be lowered. The dungeons might be less dangerous, or the crawling organized to lower the risk: more people, trained and well equipped. Or the rewards might be much, much higher. Rewards aren\u2019t necessarily monetary: adventurers (or their backers) save their lives/world for a time; or may get a spiritual reward (maybe a dungeon-crawl is a mandatory pilgrimage?), like getting objectively nearer their paradise.<br/><br/>However, common dungeon-plundering leads away from conventional fantasy and even farther from the \u201ca few friends form an independent group\u201d clich\xe9. (Which isn\u2019t bad per se.)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite>It is human nature to not being satisfied when reaching his goal. How many Rock Stars have stopped performing when reaching their "goal" amount of fame, women or money? How many business men stop doing their stuff once they reach their first million? And their second? And after their fifth Beach house? And is there any priest who would stop preaching once he has converted a certain amounth of workshipers?</blockquote>\nWell, they\u2019re not so numerous, and they\u2019re not dangerously risking their live each time they play / conclude a contract / try to convert someone. Policemen, firemen and soldiers might be closer analogies. Few of them are in independents small groups. Maybe mercenaries and small-scale criminals better fit the bill, but we unfortunately get back to the immoral / reprehensible problem.<br/><br/>To conclude, I believe that the moral problem and the need economic-justification come entirely from our own (capitalist, consumerist, globalized, environmental-minded and fellow-beings-empathic) culture / reference frame and have no signification \u2014 or, rather, totally different significations \u2014 in a more medieval / antique / barbarian / savage one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133181/#Comment_133181" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T07:56:44+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  7:56AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>Well, they\u2019re not so numerous, and they\u2019re not dangerously risking their live each time they play / conclude a contract / try to convert someone.

My point was just to point out that expecting people to stop doing what they know how to do (and possibly like doing), just because they "reached their pre-defined goal" is unrealistic and uncommon.<br/><br/>But, then again, we found another motivation in here: wish to do good. They want to make the world a better place, no matter their personal cost. They risk their integrity, and even their lives, to protect and save people. Once again, a "self-defense" against the unknown threat would be a close and "morally and socially" acceptable term. And economically viable. People is willing to pay just to make sure there is someone taking care of criminals (or at least trying), and turning off fires, and stuff.<br/><br/>Except policemen in Mexico.

You're taking that one point out of context. It's presented as a criteria for the ultra-dangerous occupation of dungeoneering. In that limited case, it's a criteria. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean.. as a retired soldier, and the son of a retired soldier, no amount of money would make me want to go to Iraq. I have children, and I'm not going to try to get rich at the risk of them losing their father. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I've been thinking of going back into the military soley on moral grounds. The men who are there fighting right now believe that they have a duty to do what they're doing... they're not trying to get rich (getting rich as a soldier is a ludicrous idea). And this is about the most dangerous sort of job that exists in real life. I believe that police and firefighters do what they do mostly on moral grounds as well... that, and it's really comparably not all that lethal. One can expect reasonably to make it to retirement. Even soldiers do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can't reasonably expect to make it to retirement, then, again, again, again, you aren't going to go for the gold. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, put a moral reason to risk your life, and people will do it. If it's the holy grail we're after, then, sure, that'll work. And we'll keep on looking for it, even if it means risking your life. Immortality serums work, too. After all, once you've become immortal, you've more than made up for the risks you took. You're only risking the length of the remainder of your life, after all. But if/when you get the grail, or the immortality serum? Then you retire. Immortality serum needs refreshing? Then armies are going to be created to make sure a constant supply is maintained. In fact this will become the most all-important thing in the universe to everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee Dune. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I don't see which incentives would. That was all I was saying. And I'm not comparing them to moral motivations (such as your "soldier" example). All I am saying is that most of the times whatever incentive it was that drove them to it would not make them "to never feel the need" again.

I'd tell ya, but my mug's almost empt--there, that's better.<br/><br/>"Everyone knows about Monsters. The Gods fucked up, or they were drunk at the time, or they work in mysterious ways or whatever. When they were done making the World and the People who live in her, they couldn't just leave well enough alone; they had to go and make Monsters too. You don't need <i>me</i> to tell you what right bastards Monsters are. They eat your livestock, raid your villages, demand your virgin daughters as tribute, all that crap. What's worse is they squat in <i>our</i> ruins, hoarding <i>our</i> gold and magical goodies. Like they have the right. Like they <i>own</i> our stuff just because they kill anyone who tries to take it back from them. <br/><br/>"I tell ya, it just ain't right. Who do they think they are, <i>People?</i><br/><br/>"So yeah, Monsters are like the weather: everyone complains about them but no one ever <i>does</i> anything about them. I mean, sure, when they get <i>really</i> out of hand, when they threaten the cities or the important trade routes or whatever, some Baron or another will raise an army and drive the bastards out. Trouble is, they never <i>finish the job.</i> As soon as <i>their</i> estates are safe and their buddies in the merchants guilds stop complaining, they think the problem's solved. So they lose a couple outlying villages; it's no skin off of <i>their</i> powdered noses.<br/><br/>"Course, I can't say I blame them. I mean, think about it, it takes <i>time</i> to train an army. You get your military wiped out hunting down a fire giant or something and you think all your scheming, land-hungry neighboring Barons are just going to <i>overlook</i> that little detail? Hardly. You're better off keeping your armies home so everyone can see how well-defended you are and if Monsters <i>do</i> show up, just <i>throw some money</i> at the problem.<br/><br/>"That's where I come in.<br/><br/>"See, most People are content to lead quiet, simple lives. They tend their crops and they nurture their families. They cherish their young and they mourn their dead. Sometimes they fall in love. Sometimes they go to war.<br/><br/>"But some folks just aren't like that. We're not any <i>good</i> at quiet and simple. We want more. Some of us want gold. Some of us want fame. Some of us get the fool notion in our heads that all is not right with the World and <i>we can make it better.</i> Everyone's got their own reasons and -- here's the secret -- <i>the reasons don't matter.</i> All that matters is that we want more, and the thing about "more" is, no matter how much you get, you can't ever <i>have</i> it. If you know what I mean.<br/><br/>"So anyway, yeah, there's one in every town. That kid who just doesn't seem to fit in. He's the daydreamer, or the kid who's mad all the time for no reason, or the one you can just tell thinks she belongs <i>somewhere else</i>, you know? So this kid grows up a little, learns a couple of spells or gets ahold of a sword and figures out a couple of moves. And then one day, they're just <i>gone.</i> And everyone wonders what happened to them, but no one wonders <i>too</i> much, you know?<br/><br/>"Chances are, the poor kid won't make it. Hells, they probably won't even live long enough to <i>see</i> a Monster. Bandits get the, or wolves, or, I dunno, they fall down a ravine and break their necks or whatever. The ones that <i>do</i> make it to a dungeon probably won't make it out. If it was easy, everyone would do it.<br/><br/>"But we're talking about a lot of kids from a lot of villages. <i>Some</i> of them are gonna make it out alive. It's just -- what's that word -- sta<i>tis</i>tics. So there you are: you've got some blood on your blade and a nice sized sack of gold and <i>now</i> what do you do? Go home, buy everyone a round of drinks, brag about your exploits and invest your money in textiles? You <i>could</i> do that, I guess, if you want to spend the rest of your days reminiscing about that one afternoon you felt <i>really alive.</i> Course, if that was enough to satisfy you, you'd have never left home in the first place.<br/><br/>"No, once it gets in your blood you never go back. It's on to the next dungeon, and the one after that, and the one after that. And then one day, maybe on purpose, maybe just through dumb luck, one of your adventures actually ends up <i>helping</i> someone. You kick open the door to the goblin chieftain's treasure chamber and there's the <i>mayor's daughter</i> or whoever, tied up in the corner. Now you're not just an adventurer anymore, you're a bloody <i>hero.</i> <br/><br/>"And at that point, my friend, you're well and truly fucked.<br/><br/>"Once you get mixed up in the hero business, it's damned hard to get out. Maybe you've got a soft spot for the helpless, maybe you just like the attention, doesn't really matter. For whatever reason, you're not just doing it for yourself anymore, you're doing it because people <i>need</i> you.<br/><br/>"Tidying up after careless Gods is a dangerous business. It can be a thankless and lonely one as well. Once you\u2019ve helped a few people, you learn not to overstay your welcome. Sure, they\u2019ll rejoice when you kill the giant who demands their children in tribute, the warlord who taxes them into starvation, the necromancer who makes slaves of their dead. They\u2019ll shower you with praise, throw you parades, erect statues in your honor, sometimes even pay you. One or two of them might end up in your bed.<br/><br/>"But stick around after the party winds down and you\u2019ll see just how fast gratitude turns to resentment. As long as you remain among them, you\u2019re a living reminder of how powerless they really are, of how dangerous their world really is. Give them long enough to think about it and they\u2019ll hate you for it.<br/><br/>"So you learn to keep moving. Go in, do the job, collect the spoils, and get out. You start hanging out with other adventurers, form a little party. Safety in numbers, yeah, but more important, they <i>get</i> you. Most folks look at you, all they see is your job. They see a name out of a ballad. They see how you can help them, how you can hurt them, how you're different from them, but they don't see <i>you</i>. Your party members, though, they <i>know who you are</i>. Doesn't mean they <i>like</i> you -- Gods only know I've had a lot more comrades than I have friends -- but it sure counts for <i>something.</i><br/><br/>"So you wanna know why I keep doing it? Is it the money? The fame? The satisfaction of doing the right thing? Bah. Some of that's nice, some of it's just a pain in the ass. The real reason is that it's all I <i>can</i> do. I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I chose this life, but now that I did, this life just won't <i>let</i> me do anything else.<br/><br/>I'll be moving on now.

In some ways, it may be more "historically realistic" (say it three times, without laughing). WARNING: Do not consume with D&amp;D.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Sure, there's all those adventurers running around and going and fighting monsters and stuff. They come home, they tell great stories about their adventures, sometimes they bring back something bloody in a sack. Occasionally, they bring back some gold or treasures (actually, they do that more often than the bloody sacks, oddly enough).<br/><br/>But they aren't "professionals", in the modern sense of the world. Rather, they're more like a cross between minstrels or traveling performers and those bloodthirsty knights who tend to hang around a King's table. They're not doing it to make money. They don't know anything about eco... ecol... econo... you know, saving coins and stuff.<br/><br/>Yeah, they go out and hunt for adventure. But the vast majority of the time, they don't find it, which is why they're still alive. Nevertheless, when they come back to town, hungry and tired, there's that other guy who also just came back, and he's telling a story about how he scared away an ogre from a nearby farm during the night. And, at the other inn, someone's actually got a tooth from a dragon to show, or a hoof from some sort of centaur or something. What are they gonna do?<br/><br/>See, that's the deal. All these people come back, and tell stories about their great adventures. The public, they're living tough, toilsome lives, or boring lives in their castle, where someone else does everything for them. They love these stories! Plus, they feel safer knowing these menaces are being defeated. They haven't gone to school and learned about burden of proof and the scientific method. They _want_ to believe these stories. They don't have TV--they don't know that the outside world isn't really like that!<br/><br/>So, that's how it goes. Do some of these adventurers actually encounter a monster sometimes, or come across some brigands? Maybe. Who knows? Most of them just know they've got to come up with a better story than the guys who just got to the town before them. Or maybe they want to impress the King--don't want to be the knight who fell out of his Majesty's favour. <br/><br/>Either way, they bow down or get up on a table or whatever, and make up the most exciting yarn they can come up with. Better hope there isn't anyone there who can prove you wrong--but chances of that are pretty slim, and even then it's their word against yours, and your story's probably more interesting.<br/><br/>Maybe they fought some bandits, or maybe they beat up a merchant or some farmer's son. You think they're going to admit that's where their bag of gold came from? On the other hand, finding an old skull in the forest, or sawing the hoof off a dead deer can really lend credibility to your story, so pick it up and bring it back with you.<br/><br/>Adventurers? They're _entertainers_, really. Some go from town to town telling their stories or spreading rumours about threats in the forest. People at the tavern throw coins at them and buy them drinks and dinner; the innkeeper lets them stay for free. After a couple of days, they're smart enough to know they need to move on.<br/><br/>Others aim higher, going straight to the King's court. The King might reward them handsomely for what they supposedly did--ridding the kingdom of some witch is always good news, and the king who rewards them knows he will look really good in the eyes of his subjects. If a king or noble really likes their stories, he might act as a patron to them, paying them a salary in return for the wild accounts they return to tell every few days or every few weeks. (That's how they get the supplies and the henchmen and what not. Better be gone quick, though, if he ever finds out they were making that shit up!)<br/><br/>Remember, to get the accolades, you've got to top the other stories being told. With enough of this going around, accounts are going to get REALLY out of hand--wild magic, beasts, monsters, traps, ahoy!<br/><br/>Now, some might be geniune heroes, just with a knack for exagerration. But how much adventure can there be out there? The others are veritable con men. Still others might be grave robbers or break into ancient tombs to steal stuff. But this one group, maybe the one you're part of, might one day run into a real monster and a real adventure... what will you do now? Whoever's the current "hero" might not take well to having attention drawn away from them. Even if you survive the dungeon, when you get back to town you might have to face a bunch of toughs in the back alley, asking you to leave town _or else_...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133596/#Comment_133596" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T13:47:39+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  1:47PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the motives I'm presenting in <b>Labyrinths &amp; Lycanthropes</b><br/><br/><b>Why are you off t\u2019dungeon?</b><br/>Each PC has a motive for joining the adventuring party and venturing into the dread labyrinths. <br/><br/><b>Vengeance </b>- you\u2019ve been greatly wronged an\u2019 it\u2019s slaying time!

Because you can't just die <i>anywhere</i> and expect to be whisked away by angels or something. That's rubbish.<br/><br/>No, the afterlife must be sought after. And where does the afterlife hide? In the deepest caverns of the world, closest to the fissures between this world and the next.<br/><br/>The developed races aren't the only ones who seek the afterlife. Sadly, they are the only ones who can access it. What this means is that goblins and ogres are constantly drawn to the scent of the afterlife, only to linger about the portals to the next plane in quiet suffering, unable to complete the journey they have labored over. Strangely, though, they can feed off of these portals... they become stronger and sometimes evolve underground, sucking power through the portal. Most adventurers rumor that if a cavern is littered with dangerous, unstable, powerful monsters, that it is most likely to contain an active portal to the afterlife.<br/><br/>So, why doesn't a group of adventurers reach the portal and set up a teleportation beacon so that others can join their great voyage? Well, most portals are temporal and instable, and will collapse after so many travelers. The average portal will transport five to ten travelers before it gives out. This is why adventuring parties rarely exist in numbers above about six - if they did, it would end in trials of bloodshed to see who reached the afterlife. Instead, they travel in groups that they can safely assume will all be able to make it across the threshold.<br/><br/>Except... a lot of the time when they get to the deepest reaches of a cavern system, all they find is a burnt out portal, and a lot of hungry monsters who are angry that they failed to halt the last group of adventurers who disturbed their portal-worshiping home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133675/#Comment_133675" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T06:51:24+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  6:51AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Ron should get credit for a rather compelling portrait of a character who you can believe would live the sort of life in question.

Much like the crusades -- there is not only the moral (or at least religious) call, but there is the economic benefits that make answering the moral call not simply throwing your life away.  Because there's always a few guys who will throw their lives away to answer the immediate moral call; if you're looking for something massive and with broad-based support (like the Crusades), you need an economic context parallel to that moral call.<br/><br/>X-Crawl looks like it completely supplants the moral basis with an economic basis.  It's intentionally crass, with the adventurers competing for a brand new car and whatnot.  That's not what I'm looking for (although it looks amusing).  I don't want to abandon the moral, idealistic, altruistic calling -- I just want it to be a sustainable thing, rather than a perpetually redefined one-off.  I get annoyed with the guy who is out to revenge himself on his father's murderer, and so is all for throwing his entire life into the effort, who finally kills the guy and then has to redefine his character motivations so that he can stay in the campaign (my father's murderer was only taking orders, and now I have to kill his superior...).  Alternately, if you're a paladin out to cleanse the world of evil orcs, at some point the loot you get can raise an army, and why aren't you torching dungeons with an army instead of your group of six compatriots?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133826/#Comment_133826" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T15:32:48+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  3:32PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a slight tangent to all of the above, but I've been working my way through The Wire (ending season 2 tonight) and I'm reminded of a thought that the dungeon-hauler is kind of analagous to the drug dealer.<br/><br/>(Of course, the risks are plainly not as great. A lot of people in the drug trade end up dead, but a lot more don't. Still, I think the analogy might go somewhere useful.)<br/><br/>Most people in the drug trade are living a risky life. They get a big payday, but not so big that they can retire on it (unless they're right in the upper echelons). What motivates them to keep taking the risks?<br/>* debt<br/>* avarice<br/>* lack of apparent options<br/>* subcultural expectation<br/>* desire for respect/fear<br/>* expectation that their own life will be short<br/><br/>I think, in a world where your much-mentioned pig farmer is constantly at risk of being killed by wandering monsters, and where there is no conventional road to riches and security, and where adventurers earn some kind of kudos and respect, it makes sense. Add in that killing monster counts as a social good, as opposed to drug dealing which has massive social costs, and you have something that, to my mind, makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>"World full of badness like this one, anyone can end up dead at any time.

You've had your eye on him for a while now, of course. These adventuring types are unpredicable; you can never be too careful. This guy's been at it for a while, fighting his way up the food chain of toadies and minions and henchmen to get to his father's murderer. Along the way he's picked up a lot of power: magical goodies, obscure fighting techniques, money, fame. <br/><br/>When he was busy looking for his father's killer, that was one thing. But now he's at loose ends, with a whole bunch of power and no immediate plans. And if there's one thing you know about, it's power. Power wants to be used. If he doesn't find something to do with it, someone else will find something to do with <i>him.</i><br/><br/>Now, he might not be an immediate threat to <i>you</i>. You've got armies and highly trained personal guards and a couple of pretty badass wizard and fighter buddies of your own. But he could still cause you quite a bit of trouble: for one thing, the peasants just <i>love</i> him. Here's this guy of low birth going out and <i>making</i> something of himself. That sets kind of a dangerous precedent, doesn't it? It's one thing if he's just a character in some heroic ballad, but this guy is <i>right there</i>, drinking in their taverns, talking to them, filling their heads with all sorts of nonsense about "standing up for yourself" and "doing the right thing" and all that crap.<br/><br/>No, this isn't the sort of fellow you want hanging around in your kingdom at all.<br/><br/>Now, what to do about it? You could have him killed, you guess. But that's risky; people would talk. Besides, you're a civilized monarch. You only have people killed when you're <i>sure</i> they're no use to you alive.<br/><br/>So what do you do? You give him a <i>job.</i> What was that delegate from Vale of Doom bitching about the other day? Undead? Dragons? Undead dragons? Whatever. Some kind of local trouble, nothing worth wasting your own men dealing with. Not when there's an unemployed adventurer around.<br/><br/>And the best part? You don't even have to <i>pay</i> him that much. None of these adventuring types know the <i>real</i> value of a gold piece. They get enough coin to pay for their ale and whores and flaming swords and they think they're doing all right. So you dangle a couple sacks of gold under his nose and -- and here's the important part -- feed him a load of crap about what a "powerful force for Good" and an "inspiration to the people" he is, and he'll be running off to the Vale of Doom faster than you can say "recurring NPC".\n<blockquote>Alternately, if you're a paladin out to cleanse the world of evil orcs, at some point the loot you get can raise an army, and why aren't you torching dungeons with an army instead of your group of six compatriots?</blockquote>\nOK, so you're the head of the paladin's Church. You're a decent enough guy, pious, kind, yadda yadda. But you're still a <i>major religious figure</i>, right? Which means you're a businessman, and business is messy.<br/><br/>Now here's this kid, this paladin, this upstanding, righteous little stick in the mud out to "cleanse the world of evil." And you like the kid, you really do. Heck, he reminds you a little bit of yourself, back when you were young, before you learned how the world works. <br/><br/>But the kid's a pain in the ass, always going on about "is this <i>right</i>" and "is that <i>God's will</i>" and all that. It was fine at first, when all he wanted to do was kill a couple orcs, donate some gold, and spend all night torturing himself over his impure thoughts about that sneaky little halfling chick he hangs out with. But now he's got some power and some ambition (perfectly <i>holy</i> ambition, of course) and he wants to use the army -- the <i>Church</i> army, for crying out loud! -- to "scour the earth with God's holy fire and rid the land of evil orcs" or some such nonsense.<br/><br/>Is the kid really <i>that</i> dense? Doesn't he know how much of the Church's revenue comes from selling commissions in its army? Some very important people have paid a lot of money to dump their younger sons in an army where they'll stay out of trouble, maybe learn some discipline, and specifically <i>not get killed by orcs.</i><br/><br/>So what to do with the kid? You gotta tread carefully with these Lawful Good types; they think they smell corruption in every corner. Business is messy, right? Well to a kid who sees the world only in black and white, which side do you think "messy" comes down on?<br/><br/>So you can't tell him what you want to tell him, which is, "No, you idiot, you <i>can't</i> have my freakin' army!" Instead, you tell him, "Look, God's <i>obviously</i> favored you way more than our average soldier. If I let you lead them into battle, they'd be slaughtered, and do you <i>really</i> want all those deaths on your head?" Or, "We have an obligation to inspire the common people. What's more inspirational, an army of a thousand against five thousand orcs, or <i>six guys</i> against five thousand orcs?" Or, as a last resort, "You're a formidable warrior, my son, but you're still young in your faith. It's <i>God's will</i> that you face this menace alone."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133830/#Comment_133830" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T15:46:30+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  3:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballistic Roby</cite>Ah, I think I spy a slight disconnect -- I'm not looking for an economic basis to<em>replace</em>the moral imperative; I'm looking for an economic basis to<em>parallel, support, and be supported by</em>the moral imperative.</blockquote>OH!

Alternately, if you're a paladin out to cleanse the world of evil orcs, at some point the loot you get can raise an army, and why aren't you torching dungeons with an army instead of your group of six compatriots?</blockquote>\nTo be realistic, people can change their motivation midgame... Or they can have more than one. Maybe you already avanged your father, but during your adventures you realized helping those in need was more fulfilling than blindly following your own hate. Or maybe you realized that cleansing the world of orcs would mean little, since there would then be goblins, or trolls, or gnolls, or whatever... So your aim is more in changing the world or finding some ultimate ancient relic that could actually help in a meaningful way a change in reality and/or the shape of the world.<br/><br/>I think that with a little twist and logic, almost any "moral" reason can get to be complemented with some economical ones.<br/><br/>I'll take Joe's idea as an example.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>...the afterlife must be sought after.

Does every peasant or aristocrat is willing to risk his life to reach it? How about time and effort? The town's blacksmith has more things in his grasp to ever contemplate training and getting ready for a travel that would ultimately mean his last travel (perhaps literally)...<br/><br/>Enter the Adventurers. They are the Pathfinders, the Gate Keepers. They search for the ways in, for the gate's location, they clean the caverns of those greedy monsters, they manage the safe passage of defenseless commoners... They are sponsored by nobles, peasants look up to them and facilitate their work (they could benefit form lower costs for safe passage themselves), guilds of Pathfinders gather and grow. If they find any loot, joy! That was a nice bonus that comes from the job. If things go badly, at least their own treasures will eventually return to civilized folks' hands.<br/><br/>Sure it is a dangerous job, but someone needs to do it. And that makes that someone somewhat of a hero, a leader and an explorer of the unknown. They are specialists, and in the long run, their quest benefits everyone (including themselves).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133836/#Comment_133836" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T15:54:46+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  3:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron, I'm not sure if you're offering a counter to my examples, or if you're proposing a scenario where these don't become problems.<br/><br/>To me, though, what you're essentially doing is turning both of these guys into dupes.

It has rules for becoming a dupe (completing Key of Revenge and getting the Key of Catspaw, let's call it), and it has rules for turning from dupe to renegade (Key of Catspaw to Key of King-Killer, say).  And what's more, the rules of the game are built to allow you to storm the king's castle and assassinate him.  And it's great!  That's some fine story gaming goodness.

Basically, I used the model of the western gold rush.  There's a region which saw the rise and fall of empires, with cities, and catycombs, and tombs, and wizard towers from half a dozen successive civilizations until civilization collapsed, the region was overrun and the remnants of society pushed back to the coasts.  Then centuries later, a few daring explorers penetrated this ancient frontier and discovered vast wealth left abandoned by the ancients in amidst their ruins.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the easy picking are gone, but always there are rumors of a "new find" a new lost city or underground labyrinth that may still hold forgotten treasurers.  And so, much like prospectors founding joint stock companies to work claims too large for any one man alone, teams of delvers found joint stock companies with the assistance of eastern investors to penetrate the ruins and bring back treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; style dungeon crawls, where there's a monster around every corner, the payoff is probably pretty low.  But with a more reasonable dispursion of "creatures" (based on actual territory large enough to support them)...I don't imagine the danger is really much greater than prospectors faced in the Klondike...and men flocked there by the thousands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133872/#Comment_133872" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T20:19:21+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  8:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the 1st edition AD&amp;D DM's guide suggested parallels between dungeon crawling and the gold rush, didn't it?

I've been reading a lot of "scheming nobles" type books lately, so I just took a more cynical route.<br><br>Here's another take: if you've got dungeons all over the place, it stands to reason that the ones that are the most conveniently located are going to get cleaned out first. Sure, some orcs or bandits or a baby dragon or whatever might hole up their later, but that's nothing compared to the riches and dangers to be found in the <i>really</i> inaccessible ones. The local stuff, the dungeons where you can just stop at an inn, get directions, and ride there, those are strictly minor league. They're for amateurs, thrillseekers, bored rich kids or desperately poor kids. But for a select few, they're also <i>practice.</i><br><br>For your aspiring Professional Adventurer, there comes a time when the local dungeons just aren't going to cut it anymore. They've paid their dues, honed their chops and now they're ready for the big time. But just <i>getting</i> to those kinds of dungeons is expensive and dangerous. We're not just talking about tying your horse up outside the Caves of Chaos and whacking a few goblins before lunch, we're talking about sailing the Seas of Molten Blood for 40 days and 40 nights searching for the Isle of Flaming Peril -- and let me tell you, they're not exactly running a regular <i>ferry service</i> across the Seas of Molten Blood. No, dungeoneering on this scale involves mounting a full-fledged expedition.<br/><br/>Expeditions aren't cheap, even by mid-level adventurer standards. If you want to get into dungeon delving of <i>that</i> magnitude, you need a patron. You get some rich noble to fund your expedition, in exchange for a hefty percentage of the profits -- and to do <i>that</i> you're definitely going to need an agent (whom you're paying a commission) and a party manager (who's also getting a cut), and you'll probably also want a contract lawyer, an accountant and a team of PR bards to boot. All of that adds up, so while there's lots of money to be made in the dungeon business, how much of it are you <i>really</i> taking home?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133879/#Comment_133879" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T21:32:31+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  9:32PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2008 9:34PM by noclue.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, I'm thinking about the folks that risk their lives for economic gain in the real world as possible models for this 'delver' culture. I don't believe that there needs to be only one approach or motivation for dungeon crawling. There's a few different reasonsI can see.<br/><br/>Someone looking for a big score, like a jewel thief, bank robber, con man, etc.<br/><br/>Desperate people, muggers, carjackers, junkies, etc. These folks do risky things over and over for small rewards, but feel they have few options.<br/><br/>People who take risks because they feel they are part of a special group dedicated to a greater purpose. Mafia families and street gangs, but also soldiers, police officers, humanitarian aid workers, firemen. Often the pay is good, but not good enough to offset the risks they take without the overarching purpose. Definitely the pay is never good enough to make stopping easy.<br/><br/>Those with mouths to feed. This might include iron workers and crab fishermen and ice truck drivers. These people may feel pride in their work and a sense of comraderie, but primarily they are trying to earn a living as best they can.<br/><br/>The culture could easily have all of these and more operating at the same time.<br/><br/>EDIT: the interesting thing for me is that different adventurers might be willing to take different types of risk depending upon their reason for adventuring in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133881/#Comment_133881" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T21:36:42+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  9:36PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hah!

They bought a headquarters and everything too, with a little shrine to departed members of the party, some magical traps and a training room.  Their prime motivation for gaining money became to pimp out their HQ.  <br/><br/>Of course, they had to fire the agent when they found out he'd been working both sides of the deal - he hired the evil sorcerer's protection detail as well.

Always mixing morals and business.<br/><br/>I whispered something to Justin in another thread that seems slightly on topic now. Josh's idea for an economic model for dungeon crawling made me think about ways that assets are monetized. For example, the stock market. If there was an exchange established, adventurers could incorporate and offer shares to investors who were willing to pay for part of the loot. Those shares could then be freely traded on the exchange. Or dungeoneer's insurance policies could be purchased to insure against certain risks with insurance agents who would examine the adventurer's or party's strengths and weaknesses and sell policies depending upon what resistance they expected the PCs to meet in the dungeon. Lloyd's of London got its start underwriting trading ships, which is not without risk. Or how about timeshares? A town could band together to buy 2 weeks of a renowned wizard or a band of warriors. <br/><br/>OK, so its not very on topic, but generally if you have a worker economy, the capital-owning class will find a way to monetize it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133899/#Comment_133899" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T23:13:02+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 11:13PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I'm thinking endorsement deals. <br/><br/>"Bjornvig's <i>+2 shield</i> furnished by Magenverrottenbier Genuine Dwarven Ale: the Dourest Beer is the Twelve Kingdoms."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133901/#Comment_133901" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T23:25:16+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 11:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>Now I'm thinking endorsement deals.<br/><br/>"Bjornvig's<i>+2 shield</i>furnished by Magenverrottenbier Genuine Dwarven Ale: the Dourest Beer is the Twelve Kingdoms."</blockquote>\nI love that.

The society begins with delver culture supported under the patronage system like that of the middle ages. However, as the rising mercantile class gains power, the delvers start to realize that there's more money and prestige to be made working for these upstart commoners in their cities. The merchants for their part see the delvers as a source of rare and wondrous treasure that they can trade. Of course, many still hold to the old ways, the noble art of dungeoneering, passed down from generation to generation.<br/><br/>Edit: Josh let me know if we've strayed into a useless tangent to your design goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133920/#Comment_133920" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T04:25:35+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  4:25AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019d go for an expanding country/kingdom/empire.

The basic problem comes down to the idea that a character could expect to fight against orcs and stay alive after more than a few fights. Statistically, unless the orc really is weaker and demonstrably so, the odds on actually surviving a dungeon become slim very quick. I mean we're not actually going to propose that it's even odds, right? A 50% chance to die each time. That would make success of any sort dubious. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe characters must know that they're somewhat invulnerable. Maybe not 100%, but the odds on any given fight, unless they go badly wrong somehow, they can count on surviving. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that true in your world? Or, do we assume that they do not know, and simply handwave the motives of the characters calling them "Heroic"? Because that's your only other option, it seems to me. Either it's unrealistic, and we just live with that, or the characters know that they can hack it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they're relatively certain that they can, in fact, make it to retirement, or even live to get one bag of gold, at least, then they'll potentially go for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the problem with the Gold Rush analogy. Ignore for a moment the fact that the people involved in the gold rush may have just put the danger in the back of their heads, or just been oblivious to it. They're all expecting to live through the experience, and, more importantly, by not getting into any mortal combat. Bear attacks? Rare. Bandits? They don't actually murder people all that often. And, most importantly, the miner is hoping to avoid these things, and just walk away with the gold after some digging or panning. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot so the dungeoneer, apparently. He has to figure that he's going to get into fights. OK, maybe on his first foray into the dungeon, he's oblivious. But once he's been through one, and has fought five combats, he's now aware of what the actual situation is, and he knows that the dangers exist. And he knows that if he goes in again, this is what he faces. His expectations have now been reset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm pretty sure any 49er who did get attacked by a bear would, if he sirvived, and thought it likely to happen again, would reconsider his occupation. <br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D always simply handwaved this, saying that "Adventurerers" are "heroic" and left it completely unrealistic. Fine, it's fantasy. But you're either going to have to swallow that same assumption, or the characters know - rightly - that they are very capable of dealing with whatever comes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's even hard to believe, because... well dragons! When playing Final Fantasy, I've always wondered just howintheheck these little pipsqueaks are hitting titanic dragons hard enough to hurt them. And what happens if they miss an orc, and it alerts an army of orcs? <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, in fact in D&amp;D, characters really are that tough, at some point. But not at starting levels. So you're going to have to have an explanation of why it is characters are that tough in your world, even to start. <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that we'll handwave the part about how the dungeon always has the right number of foes to make it the right difficulty of challenge... or does the dungeoneering guild scry the dungeons and give hints on what they think the content is? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes my head spin.

Sure, I could design something that worked better for what I wanted than the original rules, but they'd always be house rules, and it messed with the essentially gamist premise of D&amp;D, which is mastering the given rules.  But I absolutely could not reconcile the kind of world we were playing in with the rules of the game we were playing.  So I changed the world.<br/><br/>Player Characters became superheroes.  Hit Points made you well-nigh impossible to kill.  You could hit harder, faster and more accurately than anyone else.  And not anyone could go up levels.  Only certain gifted people could do it, and only with training from the right organization.  There were a handful of recognized "paths" to this power, which gave different abilities - classes.  <br/><br/>And everyone in the world knew it.  There were standard rates for hiring these people.  People would carefully assess the level of the threat they were facing, and would hire the right level of adventurer to deal with the threat.  Well-known dungeons were mapped according to level.  <br/><br/>Adventuring parties are a business.  They need to stay small, so they get a good return on each mission, and so they can keep expenses down.  Roughly four people ensures a good mix of skills and power to deal with most threats.  There's some competition between the different parties - competition for lucrative jobs, and also some rivalry.  Some groups will take any job to get ahead. Others are more scrupulous.  <br/><br/>The effect on the game was enormous.  Everything started to make sense.  If the rules made for a weird situation, then that's just how the world worked.  The City Watch had special teams for dealing with rogue adventurers, with all kinds of equipment that exploited rules loopholes the get around the level difference (Nets! They force an opposed Strength test that's not affected by level! Tower Shields!).  The players really got into the business side of their adventuring party.  The politics also became really interesting - the rivalries between groups, what they would and wouldn't do.  It was cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134319/#Comment_134319" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T08:16:13+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  8:16AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that makes it viable, Simon...

Then came D&amp;D.; One of the D&amp;D; classes, fighting men, had included in it's level names hero for 4th level and super hero for 8th level.

I'll indulge myself and talk about that a bit in the hopes that it will help the JBR with his game. <br/>Basically, as per Simon's game, we assumed that the game rules are the physics of the D&amp;D world. The fact that you can shoot a fireball a precise number of feet based on your mage level and that there is specific spell access based on level means that there are in-world measurable ways of determining the level of spell-casters. As such, it makes sense that this sort of idea could be extended to fighters and rogues, etc. though it would probably range within about 3 points of to-hit bonus since that should be easily detectable. For example, by watching fights between untrained village youth, you could determine that the average untrained person hits someone not wearing armor about 50% of the time, but a "third-level" fighter hits about 65% of the time. <br/>Now as far as fitting into the world, one of the assumptions of Forgotten Realms is that the reason there are so many tiny nations and independent city-states is that having a couple of 20th level adventurers living in a city or ruling it, means that they can effectively hold off armies and subjugate nearby towns at whim. Which TOTALLY MAKES SENSE if you accept the D&amp;D rules as the physics of the universe. After all, even a mid-level mage is far harder to destroy (has more hitpoints) than an iron door. <br/>So if the physics of the universe decree that certain people are essentially super-powered and that there are similarly super-powered threats, a lot of the assumptions of dungeon-crawling begin to make sense. Why send 4 people instead of an army? Because the army would be decimated, even though they might eventually slay the dragon by sheer force of numbers. <br/>In at least one campaign we played (based out of Waterdeep) there was an Adventurer's Guild whose job it was to match up adventurers with appropriately difficult work. As such, they got a 10% cut of any rewards the adventurers got. Similarly, they acted as a clearing-house for old adventuring gear sold at a discount by people who no longer needed it because they either had something better or were retiring. We worked this as random treasure rolls for magic items that could sometimes be purchased on the cheap. <br/>In almost every campaign we've ever played, the party ends up hiring or acquiring through the Leadership feat a PR-person/manager. This person's job is to hire bards to sing about us, to set up deals with inns so that we can eat/drink/stay there for free, and to get our likenesses put on mugs, tabards, and similar. Occasionally we'll cut a deal where we promote a blacksmith's services or a leatherworker's goods as the ones we all use. At high levels, these kinds of 10-gold freebies don't even matter, but it makes everything more "believable." Why WOULDN'T you go out and set up those kinds of deals? <br/>Lastly, our party manager is usually tasked with opening up a store to sell party memorabilia and to act as a sales center for all the junk we pick up in dungeons including statues, furniture, tapestries, anything nice, really. <br/>And that's how we rock the economic model. The party ends up being super-stars who get a lot of things for free and who like being famous. <br/><br/>One of the things we've also done that I haven't seen very often is we've played lower-level dungeons. Like we did the Sunless Citadel when we were 12th level. Not knowing what was in the dungeon, we started out cautiously and ran it like any other dungeon. But by the end we were picking up hobgoblins and throwing them down mineshafts and impaling multiple kobolds with a single arrow. In short, we were murderous super-heroes fighting evil 3 year-olds. <br/>By the time we reached 18th level, most of the members of the party were never going to die of old age. Many of us only ate or drank for pleasure and only slept for 2 hours each night (Rings of Sustenance). We only feared death for the momentary pain it brought and the hit to the wallet, knowing that we would be back the next day at full strength. We completely wrecked the economy of a small town for fun by giving the local orphan 2000 gold. And some of us started to worry that we weren't human anymore. Because in a lot of ways high-level adventurers aren't human - they're demigods. <br/>And knowing that if you can get past those first two or three dungeon crawls and become a demi-god or a rockstar or wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice seems like it would be a huge incentive. Especially because once you have your stake saved up you don't have to fear violent death unless all of your friends die with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134637/#Comment_134637" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T13:11:04+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  1:11PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somebody I know wrote a game called "Of Gods and Men" in which the pretext behind leveling was that, in fact, you were trying to achieve apotheosis. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question I have with many of these ideas is now more like... why are we going to such lengths to save this old gaming cliche.

To me at least. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134686/#Comment_134686" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T15:01:22+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  3:01PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The further along this discussion goes, the more I'm beginning to realize that yes, dungeoneering makes no sense.<br/><br/>On the other hand, things that make no sense often make extremely fun games.  I mean, starfighters make no sense.  Giant mecha make absolutely no sense.  Punching a Nazi off the top of a burning zeppelin makes no sense.  Massive supernatural conspiracies make no sense.<br/><br/>My interest in things that make sense is dramatically lower when I'm sitting down to play a game, apparently.  All those fun games in all those settings that were totally ridiculous, and not once did I ever stop and say, "Why would anyone ever do anything like this?  What kind of world would I need for this to be a reasonable activity?"  But then, I've always liked games that felt more like fiction than nonfiction, so maybe my tolerance for goofiness is higher?  (Or my antipathy towards grittiness, for that matter?)<br/><br/><br/>This is still a very interesting thread full of great material, but I can't help wondering if anyone else is starting to think "...so what exactly is better about a setting where there's an economic basis for adventurers looting dungeons, anyway?"  Or is it just so people who want more grit and less goof in their settings can still take their PCs in to plunder Undermountain without being annoyed at how nonsensical it all is?

In point of fact, the rewards from even Keep on the Borderlands are damned-near enough to live on indefinitely... as a peasant. You've sort of stacked the deck, to set things up differently.<br/><br/>So the simplest economic basis for dungeoneering is that they maintain a very slothful, expensive lifestyle. No trade, no farming, no production of goods (hush about Magic Items, m'kay?), no hunting. Sitting around in Inns all day, or practicing very narrowly applicable skills, or wandering from place to place. Paying out of pocket for every damned things: each meal, every night's rest, tools of your trade, repairs of same, women (until that Fame kicks in), etc, etc.<br/><br/>You want an economic basis?
