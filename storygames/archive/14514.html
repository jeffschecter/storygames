Apart from two sessions of 3:16, my touch with indie/story games has been quite theoretical - not in the strict sense of the word, but in that I don't basically read any trad games anymore (I don't have the time to read so many pages of stuff I don't really need to play) - so this was something of change.<br/><br/>We had three players and afterwards everyone was of the opinion that four or five would be ideal. Now we made up a couple of NPCs to clusterfuckify the situation.<br/><br/>I wasn't very good at explaining the rules despite having read them just last night, so the setup took surprisingly long. But it was really fun and exciting in a way that I hadn't realised. I liked how the pieces started to come together, and the whole phase where you had to choose what details to decide was a fun game in itself.<br/><br/>In a nice Southern town, we had a local big boss Willy Ray, his nephew Osmond, and a corrupt councilman Barbara (I played her). The councilman bought marijuana from Osmond, but had recently changed the supplier to an out-of-towner Matt ("NPC" created from Osmond &amp; Barbara's Need), and lesbian porn from Willy Ray - with a shipment of really nasty kinky stuff (Object: Porn Stash) now lost, with something to identify Barbara by in there.<br/><br/>The first scene felt intimidating for everyone, so Willy Ray's player decided that he would resolve. The scene happened at a cafe, which wasn't a Location, and Barbara confronted Willy Ray about the lost shipment. The player chose a bad outcome for Willy Ray, so Barbara left the situation with the upper hand. Sadly, that shaped Willy Ray for the rest of session, who turned out to be a fat, greasy man who only tried to cover his position. The player did a great job color-wise, i.e. portraying the character, but conflict-wise the character was poor.<br/><br/>Barbara made a deal with Osmond that they should wipe out both Willy Ray and the out-of-towner Matt, and Osmond agreed, since he Needed to get even with Matt . Then came the tilt, for which we chose Cold-blooded settling of scores and Something precious on fire. Matt attacked Osmond, but Osmond killed him; then Barbara and Osmond lit up Willy Ray's trailer while Willy Ray was asleep there, after which Barbara hit Osmond with a stone and put him in the back of Willy Ray's pick-up. Willy Ray woke up to a telephone, tried to put out the fire, and collapsed, badly burnt, outside the trailer.<br/><br/>Osmond managed to escape, and Barbara got pulled over by the police. She managed to explain the situation to her favor.<br/><br/>But the Aftermath didn't favor poor Barbara, who got a zero; she killed the other police officer, got maimed by the other one, and maimed, went to prison, reputed for being a cop-killer and a lesbian kiddy porn addict in the deep South. Osmond got White 12, so he skipped town and made a new life for himself, even got to college. Willy Ray got Black 14 (Black 22 - White 8) and returned to running his empire, with new great hair (after the burn, his hair grew better than ever before).<br/><br/>All in all, we thought it was fun, even though we have a lot to learn. Like I said, everyone felt that more players would've enhanced the experience, and the first few scenes were maybe a bit conflict-averse. We didn't know what was coming so we weren't driving everything toward conflict at full-speed; well, I might've, but it might be just my bias, or then it's because I've read the bloody book and Jesse's old* Sorcerer threads and other indie conflict stuff lately.<br/><br/>Some of the Establishing phases didn't go smoothly, either. When the player in turn chose to resolve, the Establishers said too much, maybe, describing more than the initial setup (When, Who, Where etc.) and too far into what sorts of stuff has happened and what's everyone's motivation in the scene and so on. Resolving felt natural, though.<br/><br/>Willy Ray's player also tried something nice, i.e. she made one scene about her character's fate, although the character wasn't there. She just described Willy Ray driving away in his pick-up, listening to country music, and told that Barbara and Osmond should discuss what to do with Willy Ray (and Matt). That was really cool, actually.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to playing it again, but I'm not going to run it at a con until I've had a few sessions under my belt. One of us felt that maybe it wasn't suited to cons in the first place but requires familiarity with the rules to really shine; I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>But my story-gaming needs have been satisfied for a while. Instant conflict, no unnecessary crunch in the characters, concentrate on what's important and cool. I feel good. Thanks, Jason!<br/><br/>* It feels silly to call old something that was only three years ago.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330651/#Comment_330651" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T16:41:49+00:00" title="June 18, 2011  4:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your instincts are good - four players is the sweet spot.

It teaches people some really awesome and basic skills to RP that are so often missed, and never developed. At Free RPG day last year I ran Shab-al-Hiri Roach, and everyone had a blast with that. This year many of the same players came back to play Fiasco, it went great, despite the fact there a total of 9 player in the group. It still only took us about 5 hours to get through the 36 scenes. Everyone was hitting their marks and moving along. It goes to show that it can handle a wide range of players. <br/><br/>Just to share, we played "Lucky Strike." We spent the majority of the game giving each other Gonorrhea, being captured by the "Jewish Reclamation Malitia", and then we all became cannibals....<br/><br/>I then ran it at Meetup on Sunday with only 3 players, a big difference, it took maybe an hour and a half. We still played through a very detailed and interesting story with that low a number of scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330872/#Comment_330872" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T15:32:54+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  3:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm so stealing the phrase "to clusterfuckify":)<br/><br/>But seriously, sounds like you felt your way around the first session well enough.

Because there aren't that many scenes available, you need to get at the good stuff right now and not waste time. Now, I'm not saying I'm not longing for the, um, Tarkovskyan rhythm every now and then, but I've sometimes used the slow tempo just because I was afraid to bring conflict into play. In Fiasco, there's no time for that.<br/><br/>Of course, now I'm wondering what a Tarkovskyan playset would be like, and how would a group facilitate such a session.<br/><br/>During the session, I felt a little afraid to hurt or kill other players' characters, which I thought was a weakness on my part, but thinking about it afterwards, maybe I just followed my good instincts. I never killed the other characters in my scenes, merely hurt them enough to make it a success on my part and left their fates to their own scenes.<br/><br/>I'm having a new session on Sunday, with different people, which I expect will be smoother just because I know how the rules work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331476/#Comment_331476" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T11:11:04+00:00" title="June 24, 2011 11:11AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: halski</cite>During the session, I felt a little afraid to hurt or kill other players' characters, which I thought was a weakness on my part, but thinking about it afterwards, maybe I just followed my good instincts.

For some groups, it can be a lot of creepiness leading up to a knife in the gut in someone's last scene. Which is totally cool.<br/><br/>In the games I facilitate, I write down each NPCs name on a 3x5 card and throw it in the middle of the table. If (when) one of them gets killed, we rip the card in half. It doesn't lead to a bloodbath, but everyone is very aware that these NPCs lives are hanging by a thread. Also, it provides a good visual clue if someone wants to put the two card-halfs together for a flashback scene:)<br/><br/>As for the PCs, I tell everyone that killing other PCs is fine, but just try to follow two rules:<br/>1. Make it meaningful.<br/>2. Try to do it after the Tilt.<br/><br/>Have fun and report back on your next session!!

The other three players were newbies, all part of my regular gaming group. We've mostly played Call of Cthulhu and Savage Worlds together, with a freeformish style, with a lot of color and fun IC banter, interrupted by the occasional mechanical instrusion and combat - a very trad approach, which works ok because the roleplaying bits are terrific and combat system's nifty, even though they don't support each other very well.<br/><br/>Our session of Fiasco had a lot of that flavour, too. We chose the McMurdo station and it was, can you imagine, a whole lot more claustrophobic than a nice Southern town. Four characters, mostly at an observing station near a penguin colony. Movie script-ically speaking, the only locations were INT An Antarctic Tractor (or whatchacallit) and INT and EXT A Research Station Near the Penguins.<br/><br/>As a result of the setup, there were two distracting factors for me:<br/><br/>1) Other people chose the Relationships and Details for my character, and as a result I had a professional rivalry with an SO corporate scumbag wanting to exploit the large penguin colony, and was an ecological extremist with another player. The soft-hearted hippie that I am, I didn't want the penguins to get hurt, and consequently I didn't want my character to end up badly. In my first game, I thoroughly enjoyed playing the despicable councilman and making bad decisions for her; now I couldn't do that, but I only realised it after the game.<br/><br/>2) The scenes mostly flowed along and followed each other organically. It was fun, but because the scenes pretty much followed each other, the only major difference between them was the character in spotlight. And consequently I mostly wanted to Resolve. And the tough choices between Establishing and Resolving are *so* much fun. <br/><br/>What worked? Among other things, it was a murder mystery in which no of us knew what had happened! There were only four characters around and the game began when two of them found a body and a list of people to kill. It was fun trying to figure out what had happened. I was prepared to go all The Thing, but one of the other players decided to make his character a mundane serial killer.<br/><br/>Anyway, now I feel like running two sessions of it at a con!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332390/#Comment_332390" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T22:57:25+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 10:57PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Your instincts are good - four players is the sweet spot.
