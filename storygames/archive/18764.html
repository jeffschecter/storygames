Our <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1557256029/crooked-and-other-oddities-from-broken-eye-books" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter </a>features novels and short stories by many RPG authors that you're all likely familiar with. There's only a few days left.<br/><br/>It's full of wonderfully weird tales from many wonderful writers: Richard Pett, Clinton Boomer, Dave Gross, Elaine Cunningham, Erik Scott De Bie, Shanna Germain, and more.  <br/><br/>Richard Pett creeps you out with Crooked, weird horror set in a pseudo-Victorian and phantasmagorical fantasy world. It's equal parts Lovecraft and Conan-Doyle. Steampunk? Maybe, but I prefer to think of it as corpsepunk. <br/><br/>And then Clinton Boomer takes you on a retro-post-apocalyptic adventure in Soapscum Unlimited and unveils a superhero mystery (with co-writer Stephen Norton) in Questions. <br/><br/>Then there's the wonderfully twisted dark fantasy anthology By Faerie Light, featuring many of the authors you already love: Dave Gross, Jennifer Brozek, James Sutter, Elaine Cunningham, Erin Hoffman, Shanna Germain, Cat Rambo, Lillian Cohen-Moore, Erik Scott de Bie, Ed Greenwood, and more! <br/><br/>Erik Scott de Bie, author of five D&amp;D novels, has joined the crew with a new novel stretch goal. His Scourge of the Realm is a twisted fantasy world. The villain lies defeated and the heroes have ascended, but what happens when evil lingers and turns the champions of light into something far worse? <br/><br/>Plus, there are more goodies planned for Clinton Boomer's fan-favorite urban fantasy tale The Hole Behind Midnight: illustrations by Hugo Solis, an audiobook, new stories by Boomer, and more!<br/><br/>Let us keep you stocked with awesome reading throughout the next year!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
