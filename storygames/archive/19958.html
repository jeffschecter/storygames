In Mahabba.<br/>Mahabba is a super conservative city so two of the guys were veiled. The negative charisma urchin wasn\u2019t.<br/><br/>First, they were in some city shenanigans. They wanted to meet in a tavern and I rolled one up from Vornheim. I asked one of the players (DW style) \u201cWhy does your character feel safe here?\u201d and got some story from that. I had some pre-created city NPCs and one of them, a \u201cbird guy\u201d (a kenku) I said they saw him at the tavern but they didn\u2019t follow him.<br/>Later they split up.<br/><br/>One went to the bazaar (and there I had some of the pre-generated NPCs and their weird antics that they saw a brief glimpse at). I used Red Tide\u2019s tags to generate these ahead of time (along with Donjon\u2019s (the website, not Nixon\u2019s game) NPC generator). A trading post that has some weird items and some internal conflicts and the bird guy wants to steal from them.<br/><br/>One went to an NPC that he had created himself(??? Czege principle?) as part of his bond. A wizard that teaches magic to street kids. I had the wizard make the PC promise \u201cDon\u2019t go to the 3 statues in the desert!\u201d (Of course the PC broke the promise at the first available opportunity.)<br/><br/>One went looking for trouble and I had him run into one of the encounters from Vornheim, a noble, that he stole from and he then followed to a tower I kind of winged.<br/>Here is were my new rule of not rolling for initiative immediately shone: he was chased away from the kitchen entrance by angry mamluks and they got a few swipes at him (they missed). If I had \u201croll for initiative\u201d he would\u2019ve been more likely to fight to the death I think!<br/><br/>All three routes went fine and all three methods of having city adventures were fine. I had some trepidation for the \u201cout of the dungeon\u201d part of running al-Qadim but now I feel pretty comfortable about it. I was switching back and forth between them rapidly, one player at first said \u201cUgh, why are we doing it like this, finish one story and then go to the next\u201d but I\u2019ve ran enough split parties to know that no matter how you do run a split party, it\u2019s going to be boring. In the end I was happy with my choice.<br/>All of the NPCs that were newly discovered, I recorded on index cards. My \u201cDM wiki\u201d is a small box of index cards.<br/><br/>Then they joined up, had some more shenanigans as they stole a map to the weird statues.<br/>Then they went there (I placed B4 The Lost City, which is originally from Mystara, a little outside Mahabba which is from the al-Qadim setting. Totally different planet, but... I wanted something simple and old-school).<br/><br/>Their trapfinding and detective work as they made their way down into the dungeon was awesome to watch and I really loved this part of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>A spoiler for B4 The Lost City to follow.<br/>In one of the rooms without much warning was 7 stirges and they got TPK:d by these stirges.<br/>They asked for a time rewind but after the time rewind a lot of the good mood and interesting tension had gone from the room and we quickly wrapped up after a few more rooms.<br/><br/>The time rewind sucked (perhaps even worse than rolling up new chars), me not giving them good enough warning that stirges were in the room sucked, and me not letting them slam the door on the stirges before they flew out sucked. They would not deliberately fight 7 stirges, they already know that much. Most of all, the stirges sucked blood.<br/><br/>So kind of a feelbad ending to a previously great session that the players complimented me for, overall.<br/>Was happy... but ended on a sour note.<br/><br/>PS.<br/>Also a spoiler for B4 The Lost City: In one of the room there are some save-or-die bees. I felt that there were ample warning so I let them loose on the party and they managed to defeat them. But I missed the fact that the bees were supposed to be one foot long, so it was an interesting fight against tiny tiny bees that they tried to catch.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441335/#Comment_441335" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-11T21:50:32+00:00" title="January 11, 2015  9:50PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you think of adventurer defeat in D&amp;D after experiencing what looks to me like a textbook TPK?

I'm not telling a particular characters story, I'm exploring these player's choices in a persistant setting through various characters.<br/><br/>Here, several things conspired to tempt us into the time rewind. 1: We had spent the first half of the session establishing these characters and their world. 2: These players are still slow at making 5e characters. Or they want to do it with care. 3: The players really protested the "unfair" encounter. 7 stirges are way beyond deadly for three level one characters without henchmen. In fairness, I should've let them slam the door on the stirges. Reading the module text carefully, it seems to imply that that's intended. Stirges can't be outrun once they attach. So I also regretted the encounter. It's not like they willingly entered combat with them.<br/><br/>But the sourest note of all was the time rewind. In one way it really drained a lot of the tension and fear from the game. Rolling up new characters to go on a "rescue mission" could've been fun. I don't know.<br/><br/>But it's less the TPK and more the "unfair" TPK that was the issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441338/#Comment_441338" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-11T23:45:24+00:00" title="January 11, 2015 11:45PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2015 11:46PM by 2097.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've had character death before, including once when everyone except one died from an owlbear, but the only times they've asked for time rewinds have been stirges, they really hate them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441339/#Comment_441339" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-12T00:07:23+00:00" title="January 12, 2015 12:07AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience has also been that time rewinding is usually a bad idea. It doesn't really help much, and it robs the game of any grace it might have achieved by good sportsmanship. Instead, maybe consider the rich and compelling background established earlier as a way to quickly bring new characters into the game: the depth of past characters may in this manner be salvaged in developing new ones.<br/><br/>One thing that the GM could do in reorienting the group towards the future after a TPK of this type is to admit to it having been a somewhat clumsy setup on their part, encourage immediately creating new characters, and provide those characters with some sort of extra bonus advantage to "make up" for the bad call earlier. Sort of admission of fault combined with a bribe, with the effect of making the group eager to try again instead of dwelling on the collective failure. (Yes, the GM claims the fault despite the failure really being collective in nature, to whatever degree; this makes sense because moving on is more important than guilt in this situation.)<br/><br/>I've sort of used that technique myself (although not with a whole group at once, I think), in which case the "gifts" I've carried in my role as a penitent GM have been opportunities to play rare character classes or to start with a particularly tied-in character background. For example: "To make up for a somewhat crude and brutal outcome, I'd like to offer the unique opportunity of making your next character a member of this monastic community you were trying to help just now." That sort of thing. Outright money and xp work too, of course, but giving xp particularly causes inflation, which is why I'd rather not. An interesting background that implies a modicum of wealth works fine, though.<br/><br/>In case anybody's confused on the point, I don't recommend bribing players just because there was a failure. The reason I suggest it here is because the group is not considering the defeat legitimate, despite clearly having an idea of what a legitimate defeat would look like. That actually <i>is</i> a GM failure (not in any sinful way - more like missing a catch in a ballgame), so it's appropriate to acknowledge that, clear the air and continue onwards in good spirits.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441346/#Comment_441346" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-12T05:12:36+00:00" title="January 12, 2015  5:12AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm quite curious what a TPK looks like under "seamless" initiative rules.

The party were standing back, ready, as they opened the door and moved back. Neither side gets a surprise round.<br/><b>Call #2: How meaningful is the turn order?</b><br/>Quick recap of my current "seamless" rules:<br/>The golden, most important rule is that the action economy is maintained. Everyone gets one move, one action, one bonus action and one reaction per round. <br/>Everyone is ranked in dex order. That's the fall back, default order things happen in.<br/>In situations where it doesn't matter so much which order things happen in, I can jump around, leaving the turn order according to where the action is or where the engagement is, trying to be a bit more like DW (why I don't just give up and marry DW at this point is beyond me).<br/>In situations where it's very interesting and critical to see who goes first, I might have those participants roll dex for it but I've grown more reluctant to do so.<br/><br/>In this situations, factors that made the order important included that it's a bit of a glass cannon fight on both sides, and that both sides were, an least for now, pretty united into one big m\xealee rather than two or more separate subfights. Factors against the importance included that the stirges were so much faster than the party so it would've been hard to run away. I decided to keep them in the "default" order but break ties in the party's favor. I.e:<br/>+5 Tarras<br/>+3 Rashad<br/>+3 The seven blood-thirsty stirges<br/>+0 Jibril<br/>So the party got in the first couple of strikes but they had bad luck with those.<br/><br/>The only way for the party to run would be to run to the nearest door and either abandon Jibril, slamming the door on him, or wait at the door and have him dex off against the stirges, risking them winning coming out through the door first. Just plain running would've lead them to ladders and they would've been vulnerable while climbing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441351/#Comment_441351" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-12T08:15:44+00:00" title="January 12, 2015  8:15AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this point, my biggest regret was to not hint at a door slam, like "You see seven stirges flying out towards the corridor.

Do you have local mage artificers, engineers, enchanters, armourers? Pick someone who could have made a truly unique item for each "hero" - and they will double as an NPC relationship you can use later in the game.<br/><br/>Each player, therefore, gets to be as clever as they can try to be to prepare themselves for the adventure (knowing very little about it, of course).<br/><br/>Ideally you'd come up with things that are cool (and potential story hooks), which may or may not be relevant to this adventure, and won't change the balance of power too much in the future of the campaign. Things which have limited uses are great, as are overly-specific devices, like, perhaps, alchemically-brewed stirge poison.<br/><br/>(I would also say that what happened to the (dead) characters is not necessarily canon, for additional fun. There's a rumour that they were all killed by stirges, yes, but what really happened, we don't know...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
