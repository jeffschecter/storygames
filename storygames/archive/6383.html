Characters can either start out with a lot of experience or with only a few things defined.  In the latter case, characters can be continually developed through flashback scenes, stories they tell about their past during play, or things that are discovered about them in play.  Imagine it as super-flexible lifepath system that's constantly updating characters to reflect new things that have happened.<br/><br/>2. <b>Unifying traits and relationships.</b> Every trait comes from somewhere or, more likely, someone.  Genetic traits that a character inherits from their parents; social traits gained from their community, friends, and family; knowledge and skills from their teachers; etc.  Each trait is not just an ability but a tie to someone else or a group of someones, a memory of interacting with them.  In this way, you could strongly hate someone from your past, but they still played a big part in making you who you are.<br/><br/>Here's why I'm doing it:<br/><br/>A. I want to be able to roleplay stories like <i>Gilmore Girls</i> and the new <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, where it's all about character development and how much other people contribute to making you who you are.  But I want actual rules that support it, because I get lost trying to care everything through freeform characterization, especially over multiple sessions.  I forget what I'm doing with a character or how they relate to other characters.  I need more assistance to pull it off.  Whether hacking d20 or not, I think this is a worthwhile design goal, for a specific type of play.<br/><br/>B. I want to be able to break down general character traits ("I went to college") into things that actually have meaning, into specific memories of events that happened ("So this one time in college...") and the people who were involved in it.<br/><br/>Here's some of the issues I'm dealing with:<br/><br/>1. How do you convert experiences into traits? Are attribute-giving experiences different from skill-giving or feat-giving experiences?  How do you differentiate?  I don't want to quantify experiences, like, "record three applicable memories to raise an attribute modifier."  That's dumb and just the kind of thing I'm trying to avoid.<br/><br/>2. How do you elegantly keep track of experiences when a character might start out composed of, say, 30 memories and gain at least one or two more each time you play?  How do you keep track of which memories are connected to which traits?  I don't want this to require a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C2%B0ntinuum" rel="nofollow">Continuum</a> level of bookkeeping.<br/><br/>3. What are the real implications of saying that each trait, each experience, also represents a relationship with another person?  How can we manipulate those during play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141214/#Comment_141214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T22:03:06+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 10:03PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'Experience' is a rather lifeless word, really.<br/><br/>Perhaps 'I am hurt by...' followed by the source of hurt, would be the starting point. Then some amount of system use you as a player earn 'solution to the hurt'. It doesn't have to be a genuine solution 'Deny that I'm hurting' is a valid 'solution'.<br/><br/>The 'I am hurt by...' would be defined by players upon being presented with a nasty scene or such by a GM.<br/><br/>The horrible fun thing might be that the way someone solves their hurt, creates a hurt for someone else - and you get these nasty chain reactions. Oh, here's a horrible one - I deny I'm hurting - and that hurts the person who secretly loves me, cause they can see through that hurt. Well, perhaps a little dramatic, but fun to type!<br/><br/>What do you want traits for anyway? For climbing fences or killing goblins(or setting equivalent of gobo's)? My idea here doesn't tie in to much with actual traits - it's more of a generator of fuel for more drama.<br/><br/>Jeez, come to think of it, I really should get around to writing a narrativist game of mine soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141218/#Comment_141218" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T23:05:45+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 11:05PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, Johnathan; first idea - note, this may be no damn good; I'm just throwing stuff at you...<br/><br/>First, take everything that's currently a progressive bonus.  Beat it to death with a stick, and make it into a feat, so all characters are feat-based.   So, for example, my "base attack progression" that's awesome like a fighter is three feats stacked up (Or whatever), and I have a tag on each one.<br/><br/>When you build a character, you grab your feats, and you also create a set of tags - five or ten or however many.  And you tie each feat to one of the tags.  So, "I was trained by Master Yael" is a tag, and connects up to one of my base attack feats (I have three of those), as well as to my flurry of blows.<br/><br/>Follow me so far?<br/><br/>Okay, now for the silly shit.  Each and every feat has several possible conditions - "enhanced", "reduced", whatever suits.  If my base attack feat gets enhanced, I'm a better hitter.  Now, thing is, feats aren't directly screwed with.  <i>Tags are.</i>  When my training by Master Yeal is on the griddle, that does stuff to a fistful of my feats.<br/><br/>...Anyhow, that's one idea.  I'll probably toss a few more at you, if this is the kind of thing you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141232/#Comment_141232" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T06:07:07+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  6:07AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Callan:</b> Yeah, that's the kind of intervening relationships I want, but I want them to also be related to the traits you use to climb fences and kill goblins.<br/><br/><b>Levi:</b> Reducing everything to feats is interesting (especially if the feats were more freeform instead of a set list), but "I was trained by Master Yael" means about as much as "I went to college" to me.

Riffing off your recent posting about this got me thinking about SotC's nifty chargen tools, i.e., the what-my-character-did-during-the-war bit and the inter-PC novels. You could do something similar, where the PCs narrate a short but important (read: defining) scene from their past and, at the conclusion, identify the related mechanical bonus. Example: You could narrate your character's 16th birthday and how he got home and his daddy had got him a special present waiting in the driveway with a big bow on it ... "And that's why my character has '1966 Shelby AC Cobra +3.'"<br/><br/>EDIT: Or, better, "And that's why my character has '1966 Shelby AC Cobra from my dad +3.'"<br/><br/>Or something like that.

Idea <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, 'cuz, hey, I can stab at this all day.<br/><br/>You have, say, ten "standard" uses to which any given trait could be put.  It can be used to attack, defend, boost, compel, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Ye Olde Character Record is a series of blank lines.  Under each each is a row of symbols (each symbol indicates one of these uses).

Um, +1 stamina because he was really rough. In fact, so rough he killed two students during training. Or, it could be left undefined until, sometime, in the middle of play, you have the player respond to a kind old blacksmith aggressively, and invokes "Trained by Master Yael".  Why, you ask. "Because he's coddling his apprentice, just like Master Yael used to do to me.

That's slick.  It's also a bit Nobilis-y, yeah, in that you can use traits for free but have to pay the cost to use them to do non-standard things.  Very nice.  Sounds like a cool way to handly powers &amp; feats, honestly, so they can still be useful if you run out of resources to power them.<br/><br/><b>Bill:</b> That interconnectivity between traits is pretty hot and does seem to show how experiences are combined into a person, instead of just being a random assortment of things.  I'm going to have to think more about this, clearly.<br/><br/><b>Mike / Alvin:</b> That sounds pretty close to what I'm imagining, but I also want there to be a pre-game that establishes some facts about the character, so they're not all Wolverine.  You're probably correct, though, that it would be better to actually play these out as scenes, instead of having them being invented and "unlived" backstory.  So maybe you play out various scenes over the course of character creation, so it's actually more of a part of play instead of a part of prep?<br/><br/><b>Rob:</b> That sounds way cool. Did the characters ever use those traits as relationships instead of swords, for example, or did you mainly use the relationship bits as hooks to craft adventures around?<br/><br/><b>JD:</b> I'm not sure I get what you mean.  I should create a lame character to see if the character creation rules still ultimately makes interesting characters even if players' initial contributions are uncreative and dull?  Is that it?<br/><br/><b>Paul T:</b> Yeah, that's very much what I was getting at with the <i>Battlestar</i> example.  I see it a lot like having SOTC compel power be more generally distributed among the players, who can be like, "No, see, you shouldn't do that... here's a carrot... or a stick!"  But the sole decision remains with the player.  I'm very much into the idea that characters never really get what they were expecting or what they want, but the unexpected things they do get are usually more interesting.  That's what shows like <i>Battlestar</i> and <i>Gilmore</i> and <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> thrive on.<br/><br/>More coming...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141429/#Comment_141429" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T12:45:18+00:00" title="April 27, 2008 12:45PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some thoughts I had in the shower this morning, drawing on stuff from my <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/projects/avatar/" rel="nofollow">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> game and some of the "lessons" stuff that Daniel was talking about before he started working on <i>Do</i>...<br/><br/>One of my general principles about character development in RPGs is that it's way more interesting if characters becomes <i>different</i> instead of <i>better</i>, even though that strongly goes against the idea of levels and advancement in most d20 stuff.  Another principle is that it's better if character development arises from what happens to a character instead of being explicitly chosen by them.  As Shakespeare says in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, some have greatness thrust upon them, despite their best attempts to avoid it.<br/><br/>So what if you start the game with a blank character sheet and all your stats at +0.<br/><br/>Then, you start framing micro-scenes about your childhood, where the player declares what lesson they're attempting to learn, like "I'm going to be the best player on my peewee soccer team."  Then you have a scene about that and actually play out the part where your character tries to score the winning goal in a difficult match, rolling dice for all the conflict-y parts of things.  However, after the scene plays out, and the scene never plays out as simply as you might have hoped, because this is real life, you gain a modifier to the trait that best reflects what you actually learned from that experience.  Maybe it was teamwork or leadership.  Maybe it was endurance for the harsh criticism you received after you failed.<br/><br/>Maybe you play one of these scenes for every 2-3 years of your age, up to a certain cut-off, like 13.  After that, you've learned all the lessons of childhood and are no longer a blank slate that soaks up experiences like a sponge.  Now, it becomes a bit harder to learn things and it will become harder still as you become older and more set in your ways.  Now, your new experiences don't happen in mechanical isolation from everything you've experienced before.  Instead, each new experience is a further development of or a limb branching off of one of your previous experiences.  This could help eventually build the interconnected structure that Bill was talking about.<br/><br/>Yeah?<br/><br/>The only thing I'm not sure about it whether you actually want to play out a shitload of backstory scenes for older characters, because I want people to be able to play 65 yos if they want to.  Hmm...  How can you simulate all those accumulated years of experience without actually playing them out?  Maybe we could do like Mike suggested and give old fogies a resource like Reflection Pool or something, that they could spend later in the game to have flashbacks.  If would be kinda hilarious to have the older characters constantly talking about things that happened when they were younger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141430/#Comment_141430" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T13:39:50+00:00" title="April 27, 2008  1:39PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2008 1:40PM by Valvorik.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><b>Rob:</b>That sounds way cool.
