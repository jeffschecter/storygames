The setting was, of course, a 1930s English country house, in the style of Agatha Christie. The players were myself, my wife Catherine, my son Cei and my daughter Maya. The children are both teenagers.<br/><br/>The Cast:<br/><br/>Sir Rupert Vincent (Me) - His money mostly comes from the Vincent Meat Paste fortune. Mid fifties, overweight and drinks too much.<br/>Lady Daphne Vincent (Catherine) - Sir Rupert's wife, but also wealthy in her own right. Like riding and shooting.<br/>Hannah Vincent (Maya) - Their daughter. Twenty years old, and in the market for a husband.<br/>Frederick (Cei) - The butler. Mid-thirties, and has been with the family for five years.<br/><br/>The relationships were as follows:<br/><br/>Sir Rupert hates Frederick's father.<br/>Hannah is Sir Rupert's heir.<br/>Sir Rupert wants control of Lady Daphne's money.<br/>Hannah won't marry Lady Daphne's choice of husband.<br/>Hannah is being blackmailed by Frederick.<br/>Frederick secretly loves Lady Daphne.<br/><br/>Act One<br/><br/>This is the section of the game before someone is murdered, and involves people jostling to steal influence dice off each other (whilst telling an entertaining story). Sir Rupert got Frederick to sneak a look at Lady Daphne's bank-book, to find out just how much money she had. She caught him in her room doing it, and he failed to turn the situation into a romantic one when she refused to kiss him. Hannah was told that she would be nice to her suitor, Reginald, when he came to tea next Sunday, whilst she convinced her father to make her his sole heir (writing her mother out of the will). <br/><br/>A scene between Lady Daphne and Sir Rupert saw him collapsing with a heart-attack, and being put on a diet of chicken broth and water, for his own good. He persuaded Hannah that if she wanted her mother's money, then her mother would have to predecease him, so that he inherited it, but she'd already got her mother to change her will so that she inherited anyway. And, finally, Frederick was blackmailing Hannah, who was seeing a man without her mother's knowledge, and wanted her to put in a good word for him with her mother.<br/><br/>At the end of the Act, Sir Rupert is found dead - cyanide in his chicken broth.<br/><br/>Act Two<br/><br/>Enter Inspector Chapel, who begins to investigate the moment the butler opens the door.<br/><br/>High points of Act Two included Hannah wrecking her father's study whilst searching for some vital documents (blaming it on burglars, although Frederick knew the truth), and Lady Daphne being persuaded to marry Frederick the butler (after a decent period of mourning). Lady Daphne turned out to be a bit of a loose woman; she had a bastard son from a relationship that was still ongoing, and that Hannah wasn't really Sir Rupert's daughter at all.<br/><br/>Through investigation it turned out that although Lady Daphne had money, it was in fact dependent on her having legitimate heirs. Neither of her children were legitimate, but this wasn't common knowledge. This didn't turn out to be a full enough motive for murder.<br/><br/>The two characters who filler out their motives first were Hannah and Frederick. Hannah was Sir Rupert's sole heir. Whilst it had been determined that Sir Rupert had squandered most of his fortune, Hannah knew, through her current young man, that he owned deeds to some South African gold-mines which were worth far more than he believed. If she inherited, she would be independently wealthy, and free of her mother's influence.<br/><br/>Frederick's father and Sir Rupert had once been joint partners in another South African gold-mine, but Frederick's father had swindled Sir Rupert out of the proceeds. Frederick believed that Sir Rupert wanted to kill him in revenge for his father's action.<br/><br/>Inspector Chapel outlined the cases - Hannah was looking to inherit a vast sum of money, whilst Frederick's motive was, in fact, perceived self-defence.<br/><br/>The dice were rolled, and Inspector Chapel's incisive mind led him to the conclusion that the murderer was Sir Rupert's daughter, Hannah! And she seemed such a nice girl. She did it to inherit the wealth, of course.<br/><br/>The game took us three hours to play. Act One ran very smoothly, but we struggled more with Act Two, as we found phrasing the Investigation questions which explored the motives difficult (and the children were finding the intense, if amusing, role-play mentally taxing as well.) Another game should see us able to build on the experience, and run the second half more smoothly.<br/><br/>What's fun is that there's no precise goal aside from telling the story, so each player can, to some extent, set their own. It's possible to steer the game so that you become an attractive murder victim, and it's also possible to steer things so that you are either the murderer, or you have enough influence to stand a good chance of deciding who the murderer is. I like this. I can also see the point of the rule about ignoring contradictions and inconsistencies; we had plenty but managed to tease a fairly coherent storyline out of the mess.<br/><br/>Good fun - a recommended game as a one-off, but with some replay value.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold" title="kaptainkobold"><img alt="kaptainkobold" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold">kaptainkobold</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306508/#Comment_306508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T23:15:33+00:00" title="December 31, 2010 11:15PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A question: Can Inspector Chapel pick up the Black or White dice?

I'm rather taken with the idea of running a game based around the old BBC series 'Star Cops', with murder most foul happening on a space station or Moon outpost, and an Inspector from the International Space Police Force being sent to investigate.

We sometimes played around with the scene structure a little, where the flow seemed  to merit it. Rather than have Group Scene - Side Scene - Back To Group Scene, we sometimes ran two Side Scenes together. For example, in one round, Hannah and Frederick were the only two characters who hadn't attempted Influence. Hannah wanted to influence Frederick, so she had a side scene with him. When that finished, Frederick decided that he wanted to influence Hannah, and we just ran the scene straight on from the previous one. In addition Inspector Chapel's first scene was a Side Scene with Frederick when he answered the door; this happened before his first group scene. Again, it seemed a natural point to have a conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307623/#Comment_307623" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T07:10:04+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  7:10AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Alan,<br/><br/>I missed this thread before. Sorry about that.<br/><br/>I'm glad you enjoyed the game. It's interesting you played it with your kids: I've heard of people playing it with non-gamers before, but not children, so I'm glad it worked.<br/><br/>You're probably right that it gets rather mentally taxing. Perhaps there should be a mandatory break, like in Montsegur 1244. After two rounds of the second act, for example, you should all take fifteen minutes and do other things.<br/><br/>The game replays very well. Try taking different roles: if you were the patriarch last time, be the daughter next time. And mix things up: put a gardener in or an American cousin.<br/><br/>To answer your specific points: no, Inspector Chapel can't pick up the Black and White dice; and, yes, running Side Scenes together is fine.<br/><br/>I love Star Cops. I'm going to try that variation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
