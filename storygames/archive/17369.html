The version that is out now is an "immediate" PDF version for Kickstarter backers (it even has "Kickstarter" in the file name). In January, backers will get a print version, and if any minor errors/changes are found in he text in the meantime, an updated PDF will be sent in January, as well (I think). My guess is that once the final print and PDF are ready, they'll be for sale for the general market.<br/><br/>That being said, if you want something sooner, you could always contact the designer and see if there are any work-arounds.

It feels weird having the keeper "hold one" on a miss with a lot of these. Doing this often rather than occasionally IMO reduces suspense rather than creating it because doing so is no longer special.  <br/><br/>Telling players to "choose a move" is a little strange too. This goes against "To do it, do it" and would for me, break immersion. <br/><br/>Still, I'm only a few pages into the keeper section so I can't judge fully yet.

You are doing something in the fiction, so you roll dice to resolve it. In tremulus, the rules are framed in the text as being separate from the fiction, something to use to affect the fiction.

I mean, the text makes a specific point of 'take the action to get its effect. In other words, choose your move and roll the dice. This cannot be stressed enough.' <br/><br/>I don't really know what to make of that. This sounds like any traditional game, so why is it so important that it can't be stressed enough? Did the author mean to replicate AW's 'to do it, do it' refrain but muddled it in the rewording? Or is it stressed to distinguish tremulus from AW and other related games?<br/><br/>There are a few phrases here and there that read a bit oddly to me.

I absolutely <i>love</i> the playset idea. Jason Morningstar's Durance has a nearly identical system (I don't think it's accidental, they've been working with him, right?) and it works great, just great. Players have a lot of input towards the setting, but they're still surprised by the result. I love it!<br/><br/>Like some other posters, I've got some issues with the implementation of the Apocalypse engine. Having the Keeper Hold 1 on a player Miss seems <i>so</i> awkward to me. A friend of mine suggested that it was a pacing mechanic, to better emulate the horror genre. I can <i>totally</i> see that! But what then <i>happens</i> when the player fails a roll and the Keeper decides to Hold 1 instead of making a Move? Does the player still fail <i>in the fiction</i>, and have consequences? If so, aren't they getting double consequences for a single Miss? And if not, <i>how does the fiction respond to a Miss?</i> Does <i>nothing</i> happen? It's just...a bit strange to me.<br/><br/>My other issue is with the stats; it's not a big deal but I wish they'd rename them. As it is, the stats sort of imply that they're quantified measurements of the character's abilities, for example: Might and Reason. These sound like they tell me <i>how</i> strong and intelligent my character is. <i>Why</i>, then, do I roll +Reason to <i>dodge a punch</i>? Reason is the catch-all Act Under Pressure stat and I don't understand <i>why</i> that is, when Dungeon World already laid down a pretty solid paradigm for swapping stats with Defy Danger. Someone in another forum has already hacked his game, changing Might to <i>Aggression</i> and Reason to <i>Will</i>. This made my all my issues disappear. So much of it is just presentation. Which brings me to the last thing...<br/><br/>I find it kind of awkward the way they present Moves as literal Things: "the MC uses up one of their hard moves and deals damage to the player" is an <i>actual example</i> they use in the book. My interpretation of hard and soft moves is more descriptive: "when the player does something, the world responds appropriately." Turning hard moves into something you can hoard and dish out at will, as opposed to REACTIONS within the fiction, just feels... I don't know, <i>weird</i> to me.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393827/#Comment_393827" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-18T20:05:39+00:00" title="October 18, 2012  8:05PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2012 8:05PM by Scrape.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm re-reading my post and thinking that it sounds overly critical. <b>I like the game and I'm glad that I backed it!</b> There's a bunch of good stuff in there and the playbooks are totally solid and fun.

It seems like they've developed a totally different view of how the engine works and it's honestly kind of interesting, even if (or maybe <i>because</i>) it clashes with how I use the games. I want to understand it.<br/><br/>Like take this passage, from the description of the Poke Around move (bolding mine): <blockquote>"<i>On a 6 or less, there is either nothing else in the area or <b>the Keeper may hold 1 to use as a hard move at any time</b> and you may attempt to search further.</i>" </blockquote>\nThat's a <i>fundamentally different</i> idea of hard moves than I am used to. What does it <i>look like</i> when the Keeper spends Hold to make a Hard Move in these circumstances? Is it used to make a hard move when no hard move has been set up in the fiction? How would you even do that? You have to set up a hard move in the game fiction, yeah? So <i>why have the Hold</i> if the move makes sense fictionally? This idea of Holding meta currency to dish out bad stuff for the players... it's just <i>different</i>. I'm wondering if this really is just a pacing mechanic or if they play the *world games totally different than I do.

Spend your MC hold to make a hard move when normally you'd make a soft move. Like, instead of saying "something bad is about to happen, what do you do?" you just have the bad thing happen. <br/><br/>2. Honestly, you could just wait until the player is about to make a move and then say "Wait, wait..." and spend the hold to have them autofail, which would give you a pretty similar effect to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. It's like holding their fail until a later moment when it has a real impact, instead of having them always fine demonic tomes when they're seaching through the newspaper archives.<br/><br/>3. Decide on a specific agenda for your hold (like: furthering a diabolical scheme of some kind) and then spend the hold to basically advance a countdown clock that moves things forward towards that outcome. <br/><br/>In general, it seems like the confusion comes from MCs feeling like they have to make a hard move "out of nowhere," without the fictional positioning that makes it possible. That doesn't make sense. However you do it, you need to spend your hold to make moves that you have the positioning to make, which is why I like the 3 options above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393921/#Comment_393921" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T11:24:24+00:00" title="October 19, 2012 11:24AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2012 11:27AM by Scrape.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Options 1 and 3 look pretty cool to me; personally I don't like autofailing a player but spending Hold to turn a soft move into a Hard one is really appealing. I think <i>that's</i> how it should read in the text, because the game text as-is sort of implies that the Keeper just spends a hold and Deals Damage... then justifies it afterward with a fictional result.<br/><br/>In fact, a lot of the game text reads this way, check this out, it's from a play example in the book: "<i>The Keeper takes a hard move against [the character], who suffers 2 harm as the brute pummels him.</i>" It definitely prioritizes the moves <i>before</i> the fiction.

You shine a light down the passage, both ways. You roll 4. You find nothing.<br/><br/>I take one of my evil-looking tokens, perhaps one of my red-black mahogany-stained Jenga blocks, and I start building the Black Tower. Because I have decide that the monster saw you, and now it is following you!<br/><br/>What do you do? You keep poking around because you have "story-games brain damage" and you want something to happen, good or bad. You go down the passageway and find a room. You roll a 6 this time, but nobody is there to help you. I add another block to the tower. You suffer a coughing fit because of all the dust, but you find an iron maiden, some ancient bottles of pirate rum, and a book that looks very occult and evil.<br/><br/>What do you do? You decide to poke around in the book. You roll snake eyes! You are a "bad player" (Burning Wheel HQ joke), but I do not add more blocks. You study some scribbles in Latin, reading them aloud, and the book starts to smoke! Fire leaps from the pages and you hear the horrible moanings of a thousand dead sinners!<br/><br/>What do you do? Oh, wait, I know, you shine your flashlight directly into the face of the horrible monster! I take a block off the tower. Your mind is wrenched loose and insanity grips you! Then the monster grips you! I take away the second block and the monster grinds your bones and tears your flesh!<br/><br/>Now you've just suffered a bunch of insanity and physical harm and you're in an underground room with a monster and a book that is opening a gate to hell.

This is the most important part (other than the agenda) of <b>always saying what the principles demand</b> and telling a Keeper how to MC the game in the story game fashion (with limited prep) as hinted at in the Playset of Ebon Eaves. I have a pretty good idea, having been immersed in AW / DW for a few years, but what about someone who hasn't?<br/><br/>There is also no 1st Session section, or at least a guide to riffing of chargen into the initial situation / playset. This was vital to running AW effectively and I can see it being no different as to when you wish to play Tremulus in a pickup 'n play format, establishing hazards and linchpins and themes all on the fly. There is the hint of the concept of a first session though: <i>'If anything, you\u2019ll be energized, as will your group, to put together the playset, select playbooks, and then jump into a game in a surprisingly short amount of time. After you\u2019ve completed the first session, you can then properly formalize the frameworks, adding in hazard tracks, creating creatures and the like.</i>' But no real dissemination on the <b><i>how</i></b> of the first session to get to this point.<br/><br/>There needs to be more explanation of keeper (MC) stake questions, how to formulate them given your framework (almost like setting a scene in Durance) and how to set the scenes in play that answer them, I think this is key to playing a 'mystery' on the fly, without a railroaded plot. There is like one paragraph and a promise that 'things will fall into place'. Really? With no guidance on how to go about it?<br/><br/>I'm playing next Friday and I'm pretty pumped. I'll definitely use tokens for hold, and play with no-prep other than a little musing about my home town circa 1920-30 and printing off my moves, principles, player basic moves (including the harm move and purchase move included). Ill get the players to establish their local colour and town lore, then whilst they are working through their playbooks I'll fill in my town worksheet and come up with a few hazard tracks (with any triggers I'm invested in) on the fly and a basic idea of the 'mystery' framework from the locations, NPCs and objects and their various impulses. I have some really cool maps and tourist guides of Katoomba from the time that I'm going to reincorporate the descriptions and locales into play mercilessly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm2468-s1-v.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm2468-s2-v.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394082/#Comment_394082" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-20T11:53:24+00:00" title="October 20, 2012 11:53AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, those local maps and tourist guides from the 20's are super neat, I'll hafta try that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[tremulus] Got my PDF copy! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17369/tremulus-got-my-pdf-copy/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[tremulus] Got my PDF copy! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17369/tremulus-got-my-pdf-copy/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Noofy, that's awesome.

I also agree with you on the presentation of the principles. Hopefully the finished text will flesh out the system more. As it is, I feel like it's presented as an AW hack instead of a full game, and that's part of the reason why.<br/><br/>I actually know someone who picked up tremulus and has no prior knowledge of any apocalypse engine games. I'm really curious what they make of it and what their impression of the system is. AW, DW, and Monsterhearts all delve much deeper into the hows and whys of the system so I'm dying to know if it's necessary or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394120/#Comment_394120" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-20T19:48:14+00:00" title="October 20, 2012  7:48PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2012 9:38PM by mease19.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -I'm in the middle of my first reading but why mention hard moves at all? Why not just refer to them as keeper moves throughout?<br/>-Threaten's examples seem either like empty threats or like they're muddled with take control.  How is using violence different than throwing a punch?  How is wrestling a book from someone's hands different from using violence to get my way?  It doesn't mention having leverage or making a demand up front.  I'm pretty sure that when I say "I lunge at your throat with a dagger" that I'm <i>physically engaging them, with the deadly promise of violence</i>. I'm threatening their life with my dagger.  If I roll a 10+, they can get stabbed like I want or take whatever damage I inflict, right?  What if I say, " I'm going to stab you with my knife?" That's a threat too, same lack of choice on a 10+ - stand there and take it or don't stand there and take it anyway... This should be much clearer.<br/>-There should be more guidance on secrets.  It seems like they should be important and a chance to introduce something cool to the fiction, some intrigue, but people could probably come up with some really unrewarding or bland secrets because they don't want to make their character vulnerable or take it as a blank check to add a crazy self-benefiting facts to the fiction.<br/>-The convince/help miss result of the other player losing trust just doesn't feel right.  I mean it feels right in that it simulates what would happen in real life but doesn't seem like it quite works right mechanically.  What if you're working on building up your trust of someone and they keep botching rolls? Who is it hurting? Alternately, the more I trust you, the easier it is for me to hinder you but the less I trust you, the harder it is to hinder you - that seems an odd dynamic.<br/>-Machetes are pricey.<br/>-I was hoping debilities would be really interesting custom moves rather than +/-1 modifiers.<br/>-I guess I shouldn't read the keeper section cause I'd like to play.  Is it important that I don't? Are there spoilers?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394129/#Comment_394129" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-20T21:44:36+00:00" title="October 20, 2012  9:44PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was a player in a short-ish session of Tremulus today.

That was pretty crucial to getting everything tied together and rolling. So it was maybe an hour into the session before we were acting in character (and if we were planning on playing more than a one-shot, we probably would have spent a lot longer doing first-session type stuff).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394133/#Comment_394133" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-20T22:09:39+00:00" title="October 20, 2012 10:09PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some good observations.

I've been mulling this over all day whilst driving the ambulance and had a sort of mystery epiphany on how I'm going to attempt to run the game sans traditional 'mystery' prep next friday <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I'm right into collaborative play to see what happens yeah? Steve Dempsey's <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/seepagexx/December2007-Steve.html" rel="nofollow">Article</a> on improv investigative horror is a landmark for me, <br/>as is Graham's wonderfully personalised Stealing Cthulhu. <br/><br/>I'm enarmoured with making the whole Keeper takes one hold / Token thing too. So this is my plan:<br/>* Get the players to choose their elements of Colour and Lore and write them on the margins of the map and have one of the players read out the Player's intro blurb for that particular playset whilst I fill out the town worksheet and look up the corresponding framework elements.<br/>* Throw the Playbooks out there and let the players decide on who they want to play, all the while asking provocative questions a la AW/MH/DW chargen, tying the characters to the setting / hazards / and NPCs listed under the playset.<br/><br/>Next I'll follow Graham's advice on playing investigative con games:\n<blockquote><br/>* For the first hour, let them explore a world and interact in character. Exploring is fun. Interacting is fun.<br/>* For the second hour, let them investigate. Now, we're switching to the more traditional sort of fun, which is the players uncovering the GM's mystery.<br/>* In the third hour, hit them with the full horror and let them react to it. Now, we're going back to character interaction. Let party tensions come to the fore. Ideally, they should be turning on each other, restraining each other, pulling guns on each other.<br/><br/>This requires two things: tensions between player characters and a mystery that will knock the character sideways.<br/></blockquote>\nThe tensions between the PC's I will focus on through well versed AW play: Setting up triangles and looking for where they are not in control and pushing there. The mystery will emerge from the elements they are interested in and obvious tragic ends that speak from the hazards and threads developed between them. As clues emerge from play, we write them on the map, infer scenes and further investigations, uncovering the mystery we as a group are most interested  / frightened of discovering out.<br/><br/>The novel thing I'm going to do is have the classic Lovecraftian <b>Endings</b> stolen (as Graham suggests p.21) and written on aged Index Cards in a fancy Handwritten font placed on the table where all can see. Namely:<br/>The Descent<br/>The Final Horror<br/>The Escape (often followed by the Confrontation)<br/>The Realisation<br/><br/>Now here's the cool thing. I don't now as Keeper which of these classic endings I'm going to go with, they all could be wonderfully satisfying, almost as if they are stake questions to be answered. So as the player's make moves and uncover clues and I start asking more provocative questions and turn their moves back on them, or foreshadow future trouble, it will become clearer which direction the mystery is heading. Every time I 'save' a move after a failed Poke Around or Help / Hinder I will take a token and place it on one of the Ending Cards I'm most interested in seeing happen. Conversely, the Players can spend one of their Lore tokens to do exactly the same thing.<br/><br/>That way the play builds collaboratively in a fiasco like way. We know the ending is going to be lovecraftian, but only through the emergent play can we establish as a group the way our mystery will end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394158/#Comment_394158" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T06:06:33+00:00" title="October 21, 2012  6:06AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noofy, that is SUPER cool.

I mean, DW and AW are polar opposites when it comes to executing the first session, but they both recognize the importance of it. Luckily, I've run plenty of CoC games so I'ma just start tremulus like those.<br/><br/>For me that means: give a short synopsis of recent events, a setup of the situation and common-knowledge history of the area. Introduce the characters and establish relationships. I usually have them working together; finding a way to include all the professions in the project. I often use pregens, and the playbooks fit that purpose pretty well. Play begins at the arrival of the town, so the players can start investigations before confronting whatever lurking horror awaits.<br/><br/>My last CoC campaign starred the employees of a real estate firm, sent to a small town to discover why a certain property wasn't selling. Though it was listed in fine condition, no locals were willing to purchase it.

It was a great session and I'll do a full write up after I get some sleep, but I just wanted to get some thoughts down before I go to bed.<br/><br/>Without Graham's<i> Stealing Cthulhu </i>the game would have been half as good. His advice on pacing, aggressive scene framing, reincorporation, beginnings (and endings) and relating the clues to the horror (creature) and increasing the horror need to be paraphrased for the Tremulus ruleset. <br/><br/>The Playset is good, and I tweaked it a little to match our home town of Katoomba, but I found running Hazards listed on the fly a little page-flippy, even after taking 5 to fill out the Town worksheet, the Hazard moves are hard to reference and there needs to be an object category as well as location and hazards. I managed to re-incorporate a book that our salesman had stashed in his 'Caravan of Dreams', that became the nexus of the whole mystery, but still. For a quick Durance style hook, the mystery went down well.<br/><br/>We muddled through the Trust / Hx section with lots of provocative questions, but I think the choices from lists like in DW Bonds, or AW Hx works far better. Folks always elaborate on these lists anyways.<br/><br/>The wealth abstract is a resource without scarcity. Despite using up their wealth as often as possible on missed rolls, it seemed irrelevant to the the greater mystery at hand of elder gods or or contemptuous cult leaders. Just another track to keep.<br/><br/>I found the proliferation of mechanical bonuses and penalties painful when making moves. I pushed for a narrative reason, but it just became too laborious. I quickly fell back into my AW MC style and things made more sense. I didn't ever save hard moves, I simply made them on a miss. There was lots of "yes and...' going on. We simply rolled moves as stated with attribute bonuses, incorporating the playbook moves as narrative justification rather than just +1 this or that. Act under pressure became the go-to move with variations based on different attributes.<br/><br/>Lore was hard to come by, despite players wanting to make Lore moves and attempting to collect it. It was simply another resource to track and not that common a track anyways, plus it was a resource I couldn't easily threaten as a Keeper. So I did away with it as written. The players could make a lore move if they missed a basic move, sort of like a fresh chance.<br/><br/>WE had fun! The props I prepared worked great, as did the framework suggested in the playbook on the player's town choices. I'll post an AP soon, but the players are keen to play next week and see where the mystery leads.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394935/#Comment_394935" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T11:22:13+00:00" title="October 26, 2012 11:22AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's some really good commentary, Noofy.

Christian, Tala and George got right into the 'Ebon Eaves' playset questions, we used our home town of Katoomba in the 20's as the setting. Classic jazz spinning it up on LP and a suitably howling wind shook the house and whistled through the floorboards as we settled in to roleplay the night away.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5102/5738474772_e73da7ca88_z.jpg"/><br/><br/>They came up with [ABE] Signs of the Elders, and [EFG] The Black Grove. And whilst they perused playbooks I jotted down a few notes: The setting wrote itself, as Katoomba's 'Gully' and shanty town (overseen by the Aboriginal Elder and Tracker Billy Lynch) had a dark historical past and instantly became the Nexus of the Gully and the ring of alien stones within. The split personality of the Mi-Go possessed Pastor Brown shepherds his flock of the Inner Starlight, whilst secretly harbouring cult meetings espousing the 'new age thought' and the wonders of modern science in the 'Crimson Order'; a movement with many of the wealthy and intellectual elite of Katoomba involved. Although having no proof, the Country Women's Association is loathe to associate with Pastor Brown and seeks to uncover his dark secret.<br/><br/>Pastor Brown / The Crimson Master and his flock of urchins<br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7058/7025912823_41c5b84b91.jpg"/><br/><br/>Our intrepid investigators (from left to right): The well respected Professor Israel McBain, the sinister Mr. Hank Hale the Antiquarian and proprietor of 'Hale and Shine'. Followed by two undergraduate students that did the Professor's bidding and finally, William 'Biggie' Biggins, Salesman and purveyor of dreams.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5190/5633287557_7bfbfae0a4.jpg"/><br/><br/>Once we started making characters, Christian went straight for the Professor, and as an experienced role-player, dived straight into character during the chargen provocative questioning, developing the portly McBain with aplomb. Tala chose the antiquarian, after musing on the Alienist for a while, but in the end, her portrayal of the duplicitous, laudanum-addicted Hale was spell-binding. George went for the Salesman, and through questioning and some lucky rolls ended up with a vast array of knick-knackery valued well beyond his simple presentation to the world. He called his little sideshow the 'Caravan of Plenty' and assumed the moniker of 'Purveyor of dreams', promising common folk some respite to their downtrodden lives. He also established his possession of an extremely unusual leather bound tome, written in some strange alien script that he hoped Professor McBain may be able to decipher or at least purchase of him.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wFuzMnk5oKE/UA7xh1ELpKI/AAAAAAAADiY/WoP0mdbfRnI/s400/npl+05.jpg"/><br/><br/>I discarded the suggested Nyarlathotep as the mythos entity and went with the Mi-Go instead, identifying them as large vaguely humanoid yabbie like creatures. I opened my STealing Cthulhu to the suggested Mi-Go clues pages and jumped straight in. Biggie rolled into town, strange  buzzing voices giving him a headache and finding a constant trail of urchins chasing his caravan down the street, a bit like gandalf. He asked around searching for McBain and found him ensconced with Hale, deep in the recesses of Hale's shop of misbegotten 'treasures' from various places around the world.<br/><br/>There was a bit of reading people and puzzling things out,  and a dedicated bid for the book as it become of quite some interest to Mcbain, the illustrations inside looking suspiciously like the ring of stones he had heard about down in the Gully.  I made the hard move of taking away Biggie's stuff  / separate them on a missed convince move as the urchins ransacked his caravan out on the main Street and hightailed it down to the Gully. He ended up catching up with them and recovering his knick knacks on a 7-9 Convince, setting up his caravan in the gully and talked to Billy Lynch's wife (an elder), who said that Billy has been missing for days, after hunting for possum skins down near the old kerosene shale mine at the base of Orphan Rock. The concrete assurance right now was for Biggie to go and talk to the few remaining miners and see if they had heard anything about Billy.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, The prof and Hale hatch a plan to procure the book from Biggie through subterfuge or coin, whatever would work, and since Billy was due to bring back some valuable aboriginal 'artefacts' for tourist consumption for Hale, he was keen to discover his whereabouts too. Hale's shop assistant, the lovely miss Shine came down with a splitting headache (foreshadow mythos), and after using the last of McBain's Bex powders, (use up their resources) retired upstairs, causing the two gents to shut up shop and catch the last mining car train down to the ghostly miner's camp in search of both Billy and the elusive Biggins. All three protagonists end up on the same cart, and debate hotly the value of the mysterious book and wonder aloud at the fate of poor Mr. Lynch.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/ksr/images/MountainDevil1936_AManning_250.jpg"/><br/><br/>They found the Pastor preaching to a few destitute miners on the sanctity of the inner light, on a makeshift pulpit, and full of verve. As always he has a few urchins scampering around him with eyes wide with wonder. One of the mineshafts is filled with detritus and large unusual rocks, blocking its entrance. Puzzling this out,  while the other two ask about Billy, the Professor realises that these large rocks are not geologically of this area and the strange alien claw marks gouged into their surface are definitely not of this world. This causes him a little tremor of shock, made worse by the fact he has no Bex to calm himself down. He stumbles back over to the throng, where the good Pastor and a few scruffy miners are being read by Biggie using his salesman move (with Hale helping). The find out that Billy hasn't been seen for days, but one of the miners, a Chinese Immigrant is holding back something. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7640631262_4ddcc1b4b5_m.jpg"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395100/#Comment_395100" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T23:38:06+00:00" title="October 27, 2012 11:38PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ....<br/>As the crowd disperses, and the evening closes is, the consequence of  missing the last coal-car to the top of the cliff and the safety of Katoomba town is emminent. Biggie bales Jimmy Chung up in the sighing gum forest, threatening him with a damn good thrashing. He caves, and says he has to show him what he has found, he can't explain it any other way. Intrigued, Biggie follows, and as the professor notices him slinking off with the cowering chinaman, follows at a discreet distance as they head toward the densely forested base of the Katoomba waterfalls. Hale meanwhile decides on taking the last car to the top imbibing a slug of Laudanum, in the fond hope of rifling through Biggie's caravan to find the book.<br/><br/>Jimmy Chung leads Biggie up the treacherous piles of slippery rocks to the base of the falls, the buzzing headache in his ears becoming ever louder and more intense.

Prof McBain meanwhile, crouched in the spume of the waterfall, sees the pair in the glimmering darkness collecting wetly glistening body parts and flees back to the miner's camp as his shock deepens, desperate to find a guide to take him up the precarious stairway carved into the cliffline, to return home to the safety of his pipe, newspaper and slippers.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5254/5535880351_4f7fd88418.jpg"/><br/><br/>Hale surprisingly acted reasonably under pressure, the Laudanum having the desired effect and managed to locate the strange book in the secret hiding place on Biggie's Caravan of Dreams, and slunk from the gully; unwittingly through the mist-wreathed standing stones, ghostly aboriginal faces taunting him from the gloom.

Did you use those images in play, or find them to illustrate your Actual Play account after the fact?</blockquote>\nAww Thanks, Paul! <br/>Nope, I used all those images in play. I knew we were going to base the Ebon Eaves Playset in Katoomba, so prior to play I scoured our Local Library's Flickr feed and downloaded all the 1920's 30's images and when we needed an image one of us chose the image that fit the scene. It worked a treat!\n<blockquote><br/>Can you tell us more about how the rules and procedures of play helped create those events in play? (I'm not talking about minute-to-minute moves and rolls, but rather the larger scope of backstory, connections, mysteries, etc.)</blockquote>\nSure, I played pretty much as I do most *World games, except the playset creation specified the mystery from the get go. I had to work pretty hard with provocative questioning to get links bewteen the player characters during chargen, but the suggested 'connections' in the newly ammended rules sparked a little conversation. <br/><br/>I found making a relationship map with stickies essential. Every character named through play got added to the map and a connection drawn between at <i><b>least</b></i> one other character and the connection labelled as a <b><i>tag</i></b>. This drove the tension for scenes. I looked for where the player's were not in control and pushed there. I framed many of them, but the players asked for specific scenes too. As long as it increased the tension as Graham suggests in his book, I was down. Even colour scenes without a charged situation (ie: a move) became drivers of the increasing horror fiction.<br/><br/>The move snowball worked predictably well (like it always does). I just had my NPCs follow their instincts and have simple desires. I never 'held' hard moves, I just used them like I normally do, and found the list of specific threat moves handy, though hard to reference on the fly. (I prepped nothing from the playset regarding threats or tracks).<br/><br/>I embraced 'Yes and...' wholeheartedly. This prevented any blocked clues or dead end scenes. We re-incorporated as often as we could. That's why the book (an innocuous mention on Geroge's chargen) became a key motivator. The 'mystery' involved the Mi-Go, the Pastor, The Country Women's Association, The gully with its ring of stones amongst the shanty town and the nefarious book. I have no idea how the mystery will pan out, other than the motivations I chose for my antagonists. I know the Mi-Go want to enslave folks and put their brains in jars. That Pastor Brown is a nutter and wants both salvation for the town and yet his split personality needs to feed the Mi-Go what they want. The CWA wants to show the Pastor for the true duplicitous heathen they fear him to be and the Elders of the aboriginal tribe want the 'bad spirits' exorcised from their traditional hunting grounds.<br/><br/>I found that Graham's Stealing Cthulhu is essential reading for running tremulus (for me). It mapped out the Lovecraftian expectations of story that I was searching for to give some structure to our play to see what happens. The tremulus ruleset is great, the playbooks (as usual in *world games) set the tone and give structure to the protagonists, but the 'how to' of taking the elements given through chargen and the playset creation and developing a mystery and identifying clues from these elements came through Graham.<br/><br/>Hope that helps?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395255/#Comment_395255" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T08:37:50+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  8:37AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic!<br/><br/>Can you tell us more about the specifics of using and developing those "elements"?

Mind you, that interpretation was HEAVILY influenced by <b><i>Stealing Cthulhu</i></b>. Then we just re-incorporated like mad. I just threw the PC's and an element together in a scene, had my NPCs follow their body parts around and steadily increased the horror. The Move snowball helped enormously here too, especially with ramping up the pacing.<br/><br/>An example? Sure. What about the beginning? Biggie had this book, we questioned him about it and I asked him what he wanted to do. He said he wanted to go to Hale's shop and feel him out to see if he was interested. The buzzing came from the Mi-Go as a clue to the impending horror. The professor said  he was always hanging out at Hale's shop, so we had a charged scene just like that. The urchins came from the photo of the Pastor that we chose from the collection and they took on a collective mind of their own, I wonder about them. One of my stakes questions is 'are the urchins followers of the Starlit Church or the Crimson Robe?'. That first scene provided all sorts of questions (or leads) that the players had and wanted to investigate. So we just called for scenes and framed them hard. It was awesome.\n<blockquote><br/>Does that mean that you had just those five elements to work with, or were there other clues/information/constraints? And which came from tremulus, which from Graham's book?</blockquote>\nOh I had more, there is always more. Whatever the players latch onto I guess. The elements from tremulus were from the playset. Namely: The Pastor, the Black Grove and the stones (which neatly morphed into Katoomba's historical Gully), a women's club (which we decided would be the quintessential Australian Country Women's Association) and a cult following a warped progenitor. I replaced the creature as Mi-Go cause I like brains in jars, but otherwise Stealing Cthulhu provided 'portents' or 'clues' in the form of the incessant buzzing, the crustacean corpse, the worshiping horde and the missing Billy Lynch. There are more to come. Its not so much about the players finding these clues, as the inferences they make from them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395354/#Comment_395354" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T03:59:37+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  3:59AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            U_U wow!!!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395401/#Comment_395401" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T11:40:37+00:00" title="October 30, 2012 11:40AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I feel for the tremulus guys.

Eaves material says that the investigators have been "lured" to the town, which suggests that they aren't "residents" per se. But since characters can have shops, chapels, etc, that suggests that they have at least some <i>connection</i> to the town. How should that kind of stuff be established? Would the character be assumed to be a recent arrival, as a resident?<br/><br/>I noticed that the Antiquarian had a shop in your game, Noofy - how did you guys establish that, as part of the character's relationship with the town?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395567/#Comment_395567" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T09:03:08+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  9:03AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2012 9:04AM by 3Jane.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in the middle of running the example scenario released for tremulus, "The Primrose Path".

I've played my fair share of Cthulhu games of various systems, but only played a couple games of <i><b>tremulus</b></i>, and one of<i><b> DungeonWorld</b></i>. So my experience is limited with these<i><b> *World </b></i>hacks. <br/><br/><b>Graham </b>commented before that he believed that tremulus was not a storytelling game, but when questioned further, no one really seemed to have a follow-up answer for the belief that tremulus wasn't a "true" storytelling game, that elements were missing or something. I've now read all of tremulus, and ApocalypseWorld, as well as the Dark World lovecraftian hack on <i>www.thievesoftime.com</i> ... I don't see any difference, and it sure seemed like we were creating a story at the table when I played tremulus<br/><br/>Can someone with more experience point out the differences? or is this just a difference of opinion between two game designers (graham &amp; sean) who both had their own take on things?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396393/#Comment_396393" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T11:47:07+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 11:47AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey man! Glad you found my advice helpful. About your question: I think it all depends on your definition. What is a storygame, anyway? In tremulus, stats determine narrative control rather than than just character ability, which is a sign to me that it's putting story before simulation. Fits my criteria, so I consider it storygaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396407/#Comment_396407" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T12:32:54+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 12:32PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Especially when Graham made that comment, the ruleset hadn't yet changed the Golden Rule to reflect Fiction First. It was still of the mindset that you choose to make rolls to determine what happens, rather than make fictional actions that trigger rolls. That's changed now, which absolutely mitigates that a bit in my mind.<br/>You ARE creating a story as you play, but the same could be said of pretty much any RPG. It's whether the rules are focused on the storytelling rather than other aspects, such as mechanical mastery or such, as I understand it.<br/>I would also argue that Dungeon World is also a touch more traditional in the way it plays than AW, but that's purely personal experience speaking.<br/><br/>I almost feel like the tendency of *World games to fall to the "story-telling side" or more to the "traditional" side seems to coincide with the way stats are worded. As Sage mentioned on the Indie+ panel last week, DW's stats are more akin to a measurement of your capabilities and skills, while AW's stats are more about who you are. tremulus's stats fall on the same side as DW, Monsterhearts's fall on the same side as AW, and that approximately lines up with how I feel about how they fall on the trad/story scale. I'm not saying this is a great determinator, but I thought I'd mention it as a trend I kinda see.<br/><br/>But seriously, as Scrape said, it's a definition thing in the end over What Is A Story Game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/straygeologist" title="straygeologist"><img alt="straygeologist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/straygeologist">straygeologist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396567/#Comment_396567" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T08:36:17+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  8:36AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 8:37AM by straygeologist.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thats a fair view, thanks for you input. Looking at <b>Dark Worl</b>d, Graham's hack displays mechanics that really reinforce the Purist style that he has clearly mastered, while I think the<b> tremulus</b> is a bit more broad, allowing for a pulpier (and perhaps less despairing) view of Lovecraftian fiction. This is the "difference of opinion" i was referring to. Purist vs Pulp is not a new discussion for Cthulhu gaming, but folks are a lot more aware of mechanics reinforcing the Tone of a game, especially in the case of storytelling games. <br/><br/>I kinda dig the idea of "Insanity Moves" in DarkWorld, might be a good house-rule for tremulus if folks are looking to explore that despair. <br/><br/>I see three play-styles with tremulus being presented, as far as I can tell. (1) Follows the Playsets, where players answer questions to define aspects of Ebon Eaves (and future playsets). These are so neat that I can barely stand it. (2) Would be where the Keeper creates a Framework (like Primrose Path) and presents it to a group as a one-shot or CON game. (3) Would be the style of gameplay that ApocalypseWorld suggests, where players &amp; GM collaborate on the world that the players exist and act in. Perhaps the lack of discussion on this third game style is what people feel is missing? <br/><br/>I'm greatly encouraged by the fact that tremulus is not 100% done, and Sean continues to take feedback and make updates to the KS Edition, to clarify mechanics and expand on his intentions. He just released another update this morning which I'll have to check out.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397778/#Comment_397778" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T16:13:44+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  4:13PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally had time to read the Tremulous pdf \u2014 it's been a busy Oct/Nov.

For something that is supposed to be special it should a have a lot more narrative impact. Especially considering that it is a AW-like game in which the players already have a lot of narrative impact. The Antiquarian's Lore move was in my opinion one of the lamer ones considering all it was as Straygeologist mentioned is a "free 10+ to PUZZLE OUT an object."<br/><br/>To make it more interesting maybe it would be great to give the players the ability to create Lore or new plot points. For instance, maybe the Antiquarian's Lore move could be to have a new object of the player's own devising become part of the plot. Of course once the new object is created the MC can do with it what they want.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398071/#Comment_398071" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T08:29:56+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  8:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Antiquarian's move at least is a guaranteed "guys, I know all about this artifact!"

I really appreciated that the folks at RealityBlurs wanted to give all the Kickstater Backers something tangible soon after the KS finished, but at the same time, it feels like all the backers have really been given an <b>extended Beta Test</b>. There's already been about 10 to 15 new pages of materials and clarifications since the first release. How much more will we see before the final print rolls out?<br/><br/>I know that Sean keeps an eye on these forums. Perhaps there is something they can do address the underwhelming reaction to Lore Moves. <br/><b><br/>On the Antiquarian. </b>Essentially, if they nail a PUZZLE OUT roll, and get a 10+, they can gain 1 Lore. That 1 Lore can be used to... get a free 10+ on an object Puzzle Out. So really, its not a special move, its a held action until the player wants info on the Artifact. Meanwhile the ability of the Antiquarians Shop (Special Move) is totally awesome, and gives the player a lot of entitled narrative. This Special Move is potentially way cooler than his Lore Move, and having played this Playbook twice now, I can confirm this.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398131/#Comment_398131" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T18:30:27+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  6:30PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2012 6:32PM by Colinaut.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a related note, Timo of the Jank Cast podcast had similar issues about being inspired with the moves in Tremulus.
