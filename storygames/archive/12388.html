You play the adventure and have a great time. And I mean that, I've had plenty of fun playing GURPS Traveller. The characters have skills and stats, you decide on their races, motivations (which is partly influenced by what the adventure is). Loren Wiseman probably had no idea what kind of game you played.<br/><br/>When you play Poison'd, you make some Pirates. They have lists of which sins they have committed, they start in media res with a dead captain. You're playing very much the kind of Pirates imagined by Vincent Baker. And Poison'd is a great game too, but possibly for different reasons.<br/><br/>Obviously these two games are at the extreme but there is much more of a tendency with Indie games, it seems to me, to push the creative impetus of the designer much further in the game than in traditional games.<br/><br/>I wondered if this is perhaps something which might affect the sales of games, in that those which have less strictures on the creative framework of the game might sell more because they can offer a wider set of experiences to gamers.<br/><br/>What do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277956/#Comment_277956" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T18:54:48+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  6:54PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2010 6:55PM by Elizabeth.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I think the divide in game type is more of a direct reflection of a divide in player type. I spend a lot of my time\u2014 too much, maybe\u2014 talking with hardcore indie gamers about all manner of games, traditional and indie. And the one complaint I'm sure to hear is "there's no guidance for what you're supposed to do here." Like, the GM can write an adventure, but a lot of people who want to GM flounder when the options are too vast. The good thing about tightly-visioned games is that everyone's immediately on the same page, there's a limit to what is sensical to do, and no one's paralyzed by choice or uncertainty.<br/><br/>So, I mean, I think the question is really "Are there more players who enjoy broad structures than who enjoy tightly-curated situations?" For me, I don't care either way; I don't like to GM, so it doesn't matter to me who has created the structures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277957/#Comment_277957" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T19:20:14+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  7:20PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I back Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Before I ever came across The Forge I have always been deeply concerned with playing the game "correctly".  Since a lot of RPG texts didn't tell me I would spend HOURS and HOURS trying to guess at the intention behind certain rules.  I would study the format of example scenarios trying to deduce their underlying principles and copy their format and structure as precisely as I could manage. <br/><br/>Why did I do that? Because that's simply how other kinds of games are played.  In other kinds of games you make choices within the rules of the game but the structural format and focus of Chess remains the same every time.  I entered the hobby in total isolation.  My mother picked up a copy of Red Box D&amp;D at Toy's 'R' Us when I was 8 and didn't have anyone else in the hobby to talk to AT ALL.  You can master Chess by perfecting your precise understanding and application of the rules.  I wanted to master D&amp;D in the exact same manner.<br/><br/>In fact when I moved on to AD&amp;D in Jr. High/High School I didn't realize that things like "The Wilderness Survival Guide" were meant to be modular kits that you used as your own game demanded.  Since the blue "Expert Set" was meant to be added on to the red "Basic Set" I assumed that all the books in the AD&amp;D line worked the same way.  I assumed that the "full" game of D&amp;D was SO HUGE you had to release it and learn it in volumes.<br/><br/>The problem was this began to get overwhelming and confusing.  There were rules in one book I couldn't figure out how you were supposed to use them simultaneously with rules from some of the other books.  I felt deep shame when as a GM I didn't feel like dealing with all the wilderness stuff between town and the dungeon and "skipped it."  I felt like I was cheating.  I wasn't "good enough" to play the WHOLE game.<br/><br/>Eventually, I figured out how it "really" was supposed to work.  Frankly that was a profound disappointment.  The reason being that I don't want to be a game designer.  I don't want have to worry that my selection of rule choices and so forth are the "right" choices.  I want all those choices and decisions made for me so that I can just relax and play the game.  Like I would chess.<br/><br/>I was pretty much on the verge of quitting the hobby over this very fact when I encountered The Forge.  The idea that, no really, a game can be about one thing and have all the rules work in concert together to do that one thing well was literally a life saver for me.  FINALLY, a game I could "just play."  A game that delivered what it promised when you just followed the rules.<br/><br/>Will the other type of game generate more sales?  Maybe.  It will actively LOSE my sale.  I also think I"m not alone.  What I do think is that I'm stubborn and curious.  I think a lot of the people LIKE me were driven out of the hobby upon first contact with it.  I think there's a HUGE potential customer base "out there" that had their first game been My Life with Master instead of Traveler they'd still be in the hobby.<br/><br/>I wish I could find them.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277961/#Comment_277961" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T19:57:15+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  7:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Steve,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I wondered if this is perhaps something which might affect the sales of games, in that those which have less strictures on the creative framework of the game might sell more because they can offer a wider set of experiences to gamers.</blockquote>\nBoard game players play and buy lots of games. And with board games the hand of the designer is strong and present. They get their wider set of experience not by playing one loose, open game, but by playing widely across many strongly designed games.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277989/#Comment_277989" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T23:51:30+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 11:51PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not sure on the sales, so I will leave that aside for a bit.<br/><br/>The Israeli culture, especially the con-going one, is not too keen on following mechanics. They like "just playing", or when there's a conflict just rolling some dice and the GM telling them what it means (at least this is how it was several years ago). An Israeli I know tried to run Polaris, but the players felt collared by the mechanics, like they weren't giving them enough freedom.<br/><br/>Now, should we assume that had they played the game amongst themselves, they may have ended up house-ruling it, or just drifting it as they play so they engage the mechanics less and less. This is more likely with games that encourage long-form gaming because there's more time to play them and gradually drift them over.<br/>In a game like Vampire: the Masquerade, you play what the designers envisioned as possible both when you play diplomatic games and when you play fighty games. They may not be capable of envisioning all the concrete cases, but should we reduce the types of games/actions, there are going to be fits.<br/><br/>However, if you drift Poison'd, or play Polaris without ritual phrases, I think you've drifted the game much farther from the designer's planned-space than you could ever do with a "sandbox" game.<br/><br/>Now, I thought of Paul's remark, and while I think the reason is relatively simple, it also lead me to an interesting thought:<br/>Board gamers can play all those games because you can pick up a board game and in many cases, be playing 20-30 minutes later, knowing 95% of the rules.<br/>RPGs don't do this. Now, let me clarify and be stricter: If after you read the whole book (over 2+ hours) you can teach others the rules in 20 minutes? It doesn't cut it. You need to be able to run the game in 30 minutes from pick up, and that's still borderline. It's best if you can explain the rules for 5 minutes, begin playing, and after 10-15 minutes of explaining the rest of the rules as you play it's "all there".<br/><br/>Thought: We often put appendices in games with the game's order and mechanics. It may be interesting to make <i>that</i> what comes first, and then the "appendix" is the rules at length. Of course, it may work better with a rule, paragraph to explain it, etc., then all the game-text at length, then on the back-cover a one page with the procedures alone, without even the one paragraph. Might be interesting to try.<br/><br/>The other thought on board-gamers versus gamers stems from the above. Players spend so much time learning a rule-set, and there's so much to do, that they might rather play "game 1" within one system, and then play "game 2" in the same system, perhaps even with the same characters. An exploration of new worlds Traveler game, a diplomatic Traveler game, a military campaign Traveler game...<br/>1. They don't <i>need</i> to move to a different system to play those "other" games, so instead of picking 5 games that do those 5 things, they pick 1 and do all of those.<br/>2. They are actively moved against trying different systems when one will do, for the humongous time expenditure. Not just of learning the rules, but how long it takes to "finish" a game. The whole concept of "You need 10-20 sessions, 3-4 hours per". Let me tell you, that board game which takes 6-10 hours to play (Twilight Imperium?) is rarely broken out. So you're going to spend all that time on all those games? You won't take out several.<br/>And for those indie games with their one shots? Well, it might work better with people "outside", but most gamers I know outside of the indie community are all for campaigns, with a one-shot here and there being the most they're willing to. I think the length of time, the investment required to learn, and then master, a system are key here; both to abandon a system you've mastered (also edition wars), and to pick up a new one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278010/#Comment_278010" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T06:17:10+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  6:17AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>The Israeli culture, especially the con-going one, is not too keen on following mechanics.

My gut says Elizabeth is right and this is an issue of player preference, with some people who prefer things to be focused and guided and others who prefer to create their own focus and guide themselves, but I couldn't even begin to guess how many of one or the other there are.<br/><br/>Case in point:  I had a similar childhood to Jesse, in that I got a copy of the D&amp;D rulebook before I ever found anyone else who played it.  I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about what the intent of those rules were, trying to figure out what a game played by those rules would be like.  I figured, hey, it works for Monopoly and Sorry and Go Fish, it has to work for D&amp;D, too.<br/><br/>Where our experiences differ is that when I did finally start playing, it was in a group where most of the people had been playing for years.  There were lots of GMs and lots of campaigns going on concurrently: basically, if Dave didn't feel like running his D&amp;D game that week, we'd play Steve's D&amp;D game instead.  And what was the eye-opener for me was that Dave's game was similar but not identical to Steve's, even though it was all the same people who were involved.  They obviously took some cues from each other, but they didn't want to run exactly the same game and so they didn't.  Sometimes a GM would test out a house rule in his own campaign, and if it worked, other people would adopt it.  Sometimes a GM would say "I'm sick of Greyhawk, I think I'm going to run a D&amp;D game set in post-apocalyptic Australia!" and everyone else would pitch in ideas for how that might work and what specific changes you could make to Mad-Max-ify D&amp;D.<br/><br/>And that's when the game actually clicked for me, in a way that it never did when it was just me reading the rulebook alone and imagining the Perfectly Accurate D&amp;D Session.  It wasn't Chess, which I could play against a computer if I really wanted to (and sometimes did).  No, it was Cowboys and Indians: you get a bunch of your friends together and have fun imagining crazy adventures and working out ways to avoid the "I shot you!"/"Nuh-uh!" arguments.  The rules were a tool, and a way to manage the social interactions, and a fun nerdy thing to talk about, and probably a few other things, too.  They weren't perfect, and while we would constantly try to make them more perfect, we all knew that job would never be finished.  And where that crazy design-your-own ethos nearly drove Jesse out of the hobby, it totally sucked me further into it, in a way that more rigid, tightly focused games might not have.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there's room for both types of games to exist.  I figure designers are going to make the games they love rather than try to make a game they hate but think everyone else will love, so as long as there are different opinions about what makes a good game, we should continue to see plenty of variety.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278012/#Comment_278012" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T07:21:48+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  7:21AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience matches Guy's above. I think he makes amazing points here. And I agree with Paul about boardgames. <br/><br/>To bring Guy and Paul's ideas together, I know 2 high up admins at boardgamegeek who go to a lot of boardgame cons (and are former RPG players) and they've had similar observations as Guy. <br/><br/>Regardless how big the rule book is, many people want to start playing in 15-30 minutes. Which means they will absorb that much rules information and start if they think they can wing the rest or quit if they can't. And the more similar the game seems to be to their past experiences, the more assumptions they will make about how you play. <br/><br/>This is why exception based design is so successful. I can teach you Dominion's basic rules in 3 minutes...<br/><br/>- Win by having the most Victory Points when the game ends.<br/>- Gain Victory Points by buying Victory cards.<br/>- Buy cards with Money cards.<br/>- There are piles of cards on the table you can buy.<br/>- All the cards in a single pile are the same.<br/>- There are 3 types of cards: Money, Victory, and Actions.<br/>- Each card says...<br/>--&gt; How much it cost to buy.<br/>--&gt; How many Victory Points it is worth.<br/>--&gt; What new Action it lets you take.<br/>- The game ends when...<br/>--&gt; 3 piles of cards are sold out.<br/>--&gt; Or the six point Victory card pile is sold out.<br/>- Start the game with 3 one point Victory cards and 7 one Money cards.<br/>- Shuffle your cards and place them face down.<br/>- Draw 5 cards.<br/>- On your turn, with those cards you can...<br/>--&gt; Play 1 Action card in your hand.<br/>--&gt; Buy 1 card on the table.<br/>- Everything you play, don't play, can't play, and buy goes into your discard deck.<br/>- When you run out of cards, shuffle your discard deck.<br/>- Action cards let you...<br/>--&gt; Draw more cards.<br/>--&gt; Play more Action cards.<br/>--&gt; Buy more cards.<br/>--&gt; Buy cards at a discount.<br/>--&gt; Trash cards you don't need anymore.<br/>--&gt; And a lot more!<br/><br/>Every Action card says what it does on the card, just read the card and now you know everything you need!<br/><br/>Bigger doesn't equal better! If your deck is too big, it takes longer to draw your valuable cards! It can be a great idea to use Action cards that let you trash cards to get rid of your low value cards. Even trashing the one point Money and Victory Cards you started with can help you win! Action cards that let you draw more cards and play more cards are also very useful for going through your deck quickly. Which is especially helpful because although Victory cards are needed to win the game at the end... during the game they just take up space in your deck! <br/><br/>Less than 3 minutes with strategy tips throw in! <br/><br/>The cards themselves help remind you how to play. And since you have goals (winning) you have something to measure to give you feedback on how well you are doing and what you may need to change to do better. Ultimately... the easier it is to play, the easier it is to share with your friends and the easier it is for them to share it with new people!<br/><br/>Back to the thread's first post... I think an open gaming experience allows for increased sales in the existing RPG community. But if sales are the main concern, open games aren't the only criteria. Science Fiction games tends to sell less than 50% of Fantasy games to the existing RPG community. So in addition to restricting the structure of your game, you will probably also start having to restrict the content if maximizing sales is the goal. <br/><br/>For the boardgame community... a tighter game is more valuable and easier to teach and share. Technically GURPS is easy to teach if the GM is doing most of the work. But then it because hard to share since only 1 person, the GM knows how to play and bring the experience to new people.<br/><br/>Fan fiction and play by post communities are even bigger than the boardgame community. And they require even less structure than GURPS!

Of course, I've been <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/fluency-play/" rel="nofollow">nattering on about this</a> for some time now, so I WOULD think so. In fact, I just wrote a whole passionate screed on it that I decided was a wee bit off the topic (or at least a bit <i>dominating</i> of the topic), so I shunted it off into <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12393&amp;page=1#Comment_278047" rel="nofollow">its own thread</a>.<br/><br/>Here, suffice to say that yes, this is my preferred method of transmitting all rules ever, that even for simple rulesets I find it <i>more</i> work to explain it all up-front because people inevitably need it repeated, and I designed <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12245&amp;page=1#Comment_274645" rel="nofollow">The Dreaming Crucible</a> so you open the booklet, get materials together, and start playing right away, learning new rules and game phases as you go.<br/><br/>Now, as it relates to the rest of the topic, this is important to me because yes, if you have to invest a huge chunk of time, energy and brainspace to learning this immense clockwork of a game, of COURSE you're going to be motivated by that investment to use that one game for everything, always. So the way to combat that is not JUST to designed focused rules engines that do the ONE thing better than GURPS or whatnot does the ANYthing, but also to make the engines streamlined and easy to learn and use, so that switching around and learning new game-skillsets is painless and even (dare I say) <i>fun.</i><br/><br/>It should be no surprise that this intersects with my interest in microgame design. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278055/#Comment_278055" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T12:32:09+00:00" title="June 26, 2010 12:32PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2010 12:39PM by Thunder_God.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: Off-topic, better in the other thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278062/#Comment_278062" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T13:29:13+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  1:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going back to the original post, I have to disagree to an extent that the creative impetus of the designer is more in the fore in Indie games. Traditional games typically come with a rigid, well-defined setting that showcases the designer's vision. A great many Indie games have no setting whatsoever, and some (Ganakagok, Disapora) provide rules and guidelines that allow (or better yet, enable) the players and GM to all have input into the world in which the game is set, amongst other things. In such a game, the designer provides merely a framework upon which the players will ultimately hang their own variation on his theme.<br/><br/>There are many, many types of Indie RPG, and the word Indie itself means different things to different people.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278077/#Comment_278077" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T14:58:04+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  2:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2010 8:42PM by droog.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'whose'<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure there's some element of gamer conservatism that comes in here. I remember being struck, back in the 90s before I'd ever heard of indie games etc, by the fact that for many people the RPG experience was essentially unitary. They expected that each game would be more or less the same, with perhaps some differences in task res and of course the setting.<br/><br/>"Let's do some RPing!"<br/>"Could we do this in more of an RP way?"<br/>"Let's make up some chrs."<br/><br/>Now my response to this was to start pushing as hard as possible for different experiences with each new game/campaign (so I was primed for the indie stuff when I found it, btw).

It doesn't mean that because it is 100% the players game, nothing else maters.

And if you want an open game to hack, there is plenty of free ones you can download right now. So why should someone buy your game? The answer will probably affect who buys it. <br/><br/>And this is true for boardgames and any game from scrabble to football. It's not specific to RPGs. <br/><br/>It's just that the culture around RPGs tends to promote hacking. <br/><br/>Just because many people who play RPGs and RPG cultures do this... doesn't mean your players will.

But that is not the<b>only</b>way people play, no matter how many times you insist it.</blockquote>\nIt is the only thing that makes roleplaying roleplaying.<br/><br/>The first time anyone at any of those tables announced an action that wasn't directly reading from your text, they were modifying what you did, extending it, trampling on it, destroying it. If you went outside and shot yourself - as you would have been moved to if you had seen me, the worst and stupidest player of all time at one of those tables - the game would have continued. <br/><br/>They had to modify what you wrote in order to play. Without doing this, they couldn't play. If you watched them play, you watched them modify what you wrote.<br/><br/>Whether you said in your work this is okay, or whether you said "Don't you dare use any kind of Rule Zero on this game!" in 30 point font at the top of every page is really not relevant. To play they had to customize. They had to make a character, for example. Or if they didn't, if they had pregenerated characters, they had to announce an action for a character. The only way this isn't customization is if you listed every possible action for every possible character and what the consequences would be.

The text will affect the final outcome to some degree, and this is determined by the group. Designer's intent is a separate but related issue.<br/><br/>Let's say I'm playing AD&amp;D, 1st ed. At some point I decide that the rules for weapon vs armour class are just too much trouble, and I stop using them. At this point, I'm departing from the rules as written and, yes, customizing my play to some extent. But if I'm using every other rule in the extensive combat system, it's a relatively small change. I'm still playing what, for most people, is AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>There's a rumour around that Gygax himself didn't use those weapon vs armour modifiers, so whether I'm fulfilling the designer's intent or subverting it is a question.<br/><br/>All this is related to other issues such as the size of the text as well as its clarity and internal consistency.

The only place we differ is whether we put a "mere" in front of tools, and even I won't split hairs that fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278456/#Comment_278456" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T00:52:15+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 12:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we're moving away from the original point which was not about the extent to which players customise the rules but rather the extent to which the design intent of the rules is to create a more constrain type of play. In AD&amp;D it's wide open, there is hardly anything about what the players do. In Apocalypse World, there is a lot about how the GM directs play and what the players do. <br/><br/>It was my contention that indie games tend towards a more focussed gaming experience than mainstream games, constraining the GM, the players, the tone or the setting more frequently and to a greater extent than mainstream games.<br/><br/>I imagine that if I went through my large collection of games and compared between indie and mainstream games in different genres then on the whole, the indie games are more focussed. In fact, I'm sure. That's not to say that you couldn't, for example, use My Life with Master rules to play a Traveller like game, but that's not the design intent. Whereas one might easily play a My Life with Master like game using Traveller rules without breaking the design intent of Traveller.<br/><br/>So the point about which I'm less sure is whether games with wider focus, which could potentially appeal to a wider range of games, might sell more. I'm much less sure about this because there are many variables that come into play not least being the age of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278743/#Comment_278743" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T09:06:19+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  9:06AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/><br/>I'm not sure I agree. I know that one of the big things that got me excited about indie games in the first place was the wide open range of possibility they embodied. Either because they actually allowed you to do things you couldn't before, or, sometimes, simply because they made it easier. My own, subjective, experience has been the opposite of yours.<br/><br/>I was drawn to RPGs because of their wide scope: "You can do anything!"<br/><br/>But whenever we actually played, it never felt like that was quite true, or at least not as easy as it sounded. Playing D&amp;D, pretty much everyone I know at some point or other wanted to play a Gandalf-type character. But, no, you couldn't do that: wizards aren't allowed to use swords. What about playing something like your favourite new fantasy novel? Well, no, doesn't work: wizards forget spells after they cast them, so we can't emulate the type of magic in that story. <br/><br/>Or maybe there's no way to recreate a type of plot you enjoyed, like where the heroes are captured by the Duke's guards and thrown in prison and then escape. Because, first of all, the Duke's guards can't even roll well enough to harm the heroes--but if the heroes allowed themselves to be captured, none of them have a "lockpicking" skill (or whatever), and no one can get out of the cell. <br/><br/>And that's without wondering whether we could move into a modern-day game or a science-fiction game. Or a political intrigue game: my character concept is a smart, knowledgeable young princess who uses her sex appeal to manipulate the court. And has zero combat experience. Can't even make a character like that in D&amp;D, even though it's totally "in-genre".<br/><br/>I remember wanting to play out a game about a priest's spiritual struggles with his own faith. And all the games we had totally let us down--they wouldn't support us, but rather undermined us every step of the way. <br/><br/>But games like the Solar System, Universalis, The Pool, It's Complicated, Polaris, Fiasco, Otherkind dice, In a Wicked Age..., etc, opened the door to completely different types of play, and could be made to work in any kind of setting, any universe, and still support us as we played. Playing a wizard who wields a sword is no trouble at all in The Pool, is it? <br/><br/>General conflict resolution mechanics broaden the scope of stories you can meaningfully play through and address--it's easier to figure out how to resolve a car chase using Dogs in the Vineyard mechanics than D&amp;D mechanics, even though neither is designed to "do" car chases.<br/><br/>Just my two cents--I don't think what you're saying is a given at all. My experience of the "trad/indie" division was the opposite: less limiting, more open, more adaptable to different settings, to different types of fiction, to different materials for play.<br/><br/>Yeah, we could try to do a car chase with D&amp;D rules. But it was hard work, and often unfulfilling, unless we pretty much went and designed our own rules for doing so. Same for making a character who just isn't about combat. Or even a character who is, like an Inigo Montoya--who follows the constraints of good fiction and character motivation instead of the rules of dungeon crawling and is only concerned with the odds of survival.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278859/#Comment_278859" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T16:43:34+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  4:43PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd put it slightly differently, Paul, and it gets back to what I was saying: it's not that the traditional game is limiting, it's that all traditional games play in more or less the same way. This is a consequence of traditional games essentially consisting of a chrgen+task res system+GM.<br/><br/>The articulated conservative position, interestingly, is consciously against the idea of genre emulation (I'd reference some threads at the RPGSite, but I'm too lazy).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278867/#Comment_278867" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T17:29:06+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  5:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always held up Universalis as a good example of a fully indie-style "generic" game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
