I love it!<br/><br/>But I noticed something.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter what kind of game you play, the build-up is pretty much the same if you're playing GM-less games with the same people over and over again. It's the same kind of drama with different characters in a different environment. But I remember when I played Archipelago (GM-less) with some other folks and it was an amazing session, but I wasn't that sure if it was thanks to the game or the gaming group. The structure for how we prepared the game, framed scenes and used the rules was similar. So yes, both groups understood the game.<br/><br/>Now follow me on this thought.<br/><br/>In traditional games with a GM, people usually say that it doesn't really matter what the game is; if the GM is good, it will result in good sessions. And of course, it's the other way around as well. The thing is that after a while you (read: me) start to predict how the GM is steering the game. You learn the build-up.<br/><br/><i>My reflection is as following:</i> because traditional games with a GM only depends on one person, you can get several different build-ups in a gaming group with several GMs in their own games, even if all the GMs are using the same game.<br/><br/>In GM-less games, it depends more on the group as whole which means that different games will pretty much result in the same stories.<br/><br/><b>GM-less RPGs played with my regular group</b><br/>Archipelago<br/>My Life With Master (sort of GM-less - the players frame their own scenes)<br/>Polaris<br/>Psychodrame<br/>Svart av kval, vit av lust (we've played this a lot)<br/>The Coyotes in Chicago (sort of GM-less - it's one PC played by one player and 3-4 GMs)<br/>While the World Ends<br/>Zombie Cinema<br/><br/>PS. Just a disclaimer: I don't see this as a general problem for all players. The problem lies probably within me, because I tend to notice build-ups. I can't enjoy certain movies for the same reason. "Boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl back" as a simplified description of a build-up for RomComs, for example.

The thing is, most games just assume that all people know the dramatic curve. I would like to have a more structured game <i>during</i> play but I wonder if that's the only solution.<br/><br/>And to be fair: While The World Ends have a certain structure for a build-up. To be able to reach your goal, you must first build relations. We really rushed while playing this game (3-4 hours of play?) and it deserves to be tested again, perhaps over two or three sessions (3-4 hours each). But I would probably enjoy an even tighter structure, like "The relationship that you build must have one of the following - a love connection, an enemy or co-dependency - and you can't reach your goal before you got one of each".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394189/#Comment_394189" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T12:27:46+00:00" title="October 21, 2012 12:27PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to suggest that you try a GM-less game where you just play your characters and don't worry about dramatic arc, and where the starting situation and rules ensure that evolution and escalation will happen through play.
