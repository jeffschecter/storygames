                    OK, that's a little pedantic, but I realized that in writing Grey Ranks I keep saying stuff like "...it is expected that you will incorporate those elements into your narration" without explanation or comment.  <br/><br/>So how would you define narration, as an element of dirty hippie story games?  This is a very simple question, so if you are motivated, please give me your very simple answer.                </div>

Games have always been full of jargon, though.  Pawn, fr'ex.  I don't think that narration is too far off the mark for what you're doing in the game, so it's a good use of jargon.  As opposed to things like, say, Canticle or Monomyth.                        </div>

                            Graham, I feel your pain, and I'm trying to be aware (but not hyper-aware) of it as I write.  <br/><br/>"...it is expected that you will incorporate those elements into your contribution to the story"?<br/><br/>Narration in my specific case is constrained - you have the responsibility to add something and no one else does, so I need a clear and active word or phrase that indicates that.  Or I'll use "narrate" and explain what I mean somewhere.                        </div>

                            This is hard to comment on without the context of the game into which the text will go. But, for instance, looking at the sample sentence, instead write something like:<br/>
<br/>
"Be sure to describe the events surrounding what's happening to the character incorporating these elements into that description."<br/>
<br/>
But, again, that might not work right for some game. Does the game have some section that defines what narration is like or who does what part of the narration? Is there a sample of play? Do you have a glossary where you define jargon that the game must already have? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a tangent, personally I think that clauses like "it is expected" and my similar "be sure to" are actually weak phrasing. They make it seem like there are exceptions to these rules, or that you're only supposed to try. Maybe that's what you intend. But, personally, I prefer rules that are written like law. <br/>
<br/>
"The player must incorporate these elements into his description of the action, or he gets no bonus for them." <br/>
<br/>
Along with a clause somewhere else in the text that says something like, "If there is a question of whether some rule has been satisfied or not, the GM should rule quickly on this, and move play on." Doesn't have to be that rule, but some rule as to who decides when there is a judgment call. I see too many games where the text is simply suggesting technique, doesn't make these things a rule, and relies on hopefulness that the players will never have a difference of opinion as to the interpretation of the rule, instead of having a rule that gives players a way to decide these issues and move on. <br/>
<br/>
That's the "hippie-est" part of these games to me, actually, when the implied rule is "why can't we all just get along?" <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To get back on topic, I think that clauses like the one being discussed are much clearer when they're not couched in "soft" language. If you do use some jargon defined elsewhere in the text, or simply explain well what you mean in a rule on the spot, it'll work better if you simply say "do this, do that" not "try to do X" or "If you can, do Y." <br/>

                            Thanks Mike, that's great advice.  I'm definitely guilty of weak phrasing in The Roach - there are a lot of assumptions without concrete procedures, which some people are OK with leaving up to individual groups to work out, but others can and do struggle with.  <br/><br/>To address your specific questions, in Grey Ranks you must invoke aspects of your character to get dice to roll in conflicts, but I'm reluctant to set up a procedure for deciding when that requirement has been satisfied.  But as a player you have this space in which the spotlight is on you, to shape the story in a certain way based on what you choose to invoke, and I'm currently calling it narration.  <br/><br/>Currently there are lots of examples of play, clear rules about who gets to say stuff when, but no game terminology glossary.  Honestly I really need to find good ways to simplify the words I use so that a glossary is not necessary, because the game *already* has an actual glossary of historical names and terms.                        </div>

<br/>
Jason, do you imagine your target audience including people who do not know that narration = telling a story?  Because I thought you were targeting adults who are interested in telling stories.  And I'm having a hard time imagining that adults who are interested in telling stories won't know exactly what you mean when you tell them what their narration should or must include.<br/>

It's a good word.  I say leave it be.<br/>

                            Hey Graham, if you don't do it you don't get dice and thus fail conflicts and experience trauma.  The only question is what qualifies as "narrating in an aspect", which can't really be quantified.  <br/><br/>***<br/>Group one:<br/><br/>JASON:  OK, I'm tough as nails so Henia is super impressed and we make out.<br/>GRAHAM:  Uh, all right.<br/><br/>Group two:<br/><br/>JASON:  I want this vignette to be about Henia seeing through Janek's hard exterior - these two are going to get more intimate.  Let's see, we're in the cellar of a flat on Jerusalem avenue, total rubble above our heads.  Artillery is pounding and Janek's just sitting by the door with concrete dust in his hair ... Radek is there but he's asleep ... Graham, you play Henia, OK?  What happens?<br/>***<br/><br/>Neither group is playing right or wrong, and in both I'm introducing the aspect "tough as nails".                        </div>

In GR when you choose to invoke some aspect you choose what it is on the fly (you are skinny, you hold your Catholic faith dear, etc) and I want that to be a part of the scene you are framing - part of the narration you provide.

Well, for instance in <i>Capes</i>, you've got a list of powers, right?  And when you use one of these powers you are "supposed to" narrate its importance in the scene.  The mechanics encourage you to use different powers, and so if people follow the guidelines then they get a varied narrative structured around a skeleton of some basic abilities.  Very comic-book.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you decide one time that you just really, really want to use the mechanical effects of "Super Strength," but your narration is all about pouring on the intensity in your eye-beams ... is that really a problem?  It really is not.  I mean ... who cares?<br/>
<br/>
Even if you throw that narration rule entirely out the window, you're not screwing with the mechanical balance of the game.  The game will still work.  You're just throwing away an aid to your own creativity.  That's <i>a shame</i>, but it's not something I feel strongly enough about that I worry that the wording is too weak.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my question would be:  if you're worried that people are going to brush past your recommendation ... is it a problem for the game if they do?  Or is it just them depriving themselves of a creative aid?                        </div>

                            When there's a judgment call, somebody at the table has to be assigned to decide what counts and what does not. Often the GM, but there are other ways to do it. <br>
<br>
I've said this before, but this is actually pretty definitive of tabletop RPGs, that, at some point some participant has to make this sort of judgment call. In other RPGs, it's often "When do we roll?" In others it's "What gives a modifier?" But it's precisely this judgment that leads to the potentially infinite number of situations in a TT RPG, which is something you don't find in many other forms of play. This is what separates them from CRPGs, for instance, where the computer can't make subjective calls, but always has a set of criteria to look at. <br>
<br>
People need to embrace this, and learn where the judgement calls are in their games, and ensure that there are ways to make sure that everyone agrees with the judgments. Even if it's just "GM decides." It's by such a method that the group can develop a community standard for these things. Yes, the standard will be different for each group. But sans the parallel of a court system to establish precedence, and make final rulings, it's only by luck that you'll end up with anything like a community standard. <br>

                            Actually, I agree with Eric. I believe that the average adult--gamer or non-gamer--will understand what "narration" is. Just make sure you explain it the first time you use the term. For example:<br/><br/>"After winning a conflict, you gain the right to narrate the outcome of that conflict...<i>several pages later</i>... when you narrate, you must include X in your description."<br/><br/>When I was writing <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, I was very... <i>worried</i> about using a bunch of jargon. But when I showed the text to my totally non-gamer wife, she looked at me and said, "Why do you keep explaing yourself, everyone knows what that means."<br/><br/>People aren't stupid. Alot of the "jargon" that has come out of the Forge is actually pretty self-explanatory, it's just that gamers are so use to using jargon that non-jargon sounds funny.                        </div>

Marlon Perkins was a narrator long before hippie-game taint.  Narrators have a long and comfy history in literature - hell, the very first novel ever (The Tale of Genji) is told mostly from the point of a narrator.<br/><br/>People understand narration.                        </div>

                            Thanks, guys, especially Kuma for invoking the vengeful spirit of Marlon Perkins.  Like most simple questions this has proven to be more complicated than I anticipated.  <br/><br/>My concern, which I still have, isn't that regular people won't know what narration or a narrator is, but that in the context of the game those words might be used without context.  I'm lazy, it is easy to make careless assumptions, and there's a fine line to walk between cryptic and pedantic.  "Narration" means something different in a game than it does in a novel, there are issues of authority, stance, permission, I don't know what all.<br/><br/>I'll explain it in detail the first time I bring it up.  Again, thanks for the feedback.                        </div>

I understood what you meant.  I let my explination of my own position veer off target.  I still disagree with you.  If you tell someone who's never played an RPG before to narrate something I have every confidence that they will understand what you're telling them.  I don't think there's a big enough difference between the narrative of a novel and the talky-stuff that's expected from RPG players to confuse anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, if that just means we dissagree on that point, that's cool.<br/>

                            Could you post the whole paragraph, or at least the whole sentence? I think I understand what you are turning over, but more context would be good.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>So how would you define narration, as an element of dirty hippie story games?  This is a very simple question, so if you are motivated, please give me your very simple answer.</blockquote>
"Narration in a game is who gets to say what happens in that scene."<br/><br/>Then I might add " It might be one person the whole time, with other people reacting and asking the narrator questions (traditional DM style); or it might be shared around, with multiple people taking turns and trading off as their characters or interests come into play."                        </div>
