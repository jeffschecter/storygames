Here are some <b>goals</b> that I am really keen on accomplishing for the Open Gaming Circle at Gamestorm. I\u2019m pretty new to Story Games and this type of play in general, so help me edit/ expand these. <br/><br/>1. Create a safe space<br/>2. Get new people to relax, and point out that no experience is needed.<br/>3. Give people who aren\u2019t familiar with these types of games a couple of pointers to make play smoother. (Repetition is key, this is just the first time they\u2019ll hear these techniques).<br/>4. Explain that we are going to pitch games and that you can play whatever you want.<br/><br/>Additional goals for the Spiel at the beginning of the Open Gaming Circle at Gamestorm might be:<br/>Have everyone be quiet for a minute as others filter in.<br/>Pep talk.<br/>Show that this is a different thing than the RPG room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372353/#Comment_372353" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T09:06:36+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  9:06AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2012 9:10AM by Ross_Cowman.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to talk about-<br/><br/>We're cooperating<br/>Obvious works<br/>The New Veil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372360/#Comment_372360" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T09:23:46+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  9:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find talking about Veils right up front really intimidating.

Generally, if I know or have a good sense of everyone at the table, or if we're playing a relatively light and fun game, talking about "veils" isn't necessary. I can either trust the players to speak up or I'll just go ahead and -- as game organizer -- veto anything that might be problematic ("Yeah, can we not go there? I would appreciate that. How about something else?") or ask questions before proceeding ("Is everyone's cool with the ratman eating the dude's face?" which happened in our DW game).<br/><br/>For more intense games, talking about "veils" in a general way, in front of a huge crowd of people, isn't really sufficient to create safe space at the individual tables, once people break up into groups and start talking and playing. In some ways, I worry that it creates this illusion of safe space that may or may not actually be there in practice. It's really up to the organizers of individual games to engage with their players and create the kind of social environment that's going to facilitate a positive play experience (or a negative one that at least doesn't abuse people's trust).<br/><br/>Honestly, I'd rather work to develop a culture around "how to safely run games about difficult material" -- based around shared expectations and individual responsibiluty -- and say something about that beforehand, during pitches.  Like, during pitching, say: "This game deals with some difficult material, and we'll talk before play begins about how we're going to handle that. But if you're really uncomfortable with X content, maybe consider playing something else."  More often, though, I find that -- when I run games like that -- I only tell the people I'm interested in playing that game with and it isn't pitched in open gaming at all, but seats are filled by word of mouth and negotiation. Would I pitch Poison'd in open gaming? I'm not sure I would. But that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372375/#Comment_372375" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T10:59:11+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 10:59AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben championed (via Story Games Seattle) a newer, friendlier approach to talking about Veils. While Ron's earlier formulation felt very, "Bad shit could happen, here's how you solve that problem," the way I've heard Ben talk about it is much more, "Whenever you want something to stay off the table, here's a simple tool that you get to use in that moment." I think couched in really positive terms, that little discussion of Veils can turn into an empowerment thing rather than a defensive thing.<br/><br/>Lots of people have expressed a fear in starting story games, due to the worry that "it could get really weird or uncomfortable." The Veil is potentially a way of reassuring people that they are empowered participants, and can control their environment as needed.<br/><br/>I've seen lots of people benefit from this newer expression of "The Veil."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372377/#Comment_372377" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T11:16:54+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 11:16AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2012 11:38AM by Mathalus.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shoot, this turned into a long post. I started writing it to respond to Sage, but now I\u2019m glad that others have also chipped in. Because I think this is great stuff. <br/><br/>This is fascinating to me, because my default would be that the Veil is especially necessary for cons. If a stranger at your table brings up something at the con table that another stranger at your table thinks is triggering or too much or whatever, what do you do? Do you try to deal with it then somehow or gloss over it and move on? (edit: JWalt talks about this above). I know that this doesn\u2019t happen often, even at Cons. Usually people are just delightedly motivated to game and there is no trouble.<br/>In fact, I had been doing the veil thing before games for a long time, and <b>I had never seen it used</b>, so I was starting to think that maybe it was unnecessary. But then two things happened:<br/><br/>1. Knowing that the safety brake is there changes how you drive (for the better, I'd argue). <br/><br/>2. I saw it get used at the Emerald City Comic Con we (Sage and I) volunteered at. <br/><br/>So, to help me get across the first point, I want to mention the points I always cover when I talk about the Veil. In my mind, this is very close to Ben\u2019s version of the Veil. (Also fans of Sorcerer might notice that this is inspired by that, but different). <br/><br/><i>Playing with strangers is the best, but since we don't all know each other, we have this one rule that <b>trumps all the other rules</b> in the games today. It's sort of a safety brake. If something comes up in the fiction that is <b>triggering</b> or makes you <b>uncomfortable</b>, or dealing with that today <b>will just ruin your fun</b>, you can just say, \u201cI Veil that\u201d. What this means is that we will <b>remove it from the fiction or narrate around it</b>. For example, maybe a clown scorpion killed your best friend. When I say, \u201cThen there are, like, 15 clown scorpions all over you.\u201d You can say, \u201cI Veil clown scorpions.\u201d And here is the thing, <b>you don\u2019t have to justify</b> why you don\u2019t want something included. In fact, we don\u2019t really want to know what your deal is with clown scorpions. Sometimes, if you are one of those people who are good at social cues, you might notice that <b>someone looks uncomfortable</b> with how the fiction is going, but they haven\u2019t drawn the Veil yet. <b>You can Veil for other people</b>. Just point out the thing in the fiction that looks like it might be the culprit and say, \u201cHey, maybe we should Veil this.\u201d If you get the slightest head nod or agreement, <b>go ahead and Veil that shit</b>. And of course, <b>you can Veil your own stuff</b> if it starts to squick you out. The final thing to know about the Veil is that if you introduce something in the fiction and someone else Veils it, <b>you aren\u2019t a jerk</b> for having brought it up. You didn\u2019t know that I was afraid of clown scorpions, and we are all just riffing stuff off the top of our heads. We will not assume that you are a <b>clown scorpion fetishist</b>. Now, if you bring up something that was already Veiled, <b>your jerk status will be reviewed</b>. Just remember to Veil easy. </i><br/><br/>Okay, long speech. Anyway, I believe that these points about the Veil make people feel more comfortable than less. Also it protects me when I want to introduce nutso stuff. I can worry less about how others might react if I know that we have already talked about removing that kind of thing. Finally, the combination of the "you don't have to justify and the "jerk clause" as I like to call them is invaluable to me. It means in the unlikely event that something ugly comes up, we can deal with it and continue playing with minimal bad feelings.<br/><br/>The second point I made above touches on this. Another facilitator and I sat down to demo Shock for "one or two hours". I gave a short Spiel, which included the Veil. The other facilitator ended up drawing the Veil over an element that the new player introduced during character creation. This brand new Story Gamer, who had never heard of this kind of game before seeing the sign on the table, shrugged their shoulders and switched that element out. Then <b>we kept playing</b>.<br/><br/>Wrapping it up here: I gave the Veil speech a lot of times, but it only got used once. Was it making more people uncomfortable than comfortable?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372382/#Comment_372382" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T11:45:56+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 11:45AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding veils, here is what I do and it has worked almost every single time (and I run games for 500-1,000+ people a year):<br/><br/><br/>- I usually wait till after we introduce ourselves.<br/><br/>- I grab an index card and draw an X on it.<br/><br/>- "I'd like your help. Your help to make this game fun for everyone. If anything in the game makes anyone uncomfortable, just simply lift this card up. Don't explain why. When the card is lifted, we simply edit out any uncomfortable content and move forward. I know it sounds funny but it's helped us play amazing games together and more often than not I'm the one who ends up using the X card to protect myself from you all!" <br/><br/>Note: Each of these words is chosen precisely. But I will change these words depending on the game. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Why do I do this?<br/><br/>- I've repeatedly had someone say they don't want Y in a game and then they are the ones who bring Y into the game!<br/>- I've repeatedly had people say they were ok with something when clearly they weren't.<br/>- Some people who are uncomfortable are already on edge and sometimes won't clearly communicate. Lifting a card is easier than saying something. You don't even have to look anyone in the eye, interrupt the person talking, or talk over someone to do it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If we are playing a game where it's important to pre-decide what isn't in a game, I'll have everyone secretly write what they don't want on an index card and hand it to me.<br/><br/>If I know a game is going to feature sensitive content, I will let everyone know asap and give them an easy way to opt out of the game if needed. <br/><br/>Next time I GM I plan to try giving each player an X card so they don't have to reach towards the middle of the table to grab the card (depending on the table or their arm length, they may not be able to reach it).<br/><br/><br/>Usually I use a lot of other techniques in addition to the above to create safe spaces. Like tokens to track spotlight and giving the person an option to pass but earn additional token to do even more stuff later when they feel more comfortable. Or making it clear that you don't have to speak in character or act at all. Just saying what your pawn is doing as if it was a video game works fine. And I have lots of ways to use body language, voice, and seating arrangements to increase comfort as needed. It's also great to make it clear how they can get help, that no experience is needed, that we are all here to help each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372384/#Comment_372384" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T11:50:16+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 11:50AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the card idea.

Since it's so immediate it's often clearly attached to something that was just said. In general I try to avoid any discussion if I can help it. But to be fair, I'm experienced in reading people so what's obvious to me may not be obvious to others. If something isn't obvious, I would ask, "just so we know what we're editing out, is it Y or something else?" and then I'll thank them for helping make the game fun. If the situation can't be resolved in a minute or less, I'll call for a break and speak to the person privately. I try to avoid a situation where someone who's already uncomfortable now has 10 eyes staring at them while they try to explain themselves. At that point for some people it would be more comfortable for them to quit the game or accept the thing that originally made them uncomfortable. <br/><br/>I've seen situations where the uncomfortable topic was less uncomfortable than the technique used to discuss discomfort!

Pros and Cons of talking about Veils just to the large group before pitching.<br/><br/>2. Pros and Cons of talking about Veils just in the individual groups (table level).<br/><br/>3. Pros and Cons of talking about the Veil twice (one in the large group and then again at the table level). <br/><br/><br/>You are driving at something that sucks about yelling at a big crowd about being uncomfortable, but I am being dense. Break it down for me more if you have time. Also talk more about the Veil making folks uncomfortable in general. This is useful stuff. <br/><br/>I think my main "con" about relying exclusively on Veils at the table level is that they will be forgotten. I know that I have sat down a bunch and forgotten them. Is there a good solution for the Gamestorm, Indie Hurricane, Open Gaming Circle that would include a blanket speech at the beginning that could then be added to at the table level? Which parts of John (Jenskot's) speech or my speech are most likely to weird folks out in a big group (and therefore should be left to the table level judgement of facilitators)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372392/#Comment_372392" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T12:18:07+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 12:18PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like jenskot's version better, mostly because it's something a group of people who are going to play together for a while learn together, not something we say to a room of eager gamers.<br/><br/>This may just be me, but talking veils ahead of time in a general sense tends to actually make me a bit nervous.

But... dunh dunh dunh. What does the GoD organizer mention about them?<br/><br/>Is it:<br/><br/>Everyone make sure you get one of these cards. They have something on the back if you feel like reading right now.<br/><br/>Or is it:<br/><br/>Playing with strangers is the best, but since we don't all know each other, we have these Cards that trump all the other rules in the games today. It's sort of a safety brake. If something comes up in the fiction that is triggering or makes you uncomfortable, or dealing with that today will just ruin your fun, you can just lift up your Card to show the X. What this means is that we will remove that thing from the fiction or narrate around it. For example, maybe a clown scorpion killed your best friend. When I say, \u201cThen there are, like, 15 clown scorpions all over you.\u201d You can lift your Card, and poof no more clown scorpions. And here is the thing, you don\u2019t have to justify why you don\u2019t want something included. In fact, we don\u2019t really want to know what your deal is with clown scorpions. Sometimes, if you are one of those people who are good at social cues, you might notice that someone looks uncomfortable with how the fiction is going, but they haven\u2019t drawn lifted their Card yet. You can lift your Card for other people. And of course, you can lift your Card for your own stuff if it starts to squick you out. The final thing to know about the Card is that if you introduce something in the fiction and someone else lifts their Card, you aren\u2019t a jerk for having brought it up. You didn\u2019t know that I was afraid of clown scorpions, and we are all just riffing stuff off the top of our heads. We will not assume that you are a clown scorpion fetishist. Now, if you bring up something that was already Carded, your jerk status will be reviewed. Just remember to Card easy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Or is it probably something in between? (Because both of those are obnoxiously tongue in cheek). <br/><br/>And it probably matters what the back of the card says, too, since they should go together.<br/><br/><br/>I'm going to admit my bias. I like repetition. If I think something is useful for players, I am for giving it to them multiple times in multiple versions (written, verbal, tactile).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372409/#Comment_372409" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T12:46:49+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 12:46PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking somewhere in the middle, like:<br/><br/><i>Each table has some X-Cards</i> (or whatever we call them) <i>in the middle.

Does the card then say John's points pretty much? Hey, I just had a thought and I need your help shutting it down.<br/><br/>I thought up another clause to my rapidly expanding speech about Veils. JWalt, Sage and others, you indicated that bringing up that triggering stuff wasn\u2019t always appropriate for all games. I\u2019m sure that what I\u2019ve written below wouldn\u2019t fix that, but just confirm it for me. Inserting this into the long speech above won\u2019t fix everything, right?<br/><br/>\u201cListen, something triggering might never show up if you are going to play a game about mice going to repair the apiary. It might never show up in any of your games today at all.

Here is a breakdown of why I chose these specific words...<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>"I'd like your help."</i><br/><br/>A lot of times we don't get what we want in life because we don't ask for it. This also makes it clear that it's not all on me. <br/><br/><br/><i>"Your help to make this game fun for everyone."</i><br/><br/>State the goal, set expectations. Make it clear it's not about individuals but the group.<br/><br/><br/><i>"If anything in the game makes anyone uncomfortable..."</i><br/><br/>I switch from saying "you" to "anyone" and "we" below to reinforce it's about the group's needs. I say "anything" so it's not limited or specific because I don't want to prejudge what people find uncomfortable because it's subjective and I'm not here to judge. <br/><br/><br/><i>"...just simply lift this card up."</i><br/><br/>It's so easy! I will then actually lift the card to make it clear physically how easy it is.<br/><br/><br/><i>"Don't explain why."</i><br/><br/>Explaining is bad because it's extra effort, a higher barrier to accomplish your goal, and it can feel like being put on trial. Plus explanations means more time not playing.<br/><br/><br/><i>"When the card is lifted, we simply edit out any uncomfortable content..."</i><br/><br/>Repeat what they need to do "lift the card" and emphasize how it is simple and fast. <br/><br/><br/><i>"...and move forward."</i><br/><br/>Nothing to see here. The focus shifts back to having fun, not judgement. <br/><br/><br/><i>"I know it sounds funny but it will help us play amazing games together..."</i><br/><br/>It does sound funny to most people so I prefer to acknowledge what most people are thinking than let it go unsaid. Saying it out loud takes away its stigma and says "I understand" + "but trust me".<br/><br/><br/><i>"...and usually I'm the one who ends up using the X card to protect myself from you all!"</i> <br/><br/>It's not just about them, it's also about me. We're in this together. The rules apply to everyone. And it takes the edge off a potential serious topic by ending with humor. <br/><br/>I will then usually X-Card myself early on in the game. Say I describe a gory fight, I might say out loud, "whoa John, relax there" and lift the X-Card on myself to show everyone it's no big deal and I'd rather make the game comfortable for everyone and put my own ego aside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KryptoTheSuperdog" title="KryptoTheSuperdog"><img alt="KryptoTheSuperdog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KryptoTheSuperdog">KryptoTheSuperdog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372473/#Comment_372473" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T19:53:35+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  7:53PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was my first gaming convention ever.

It was great.<br/><br/>With Veils, remember that the people who need them are the people who are least likely to speak up. If you're genuinely uncomfortable with, say, domestic violence, then you're unlikely to begin the game by saying "I have issues with domestic violence!". John's X Card makes this better, but not entirely, since it still relies on the individual making their discomfort known. What I'm saying is: people should still be sensitive to what they're saying and looking out for people who look uncomfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372483/#Comment_372483" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T21:50:43+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  9:50PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger, thanks for speaking up.

I included a request to be up-front about boundaries, sensitive subject matter, creating a safe space, etc. and linked Ben Robbins' "the veil" blog post.<br/><br/>I didn't really have pitching the veil to the whole circle in mind; I pictured it more as an individual-to-the-game thing, for several reasons mentioned above. But what with shepherding the whole Indie Hurricane experience, I never ended up facilitating the pitching circle myself, and folks like Ben, Morgan and Ross, who have experience running just such a circle, stepped up and did it how they did it. I was happy for their help and leadership.<br/><br/>I do lean toward discussing the Veil at individual tables. As I said, many folks in this thread have brought up good reasons for that.<br/><br/>I love love LOVE the "X card" thing, and having a fancy schmancy card at every IH table would be slick. I'm of two minds about calling attention to it in the pitch--seems to put us back in the position of "let's make people uncomfortable by mentioning that it might be uncomfortable." Maybe privately emailing facilitators about use of the card would be enough? Though I do think it's a fair point about GMs forgetting to talk about this stuff.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: KryptoTheSuperdog</cite>This was my first gaming convention ever.

It's really up to the organizers of individual games to engage with their players and create the kind of social environment that's going to facilitate a positive play experience</blockquote>\nYes, I strongly agree about this. I talk about lines and veils at the table, where I can watch players' reactions to see if they accept the idea or aren't getting it, which I then take into account when running. Rattling it off in a big anonymous mob isn't going to create a safe space just because the words were said. But it may be useful to introduce the concept via the Spiel, reinforced at the table by GMs/facilitators.<br/>I'm not a fan of blurring the distinction between veils and lines, but in the interests of keeping the Spiel to manageable length I can live with it.<br/><br/>I really liked the booklets at Fabricated Realities that listed the principles of play; I'd like to see that at Gamestorm (and at all indie game<br/>events) but I don't know how many people read them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372996/#Comment_372996" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-15T17:42:38+00:00" title="April 15, 2012  5:42PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Carl</cite><br/>I'm not a fan of blurring the distinction between veils and lines, but in the interests of keeping the Spiel to manageable length I can live with it.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think the Oly Veil should be called The Handbrake or something, to distinguish it from the Veil as many of us know it--but I realize that it doesn't really matter.

I want to emphasize that play continues rather than stopping. That said, I don't have a better one. Also, it's the PNW Veil. Or the Sea-Oly Veil?

As Vincent brilliantly said in another context, "Permissions and Expectations are the basic building blocks of human interaction", and I find permissions and expectations a handy way to think about such matters.<br/><br/>Handbrake makes me think of Bootlegger's Reverse, which is probably not the metaphor you're looking for.<br/><br/>I'm intrigued by the X card as a non-verbal signal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Sixpack" title="Joe_Sixpack"><img alt="Joe_Sixpack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Sixpack">Joe_Sixpack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380046/#Comment_380046" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T09:02:00+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  9:02AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought about sending some whispers, but I figure I'll ask for the good of the polity.
