I've read through the first three chapters of this little book.  So far I'm very excited about it; it's an easy and fun read, well organized, well laid out (another impeccable Fred Hicks job), and well edited (I've only spotted one typo to date, and it was one a spell-checker would not catch.)  <br/><br/>I won't be able to tell how well the system works until I try it but on simple reading, it looks like a ton of fun.  It's possible that it may not flow as well as it reads in actual play, but I'm hopeful.  It has a lot of elements that I love in other games, and I'm stoked to play.  Alas, it will probably have to wait for a few weeks.  Reading the book, I was wondering how well it would adapt to other settings, and I readily thought of "Tales from the Floating Vagabond", "Callahan Cross-Time Saloon", "Tales of the Vulgar Unicorn", and of course "Tales from the Cantina."  The key phrases would only need to be reworded a little (not that I won't be enirely satisfied playing Vernian, Wellsian and Haggardian adventures.)<br/><br/>I have only one criticism, and it's that I really don't like the cover art.  I would not be attracted by the cover to pick this up at the store, and I don't think it transmits the feel of the game.  At best, I'm reminded of 1980s games like the old Tri Tac Games books.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88354/#Comment_88354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T09:35:24+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  9:35AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Squeeeee!  I'm really enjoying this book so far.  I've just finished reading through Chapter 4, the heftiest in the book -- a relative concept in an easy-read 120-page book.  I find the writing very clear, and I appreciate the numerous and helpful play examples and bullet point rules summaries.  I believe Eric said somewhere that this book was not intended for newcomers but for experienced gamers; but with very little additional explanations, I think this might be an excellent introduction to story games for complete newcomers.  <br/><br/>I'm guessing, of course; I won't really know until I try playing it.  The timed narration may be a challenge for some of my players who are particularly prone to kibitzing and digressions.  Who knows, it might help keep the issue under control!  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88379/#Comment_88379" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T10:36:57+00:00" title="August 16, 2007 10:36AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a PDF copy.

While Fred did indeed design my character and adventure sheets, I did the text layout myself with some great feedback from jim pinto. So I'm pleased it looks good enough that it might be mistaken for Fred's always awesome work. I'd appreciate it if you would shoot me an email about the typo you found and any others you see so I can exterminate them in the next printing.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the other kind words guys. I had a great time at Gen Con and am pleased with the game's reception so far.
