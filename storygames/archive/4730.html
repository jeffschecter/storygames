I'll be encouraging GMs to run one shots rather than campaigns, because I don't want the meet up to become closed to new comers as people come a couple of times get into a cliche and sit with the same people, playing the same campaign everytime. Personally I also like the idea of running one shots because I've lots of games that I haven't time to run with my home group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current venue is Fanboy 3 in Piccadilly Fan Boy 3, 17 Newton street, Manchester, M1 1FZ<br/>\n<br/>\nSee <a href="http://www.fanboy3.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fanboy3.co.uk/</a> for directions/location<br/>\n<br/>\nDates booked at present;<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday 11th November<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday 16th December<br/>\n<br/>\nTime: Starts 12PM Games start 1 PM Close 5pm<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information about games being offered please see our forum over at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/index.php?f=61" rel="nofollow">UK Roleplayers.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nContact newt@goplaymanchester.org.uk, website <a href="http://www.goplaymanchester.org.uk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goplaymanchester.org.uk</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
