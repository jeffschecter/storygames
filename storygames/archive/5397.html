It's a card game.  There's a lot of reasons why I wanted to post about it here, but I'll go into that in a little bit.<br/><br/>So, I finished my first game.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.peccable.com/images/complete-breakfast.gif"/><br/><br/>It's called REALPOLITIK.  I've been working on it, off and on, for the last three or four years, and after what turned out to be an incredible amount of work, I finally got it published.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with the results.<br/><br/>It's a tongue-in-cheek game about backstabbing governments manipulating and destroying people, places, and events for their own advancement.<br/><br/>Sound familiar?  Yeah, I've been living in the U.S. for the past few years, too.<br/><br/>I'm offering it for sale at my site (www.peccable.com) and I'll be bringing a bunch of copies and promo cards with me to Dreamation this year.<br/><br/>Which brings me to why I'm posting about this non-story game here.<br/><br/>First, there's the fact that I've been a part of this community for a while now. Mostly lurking, to be honest, but starting with finding the Forge I discovered this whole world of people who were talking about games in a way I'd never thought of before -- of looking at what was out there and deciding what worked and what didn't and making it their own.<br/><br/>And then going out and doing something with that vision.  Just going out and making games and then going "Here.  This is what I came up with."<br/><br/>That kind of blew my mind.<br/><br/>And then I went and wrote some things -- some of them worked, some of them didn't.  I wrote an RPG for Game Chef 2006, and it ended up as one of the finalists.<br/><br/>And last year at Dreamation I got to meet a couple of these people face to face. I got to play Polaris with Ben Lehman and shock: with Joshua Newman.  I got to link real people with these books I'd owned for awhile, got to see the people behind them.<br/><br/>And I guess part of me went "You know, you could probably do something like that, too."<br/><br/>So, I guess the point of this post is: uhm, well, I did.<br/><br/>So, if you see me at Dreamation and want to hear about it, or just put a face to the guy who created this thing, please -- say hi, and ask about the game.  I'll be more than happy enough to show it off. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>-d-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121102/#Comment_121102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T18:54:00+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  6:54PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Awesome!

I'm planning on bringing a demo copy with me.  I'll be throwing down willy-nilly, as Mr. Newman put it.  From what I see on my schedule, I'll be down Friday morning and after the first session (9 am - 1 pm), I'm free until the 8pm session, so if anyone's interested, please either post here or email me via peccable.com.  Either that or just ask around.<br/><br/>Ben -- Yay for happy, boo for sad!  Sucks you won't be there.  I somehow assumed you would be, as I'd love to play with you again.<br/><br/>Bill_White -- I don't know if the game would be what you're looking for -- it takes itself very unseriously.  You can see an example of play <a href="http://peccable.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=41" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which has an actual game layout and playthrough of a turn, which might give you a better idea of what the game's all about.<br/><br/>Regarding printing and production, I'd be happy to do a detailed description of what was involved, but I'll do it in a seperate post a little bit later when I have time.<br/><br/>Thanks again for the great response.

The final version ended up being: 105 double-sided, black-on-white cards, full-bleed and a manual and storage envelope.<br/><br/>The artwork was definitely an issue.  Every single card (I mean *every* single card) needed artwork.  A large part of the gameplay is based on symbols for types of cards, and agent skills.  Further, the way I designed the cards left room for artwork on each.  While there were some repeats, it came to almost 90 individual pieces.<br/><br/>I started down the path of commisioning the artwork, but to be honest - that way lay madness.  There was just so much artwork needed that (a) it would take forever to find and (b) it would be prohibitively expensive.  And I really didn't like the idea of having to depend so heavily on someone else in order to get the game done.<br/><br/>Randomly, a friend of mine mentioned that he'd gotten the idea of dressing up people and taking pictures for a Super Heroes RPG he was working on.  I decided to steal it and run.  I e-mailed all my friends and set up a couple of photo shoot days.<br/><br/>People showed up with props, costumes, and ideas.  Some of the cards were particularly abstract, but people really rose to the challenge -- coming up with ideas on the fly that I'd never have thought of myself.  It was a total blast.<br/><br/>To give the agent cards a different look, I ran the images through a Photoshop filter to make them look more like drawings.  I really liked the end result of all the cards.<br/><br/>The iconography I created through a freeware program called Inkscape, which is a godsend to someone like me; someone who thinks in text and not images.  It creates Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which are basically line-images that can be drawn through text descriptions - put a line here, a circle here, a path here.<br/><br/>As for printing, I went through a local print broker called Communication Graphics (<a href="www.comgraphics.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.comgraphics.com</a>).  They came highly recommended by my partner, who'd worked with them in a professional capacity.  They don't by any means specialize in games or the like.<br/><br/>They were, however, absolutely incredible, constantly working with us to give us exactly what we needed.  To be perfectly honest, I didn't really shop around.  When they quoted us a price, it seemed very reasonable to me and I went with it.<br/><br/>They gave us a great set of proofs, and worked with us to resolve any issues that came up.<br/><br/>Almost any issues we ran into were, honestly, my fault.  I'd never done anything like this before, so really understanding things like how bleeds are supposed to work took some time.<br/><br/>Packaging and bundling were done by the printer.  The cards were bundled in two shrink-wrapped packages per unit, and placed in the pre-printed envelope along with a manual.<br/><br/>I think that covers everything.  If anyone has any particular questions, please let me know. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122274/#Comment_122274" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T05:08:53+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  5:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you very much for all that. <br/><br/>And good to see a mention of Inkscape, a great little package with a reasonably gentle learning curve.<br/><br/>If it's not a pain, what sort of costs were involved? I've got a sense of how much, say, an 80-page book costs to print. But your game has a whole different format.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somniturne" title="somniturne"><img alt="somniturne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somniturne">somniturne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122495/#Comment_122495" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T16:39:56+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  4:39PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played a few rounds of this at Dreamation and from what I could see the game was really successful!
