Haunt Me is a short-form, experimental roleplaying game about the pain we hide from others.</i><br/></p>\nHowdy StoryGamers!<br/><br/>Some of you may remember Haunt Me from the New Year's bundle I ran a couple of months ago. I intended to make Haunt Me available by itself almost immediately after that event in January but I ended up hitting some snags as I will talk about in a moment. But I of course want to talk a bit about the game itself before that.<br/><br/>My initial experience with RPGs was really in freeform games where it really was just collaborative storytelling with no real systems in place. That was the kind of stuff I mainly played back when I was around 12 to 13 years old. Of course, as I played more and more I realized I wanted more of a structure to the games - they weren't really games if I could always just say I did this and that, right? The first RPGs that I seriously explored were still more light on systems and gamey elements and focused on the story. You could say they were primarily "Story Games," heh. Of course, as I got older I branched out to liking other stuff, as well. Things such as World of Darkness and DnD are always great, but I still like checking out games where the systems are pared back a bit and the story is the main thing that shines through. <br/><br/>Haunt Me, along those lines, is an experiment in storytelling. It is much shorter, more focused, and probably even a lot more restricting than most freeform games would be, however, it shares that core idea of the story being the star. I think it would probably spoil the experience a bit to explain more about it than what is said here but there are two main concepts behind it. The first is, obviously, trying to create an experience that prompts an interesting story. You come into the game as a stranger among strangers - you do not know them and they do not know you but each of you has to share a deeply personal piece of yourself if you want to escape the haunted house. The second concept revolves around playing with the idea of who is really the winner and who is the loser? Which, if you play the game, I think you will see what I mean.<br/><br/>In the end, Haunt Me is just a short and, hopefully, pleasant experience. It is not meant to be the best game ever or anything like that but I hope you will give it a try if the ideas behind it interest you, at all.<br/><br/>I actually intended to release Haunt Me alongside another game back in October. Unfortunately, work started to slow to a trickle around that time which lead to me focusing on trying to find new work. This ended up with me pushing the game release back to December. Eventually I ended up losing my job around the time that I released my game, The Legerdemain Betrayers. I tried to keep positive and, luckily, I had already planned this New Year's bundle event (where I sold all of my games together in a bundle along with extra items) a long while before any of that happened which helped pay for my groceries. Bad timing being what it is, I realized I had to move as I was not going to be able to eat at all - or possibly even afford the rent, in any case - if I stayed where I was living at that point. A friend ended up helping me pay for the last month's rent and I was able to peacefully put that behind me rather than panicking about all kinds of things. <br/><br/>Anyway, I guess the point is that this reminded me of why I started making these games and putting them out the way I have been - selling them at a very affordable price while still trying to put my best work into each book. I have said this before but I have never had all that much money. Growing up, I couldn't always just save up my money to buy the things I wanted - there was often something in the "needs" category that took precedence over the "wants". This often applied to RPG books and anything else I would have loved to get. So I understand and still experience what it's like to be on the edge of wanting some cool new thing and not being able to afford it (at least not without having to spare a meal or two). <br/><br/>Going back to Haunt Me: this is the second edition of the game. It is not a second edition in that it completely revises the ruleset - it's more about minor tweaks behind the design of the book that were made. Having to move meant I did not have time to put Haunt Me out when I originally planned to but it also meant that I ended up not really taking a look at the book for a while, having other things on my mind. Even if I wanted to play a session of the game, the concepts and rules of Haunt Me were so fresh in my mind that I did not need to check the book to see what's what. Now that I have had time to settle down and look at the book I see it a bit differently and I wanted to reflect that. I did not make any major changes to the design and layout - just minor color and detail tweaks (not to mention some embarrassing typo and grammar corrections that were not caught!). So if you bought Haunt Me when it was available during the New Year's bundle event, then there is no need to get it again - in fact, you can probably consider this a bit of a bonus as you now are the owner of an 'out-of-print' version of the book, haha. <br/><br/>If you got through all of that text, I want to thank you for sharing some of your time with me. I especially want to thank the Story Games community as a whole for being plain awesome. I lost my appetite for forums a long time ago with all the bickering and sorts of behaviors you would usually see. It's great to get to just read through some interesting discussions without having to experience that. Story Games has pretty much become my hub for RPG info and news so, really, hats off to you all. If you have not had a chance to check out my other books and are still on the fence about them, use this code: <b>storygames40</b> during your purchase. This code is exclusive to the Story Games community for <b>40% off</b> God-king and The Legerdemain Betrayers, my other two RPGs. You have to buy through the second payment option, GumRoad, to use it. If the code runs out of uses, just whisper me and I'll give you a new one.<br/><br/>You can check out Haunt Me at <a href="http://spiffup.org/hauntmet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://spiffup.org/hauntmet</a> It is a 10 page, full color, PDF, immediate download for $0.99 USD. I would really love to hear what you think about it and the other games if you get a chance to giving them a try.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>-Daniel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
