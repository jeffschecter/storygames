There were five players plus myself.  It was fun with a lot of entertaining moments but there were some rough patches.  This is a post to debrief what happened and think about solutions for it.  <br/><br/><b>PROBLEM 1</b>:  Psi turned into the dump risk for rolls.  I got narration fatigue from having to explain a bunch of national-news scale disasters, and because I wasn't making them sting, they attracted more and more of the poor dice.  Eventually, I just wanted to ignore them. <br/><b>SOLUTIONS:</b>\n<ul><li> Use my right to demand rolls and lash out randomly with it whenever a psi disaster happens.  Pick a character in the same location as the disaster and drop a helicopter or a building on them and make them roll to get away.  Frame these victims hard into ambulances, into scenes with paramedics defibrilating them or jacking IVs into their veins.  <br/></li><li> Hit their consciences and their backbones by throwing sympathetic and rescuable NPCs into the maelstrom.  Tempt them into being heroes!<br/></li><li>Hack the game a bit; put a disaster track on it so that after a certain number of psi disasters the game is over and no one wins.</li></ul>\n<b>PROBLEM 2</b>. The game was incoherent.  It was rare that I believed that these five people had tumbled out of the same burning RV together.  Only two had a really connected story. One character, Candace, had a question that directly referred to another player, Samuel.  Candace also supplied the answer to one of Samuel's questions ("Who is this girl I keep seeing in my head?") <br/><b>SOLUTIONS:</b>\n<ul><li>Fewer players.  <br/></li><li>Require that each player author at least two questions that refer to another character.<br/></li><li>Make sure that I have a reference sheet with all questions on it; try to hit 2+ questions whenever I open my mouth.</li></ul>\n<b>PROBLEM 3:</b> We were puzzled with the narration rights on the null results.  What does a player do with first say on a no injury, no memory triggered, no psi disaster, etc result?<br/><br/><b>PROBLEM 4:</b> We'd inadvertently answer questions outside of flashbacks.  Weren't sure what to do with this, it felt weird to allow players to advance towards victory without engaging the risk sheet.<br/><br/>I really want to learn to run this game well, its multivariant dicing system and created-in-play map feel super hot!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374672/#Comment_374672" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T06:20:45+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  6:20AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!<br/><br/>Quick thoughts:<br/><br/>- "First say" isn't "only say". <br/><br/>- So if they choose a devastating Psi result and GM has first say, you can still turn it back on the players. I also had the issue where Psi became the dump stat in a 5 player game (which gets exhausting fast). So I turned to the player and said, "it says people in a mass scale are dead, tell us who is dead, and make it people your character would care about". Quickly Psi was no longer a dump stat. If this doesn't work, do what make sense in the fiction, a mass scale disaster probably means PCs are making rolls to avoid Harm or drawing attention. Turn to them and say, "building are falling down all around you, how do you now die?"<br/><br/>- In your game, who answered the triggered memories? Was it typically the player who triggered the memory? Other players? The GM? I find that when it's the other players, memories start to intersect with other players but this may not always be the case. This probably goes back to "first say isn't the only say". After a PC answers, the GM can still add contributions. The GM could make the memory tie to other players or simple ask, "let's tie some of these memories together, what does your memory have to do with X, Y, or Zs?"<br/><br/>- We use narration on a null result to flesh out characters and foreshadow. What memory did you almost trigger? Why that memory? What stopped you? Or... you were about to have your leg chopped off but then you _____________________ ?<br/><br/>- Before the game I would underline that even if you appear to answer questions without rolling, you don't know what's real or isn't real. You may not be who you think you are. Your power may not be what you think it is. Anything and everything can change. When we roll, we may flip everything upside down and twist it all till the lies shatter and what's underneath may be something we don't want.... but it will be the truth. Building in the assumptions of, "maybe we don't really know yet" and "big twists can and will happen" often ramps up tension, excitement, and suspends disbelief.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374702/#Comment_374702" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T09:39:55+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  9:39AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is just based on one play of the game (X-Men Days of Future Past), with just having the rules verbally explained to me.<br/><br/>1 - Psi/Power definitely felt like a "dump roll" to me, although I felt guilty about it most of the time.  I think making it more explicit how it's causing trouble in the future might help.  Maybe writing out specific consequences for these failures and forcing rolls when they come up.  (Population is terrified, so you have to roll to find/convince someone to help you where before you might have gotten help directly.  High Alert, so you have to roll to move through previously "safe" areas.  Or roll to prevent being betrayed, etc.)  That's similar to what you're saying about demanding rolls, with the potential for delays and story ways of working around them.  But they still feel like problems accumulating.<br/>4 - Our GM had us roll (no Harm, nor Power) for anything that we thought might answer a question, or if we had an idea for an answer.  Failed Goal, Successful Question for these rolls is a grey area, but didn't really stand out.  The chance of watchers catching up while we thought about it was still there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374707/#Comment_374707" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T09:57:41+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  9:57AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2012 9:59AM by jenskot.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cy's post above just inspired some new thoughts!<br/><br/>(plus I just finished eating ice cream which rocks for inspiration)<br/><br/>In games that use props, sometimes we get fixated on those props to the detriment of elements not physically represented. <br/><br/>In Psi*Run, we have props to represent locations, memories, risks we take, harm, the chase of being captured, our characters, and the people chasing us. <br/><br/>I've noticed that sometimes the NPCs get lost in the shuffle so last game (taking a page from Marvel) I represented each major NPC with a sticky that I placed on the table. The sticky didn't do anything special, it was just the person's name and maybe 1 or 2 relevant details. But all of a sudden they were being incorporated into people's memories, people were identifying them by name, and attributing more meaning to them than I've experienced before in previous Psi*Run games. <br/><br/>Could we do the same with the consequences of powers going out of control? \n<blockquote>1\u20132: Power goes wild: people are dead, things destroyed \u2014 it would make national news. GM has first say.</blockquote>\nIf it makes national news, why not write the headline down on a sticky and slap it on the table. "3,000 dead, more injured, unconfirmed cause, special forces called in, they have suspects."<br/><br/>You could also stop and ask players:<br/>- "How does this make you feel?"<br/>- "Does this remind you of anything?"<br/>- "Does it trigger a memory?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374718/#Comment_374718" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T10:43:51+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 10:43AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2012 11:06AM by johnzo.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff guys, please keep it coming!  <br/><br/>It seems like the GMing principle of Psi*Run is this:<br/><br/><b>The game is a chase; the pursuit is powered by the dice, so the game should aggressively push towards the dice.  If the players are not pushing towards rolls, then the GM should do so.  Look at everything through the lens of creating new dice rolls.</b>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>- We use narration on a null result to flesh out characters and foreshadow. What memory did you almost trigger? Why that memory? What stopped you? Or... you were about to have your leg chopped off but then you _____________________ ?</blockquote>\nI didn't try any of that because I think I was being too respectful of "player has first say" and so I didn't jump in to narrate any nulls.  But now that I think about it, if a player passes on their first say, that totally opens the door for the GM or anyone else to jump into the narration.  If I can model the potentials of narrating a 'null' risk then that'll help the table get some juice out of those risks.  So the takeaway here is to prompt for narration on nulls and to look for opportunities to model that narration and roll it into future die rolls.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cy</cite>4 - Our GM had us roll (no Harm, nor Power) for anything that we thought might answer a question, or if we had an idea for an answer.

So i might be telling you in the wrong direction. but this bit worked for me.<br/><br/>Problem 1: probably 5 people are waaaay too much. the impression i got is that 3 or 4 players are good, 2 can be exciting too, over 4 it gets messy (i DID try to run a game with 7 players: it was improptu, at a park with some friends, and just before we played a bunch of other friends popped out of nowhere. the beginning was fun, but it wasn't going anywhere.)<br/><br/>Problem 2: To make sure the backstory would tie up nicely, i adapted a piece of advice Joshua Newman actually gave us when demoing Shock:, namely, <i>Think Big</i>. The questions are the best, if not the only, way to actually decide what's out there; tell your players to make each and every answer count, and to make it big, to make it not only a part of the character's past, or a distinctive trait, but to make it say something about the rest of the world, the other characters, the people that chase you. set the bar high, and encourage being bold and inventive: i had players who had only played D&amp;D in their life and usually waited for GM input for eveyrthing coming up with the most exciting backstory. Also, i don't know how the dice are divided in the Final edition, but we had them allocated so that it would be easier for characters to answer to other character's questions (i believe moving it from 6 only to 5-6, but i'm not sure, and again, that was the ashcan). If you encourage that, in my experience, players will actually start to like it, and become really cooperative. After a few  experiences, I've had players (again, coming from a trad background) choosing to have other players answer their questions instead of answering themselves, because they thought it was more fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374913/#Comment_374913" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T08:31:55+00:00" title="April 29, 2012  8:31AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keith, I'm going to disagree with you on <i>Chronicle,</i> having just watched it. The reason being that there is nothing like a Chaser in it, whereas <i>Push</i> and <i>Jumper</i> had Division and Paladins, respectively. <i>Chronicle</i> certainly had out-of-control teen powers, but it felt too sandboxy, with no defined opposition, and so in my opinion didn't reflect the desperation that Psi*Run can offer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377189/#Comment_377189" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T13:59:56+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  1:59PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2012 2:03PM by johnzo.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had a second try at this game at Nemocon.  We had some fun scenes, I thought, but also had more problems that need debugging.<br/><br/>Our table was me + three players.  Harry's guy sees dead people.  Jackson's woman has a vampire-like form of smoke.  Ross's guy has a a "not the stormtroopers you're looking for" influence power but also has a question about "how can I tell that what I see is real?"   <br/><br/>Desiring coherence, I pushed them toward a spirit / ghost world that's overlaid on reality. The game thrashes hard for half an hour as we all fumble with the question of who can see what and who can interact with what.  Bad GMing error here!<br/><br/>Other GMing challenges: <br/><br/>a) with the runners always on the move I can't settle into any NPCs and have to be constantly spawning new ones as the situation demands.  Some kind of Vornheim-style character oracle would be handy.<br/><br/>b) The mechanics decide the pace of revelation, and that's frustrating, because often my ideas were out of sync with the flashback hits.  I'm reluctant to kibitz on ideas about the backstory because the revelation mechanics are so specific and are pointed so firmly away from the GM.  Looking at the Risk sheet there are no "GM has first say" results on the Reveal chart, anyway!  <br/><br/>I think I want to try Psi*Run one more time but I think I might concentrate exclusively on playing the world and the Chasers.  Also, I think I want to tweak it a bit to make psi disasters a little more rare and to make "other player describes flashback" a bit more common.  Maybe move "flashback, other player first say" to 3-5, psi complication to 2-3 and psi disaster to 1? <br/><br/>Thanks to Jackson, Harry, and Ross for letting me experiment with them!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
