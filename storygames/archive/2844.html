We're using an idea of heroes where the heroes come from relationships with the divine pantheons of pagan gods.  Some of the themes of the game are the god's will vs the character's will.  For instance, one of the characters is going to be a Mormon Secret Service agent having to reconcile his faith with the powers that have been bestowed upon him.  Otherwise, we'll be discussing the game and making characters at the table. Let me know if you're interested.  Thanks, -Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
