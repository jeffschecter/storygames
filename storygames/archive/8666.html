Most people know that I think Ron Edward's Big Model describes something both real and useful.  Most people also know that I'm pretty passionate about my own play preferences.  Those two things often color (and sometimes cloud) what I'm trying to say.  So take everything that follows in that context.  Also, some of this is a response to Filip's rampant comments about the state of \u201cStory Games\u201d design.<br/><br/>Back in the day I would go to conventions and see a lot of GURPS games being run.  A chunk of these games had very weird setups that I sometimes describe as, \u201cthe players are psychics scientists controlling battlemechs while fighting dinosaur riding Nazis.\u201d  When I talked to people who played (and seemed to enjoy these games) I reliably got two things out of them.  They thought that system didn't matter.  They claimed they just wanted a good story.<br/><br/>Back then I had never heard Egri's thoughts on Premise and Theme and all I knew was that I'd look at the descriptions of these games and found something lacking with regards to what made a \u201cstory\u201d for me.  So whenever these plays would say, \u201cAll I care about is the story.\u201d  All I could say was, \u201cOkay, but what is all that about?\u201d  And they'd say, \u201cbeing psychic scientists controlling battlemechs while fighting dinosaur riding Nazis.\u201d  And I'd say, \u201cYes, yes, but what is that about!?\u201d  And the conversation would deadlock there because I had no better words.<br/><br/>Of course, what I meant back then was \u201cthe moral problem of human interest the material was addressing.\u201d  You could see that present in my horror games at the time.  I was very fond of the ghosts in the Chill rules because they all came with moral crimes attached to them, \u201cthe wrongfully executed man,\u201d \u201cthe jilted lover\u201d, \u201cthe murdered child\u201d and so on.  Those are the things I would point to say, \u201cThat's what this game is about.\u201d<br/><br/>What I hadn't figured out when I discovered The Forge is that I could raise those issues without simultaneously front-loading an answer.  I was a firm believer that Theme was something delivered from the GM to the players as a kind of lesson.  Thus I was mired in The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast: How do you let the players make meaningful decisions but still retain authorship of the moral message of the story.  Answer: You don't.<br/><br/>When I saw games like Sorcerer and My Life with Master and Dust Devils I had a thought which, I'll fully admit, was rooted in my personal arrogance.  I was completely convinced those weird GURPS driven \u201cpsychic scientists controlling battlemechs while fighting dinosaur riding Nazis\u201d would die out.  I assumed that those games were created by frustrated attempts at \u201cstory\u201d and with increasing lack of actual story satisfaction the players had layered on more and more and more and more color to have \u201cfun.\u201d<br/><br/>What I thought we'd see is the hobby split in two.  One camp would further refine Story Now and the other camp would refine Step On Up.  I was convinced The Right To Dream would die off.  I thought this because I used to think that The Right To Dream was created over time as a compromise between a poorly articulated Creative Agenda clash between the other two.  And now that we had ways of designing for the other two clearly there was no longer any need for that frustrated compromise.<br/><br/>Well, turns out I was wrong.  Turns out there really ARE people who like fantasizing about being \u201cpsychic scientists controlling battlemech while fighting dinosaur riding Nazis\u201d for its own sake.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191701/#Comment_191701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T13:46:34+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  1:46PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 1:50PM by Jesse.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The above is all background to preface the substance of what I'm about to say.  Please don't get caught up in agreeing/disagreeing with it.  It's purely a personal account of my RPG development.<br/><br/>The problem is that the first wave of \u201cindie\u201d games was created by frustrated and disgruntled Story Now motivated people who were dissatisfied with the content of their games and built techniques and rules to help generate that content.  What then happened is that these games were discovered by people motived by The Right To Dream.  However, there's a key distinction between the first group and the second group.  The second group was not dissatisfied with the content of their play.  They were only dissatisfied with the process of their play.  Effectively, they were tired of having to calculate the armor piercing coefficient of their battlemech relative to the thickness factor of the dinosaur's hide when all they wanted to do was have their battlemech tear the dinosaur's head off.<br/><br/>So basically, fueled by the revelation that you don't NEED abilities, skills, to hit rolls, defense rolls and equipment lists in an RPG the second group co-opted the techniques created by the first group and tried to apply them to the Creative Agenda of the second group.  Here's the thing to remember: Creative Agenda is independent of System.  System matters (not dictates) in facilitating the realization of a Creative Agenda of the group.  In some sense the new phrase should be System ONLY Matters (not Only System Matters).  Since these people are already adept at achieving The Right To Dream these techniques appeared to \u201cwork.\u201d  And they probably \u201cworked better\u201d largely because of their low handling time.<br/><br/>So here's my bold claim: all those techniques developed from a Story Now aesthetic are horribly sub-optimal for achieving The Right To Dream.  The evidence for that is spread out all over our online culture.  The confusion over Stakes from in-fiction conflicts to clashing player desires.  Relationship maps from being about sex and blood to more or less social networks of every fictional component in the game.  Hell the very need to create this weird term \u201cStory Game\u201d to describe things.<br/><br/>In particular Stakes Setting combined with One-Roll Resolution is very destructive to The Right To Dream.  Those two things in combination are most useful when at every point of doubt in the fiction there's a moral pivot point that will be thematically altered either way the dice fall.  But when the battlemechs come cresting over the hill to crush the Nazis base camp....<br/><br/>That's it.  That's all there is.  Setting the Stakes as \u201cdo we crush the Nazi base camp?\u201d doesn't make a lot of sense because NOT crushing the Nazi base camp seems kind of lame (I'm assuming there's a general table consensus that this is the climax).  And trying to force Stakes like \u201cDo I impress Susan during the battle\u201d seems awkward and forced when the cool part is when my battlemech tears the head off the dinosaur.  You need a tool that focuses on those awesome imaginative moments rather than one  designed to weight emotional pivot points about a character's thematic issue.<br/><br/>What we need (and I can't believe I'M the one saying this) is those people to re-assert, so to speak, Their Right To Dream.  We need a Right To Dream Renaissance on the same scale that Story Now got at The Forge or that's happening in the movement calling itself the Old-School Renaissance.  There are places where I can see the budding techniques for this Renaissance housed.<br/><br/>I point to Sons of Liberty.  While I think the game is overall competitive I think the idea of \u201cwhat you say is what happens\u201d is a valuable one to study.  I point to Trail of Cthulhu who's beautiful \u201cHow you play this game\u201d lays out the imaginative structure of play more clearly than anything I've ever seen.  I point to Ron's comments about Dead of Night.    <br/><br/>Seriously, if your game really is about making up cool stuff for its own sake then let's brainstorm some techniques and mechanics that make that a fun and easy thing to do.  Which is all System has ever been: A process for making what you already are committed to doing, a fun an easy thing to do.  Let's have a little critical thinking and honesty about what it is you REALLY want to be doing and see designs that reflect those thoughts.  Let's stop dropping stakes, and traits and relationships and conflict resolution into games that they are wholly inappropriate and awkward for just because that's what the \u201ccool kids\u201d are doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191707/#Comment_191707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T14:36:42+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  2:36PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 2:36PM by DevP.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can definitely see this, and I think there's a number of players seeking better techniques for this kind of Sim/Dream.

I also agree that stakes likely won't work as the basis for resolution in such games for the same reason you suggest. <br/><br/>However, I disagree to the extent that your argument implies that the tools and techniques being used by Story Now games cannot be adapted for effective simulationsit design (e.g., Committee's expedition log).

Its also worth noting that the ways and whys of how he is right fall right into the reasons you've said you have problems with SoTC in the past. Those things that reinforce your right of dream instead of urging you to address theme? Yea. <br/><br/>Also, many trad games do this better than you might think. I mean, I know we like to talk shit about how much they suck, but in many cases they don't. They just sucked for what we wanted to do with them (which isn't what they were supposed to do), or because they assumed we had skills we didn't (which is a failure of communication and pedagogy, but not inherently a failure of design.) So, you know, going back and re-examining some of those suck ass trad games that don't work but that tens of thousands of people continue to play regularly may be worth some time, regardless of what Filip may feel. <br/><br/>The other thing about those evil trad games is that, as you've noted in the past, often the magic isn't in the game, but in the players. Many "trad" players have highly developed systems (in the lumpley sense, not the mechanics in the book sense) and skill sets that allow them to make games functional and even brilliant. So it might be worth, you know, going and talking to players of Sim games that have worked and trying to understand the systematic underpinnings of what they're already doing, and have been doing successfully for 30 some years in some cases. <br/><br/>Sure, it will be frustrating and difficult, as we've no joint language and have spent the last 8 years pissing on each other... but... I mean, I know that this is Story Games and all the right thinking and intelligent gamers on earth are here and only here, but um... I think we risk reinventing the wheel and falling to our own biases (which, as you point out, we've already done in many areas) if we don't try to talk to folks who are doing it already.<br/><br/>Oh, and while we're at it I'd like to suggest that we also pay attention to the differences in ways we go about doing this as designers making games vs players playing games. Because, you know, they aren't always the same and the sometimes lopsided emphasis we put on one or the other may well cripple us in this area. But that may be asking for too much all at once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191732/#Comment_191732" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T17:41:09+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  5:41PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 5:43PM by J_Walton.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that was more Forge-speak than I've seen at SG in a while.<br/><br/>Also, dude, Jesse we're already doing it. Just in places you're not looking and maybe in styles of play that you might not enjoy.  And we don't call it "the dream renaissance" or anything that sounds like GNS, because we're hopefully growing more sophisticated (and diverse) in our understanding of our own tastes and those of others. And, maybe, y'know, the folks that are pioneering interesting Sim stuff (and stuff that's not easily confined to a single GNS category) aren't publishing games in print and distributing them using the methods used by a lot of Forge games.  Doesn't mean it's not happening. Like Brand semi-implies, maybe those folks are happily playing their games and not primarily focused on sharing their techniques with other folks on the internet.<br/><br/>My sense of all this is that you can't force a design movement to exist where there isn't one.  Design fads come and go.  You just have to toil on the stuff that really interests you in the hopes that someday it'll interest other folks too.  Be the change and all that.<br/><br/>P.S. If I had to, I'd probably classify Jeepform stuff as Nar, but it's WAY different than Forge stuff. Likewise, there is Sim stuff going on that is WAY different from anything we're doing. Online freeform is a big one, since fanfic-style reveling in someone else's world is a major Sim market. There's probably some really fascinating design stuff going on there too, except, like, the folks doing it don't even think about it as design, don't write it down, and certainly don't publish it in any form we would encounter.<br/><br/>P.P.S.  Sorry for the bit of snark, but I feel like I've been toiling in the desert on non-Nar design stuff since 2005, and so have several other very cool folks.

I've seen it used as an example of Sim, but I haven't seen any analyses of how it does Sim well or poorly.  Maybe there just isn't that much interest here.  Or, who knows, maybe times are changing?

I actually followed this thread pretty closely yesterday but held off on responding to process a little more carefully WHY I'm saying what I'm saying.<br/><br/>In perfect world, games would be treated individualistically.  In fact I see a lot of threads over at RPG.net that say things like, "Help Me Sell My Group on Story Games" and my answer is always the same: "Don't.  Find a few games you like, and see if any of them spark their interest as well."  So yes, we SHOULD treat and evaluate games one at a time relative to our own play preferences.<br/><br/>But the practicalities of reality are that human beings are pattern recognition machines.  I don't know why but we like grouping like things together.  Perhaps it has something to do with primal tribal urges or something.  My issue is that culturally the algorithm underlying the pattern is broken.  And yes, I'm speaking about internet culture but I'm fairly certain that it extends at least one layer out from that into non-internet participating members who associate with the participating members.<br/><br/>To lump Sorcerer and The Committee For The Exploration of Mysteries and My Life with Master and Dead of Night all into the same category as "Story Games" or even "Indie Games" is to do a disservice to all of them.  It muddies the conversation about what makes each of them great.  Worse, it's created a sort of marketing meme where if you have attributes and skills you're traditional and if you have stakes, traits and relationships you're a story/indie game.<br/><br/>We're back to where we started where people aren't looking at what creative purpose the games serve and are just looking at the building blocks.  As I said I badly mangled my point in the beginning.  I over emphasized the historical development of techniques vs their lazy application.<br/><br/>I don't share Filip's bizarre hatred of "trad" games.  I agree more with Brand in that their faults lie in their unstated assumptions and poorly articulated processes.  However, I do agree with Filip that critical thought and self-reflection that made Dogs in the Vineyard and My Life with Master great has eroded in favor a poisonous "Story Game" meme.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191913/#Comment_191913" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T13:05:02+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  1:05PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2009 1:10PM by J_Walton.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, the "story game as generic noun" meme is poisonous, totally.  So here's the thing: stop using it and maybe other people will too.  That's my approach.  Story Games is a website.  What we make are "games," period.  Some of them have roleplaying elements, some have storytelling elements, some have board game or card game elements, but none of them are somehow defined by "story" (what an amorphous concept that is). Whatever good Clinton was trying to do by calling them "story games" has long since been killed by people using it to mean "games I like" or "games published by a specific group of designers" or "progressive roleplaying games" (with the value judgment inherent in 'progressive').<br/><br/>P.S. The other thing, and this comes from my experience with The Forge, is that you can't control the ways in which folks you don't really know talk about you or what you do.  Remember when "Forge games" was a thing and people used to talk about them as a collective entity?  Ha!  So it doesn't at all surprise me that folks on RPGnet or whatever see "story games" as this distinct category of related things.  But we know better, right?  At least, we should.  And hopefully they will too, over time, as they keep encountering really different games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191919/#Comment_191919" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T13:15:51+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  1:15PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.P.S.

I've been designing two Sim games that I love the heck out of:  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/inde/btw/SUPER_ACTION_NOW_3.htm" rel="nofollow">Super Action Now!</a> and <i>Hex Rangers</i> (formerly known as <i>Witch Trails</i>).<br/><br/>Both of these are informed and influenced heavily by Narrativistic games that introduced a lot of fancy new shiny stuff that made my brain go BZZZ!.  In particular, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> was a big deal, even though I hadn't read it at all at the time I created those two games, and still haven't played it, and was even wrong about a few things it did.  SAN! uses freeform traits ranked in dice, like Dogs.  HR uses an extended conflict resolution mechanic based on poker, like Dogs.  SAN! also has other Forgish features like shared GMing, collaborative scene setting, and one-roll.<br/><br/>My point here is that those techniques can be made to serve the Right to Dream.  You just have to be careful about it.<br/><br/>Lemme talk about SAN! for a bit.  It's subtitle is "a crazy-ass roleplaying game."  And that's what it's about:  madcap surreal farce.  If you've seen the cartoon <i>Chowder</i>, and the weirder episodes of <i>SpongeBob Squarepants</i>, and the weirder <i>Looney Tunes</i>, and <i>Naked Gun</i>, and <i>Mr. Bean's Holiday</i>, it's kinda like that, except weirder.  <br/><br/>This is the structure of the game:<br/>Everyone creates a crazy-ass character.  There are no limitations to what this character is or does.  You give him a Drive, a Knack (really really specific task that you succeed at 99% of the time), a Shortcoming (something you fail at 99% of the time), and a bunch of traits and powers that are ranked arbitrarily by dice.  You have Drive Points, which fuel powers and allow you to ignore Inconveniece (damage, except it's funny), and you replenish them by pursuing your Drive.<br/><br/>Everyone has a pile of TILT! points.  You spend these to do stuff like add traits to things, introduce new things to a scene out of the blue, introduce unexpected twists ("I hide under the bed!" "TWIST!  There's an alligator under the bed!"), force a player to change his announced action, and so on.  Basically, you tilt the game and make sure it stays crazy.  You replenish your TILT! by making people laugh.  Everytime one of your contributions to the game makes someone laugh, you get a point.<br/><br/>We have a hat, into which we put various suggestions, objects, and events that we might like to see in the game.<br/><br/>We establish how our characters are related.<br/><br/>We frame a scene collaboratively, by each of us adding one element to it in turn (drawing from the hat if we wish), until we feel like it's ready.<br/><br/>We take turns describing what our characters (or any NPCs we wish to grab hold of) do.  We pursue our character's Drives, while screwing over each other's characters relentlessly -- through our own characters, through NPCs, and by using TILT!.  When two characters act against each other, we describe what they're doing and roll the dice granted by their traits, and compare results.  The better result wins, and the loser gets Inconvenienced for his trouble.  (Inconvenience requires that you either spend Drive to ignore it, or do something to get rid of it)<br/><br/>When the scene is functionally over, we frame a new one.  Lather, rinse, repeat, until our sides ache from laughing and we can't go on any longer.<br/><br/>So, here's what that all is:  an instrument for creating and developing a crazy-ass situation.  Everything in it is meant for that, and works.  F'rinstance, the freeform traits work because I can invoke bad-ass biker bastard Bubba Bad's traits "Bad to the Bone" and "Born to be wild," combine them with his power "Inadvisable motorcycle jump," and use that as my dice pool against my opponent, to try to ramp up the mall's escalator, fly over the troupe of girlscouts, and get the magical sword from the vendor's stand before my opponent does.  <br/><br/>I had more to say but I'm running out of time.  Perhaps later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192018/#Comment_192018" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T21:19:41+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  9:19PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Jonathan and I are two white guys who like playing games, but that's where our interests and ideas part ways, but sometimes we're totally on the same wavelength. Violently. So if it's ok, I want to back up some things he stated.\n<blockquote>Jesse, the "story game as generic noun" meme is poisonous, totally. So here's the thing: stop using it and maybe other people will too.</blockquote>\nYeah, pretty much. It's hard, because people want to discuss some games that have similar conventions to games that come out of the Forge mindset. In short? Role-playing games where you have more on your sheet than your character's attributes, skills, weapons and equipment. That's pretty much the "boiled down difference" that many people want to point to but can't find the words for. It went from "Forge Game" to (some people using) "Story Game", but in the end it seems that it's more like this "More Than Attributes, Skills, Weapons and Equipment" (MASEW games? Yech).<br/><br/>I'm going to reverse the next part:\n<blockquote>Whatever good Clinton was trying to do by calling them "story games" has long since been killed by people using it to mean "games I like" or "games published by a specific group of designers" or "progressive roleplaying games" (with the value judgment inherent in 'progressive').</blockquote>\nYes. Unfortunately, no better term has come out, so people use what they can to talk about what they want to talk about...\n<blockquote>Story Games is a website. What we make are "games," period.</blockquote>\nAnd this (pending updating the Wiki) is The Final Answer. Story Games is a website, story-games.com, where people can come to talk about Role-Playing Games (rather than board, card console, PC, etc; unless the discussion whips back to RPGs). The talk tends to be centered on small press games, and those "More than just Attributes, Skills Weapons and Equipment" games ("Hippy Games", etc), but that's not what it's limited to. <br/><br/>Cause honestly, if I could make up a category that excluded GURPS and Warhammer yet included Blue Planet, Hellas, Dogs in the Vineyard, Barbarians of Lemuria, Dust Devils, Dirty Secrets and Dread (hell, BOTH the RPGs named "Dread"), then the first thing I would do is close this site and get LOTS of money by becoming a government contractor and doing redistricting for municipalities and schools. I could probably write my own checks. But I can't, and sides I don't want to.<br/><br/>I'd change Jonathan's thing to "we make are role-playing games, period." (cause that's what we kinda focus on here, although sure a lot of folks are doing board and card games too). \n<blockquote>P.P.S. Are you also lamenting the dearth of new design concepts? Because it seems like you are. There was definitely a time when I looked at all of the new games coming out and said, yeah, "conflict resolution, stakes, traits representing beliefs and emotions, scene framing guidelines, endgame, YAWN" but I hope that time has finally passed us by. Honestly, I think things are heading in many more exciting directions.</blockquote>\nHoly crap, yeah. I was as guilty of this as anyone as well. But like Jonathan says, it's not something to like get all bound up about: It was a "phase" that a lot of designers from that Forge background went through (just like pushing untested/unfinished games, etc). Actually, add in "this game uses lots of various dice, and you manipulate them in weird ways to get all sorts of story/game effects". But there was tons of other things going on as well (again, the first edition of Dread came out before the Hippy Glut of 2003-2005). And there is now, too.<br/><br/>I have on my shelf some games I've really got my fingers into these days: Empire of Dust. Nine Worlds. Dread: TFBOP. Hellas. Barbarians of Lemuria. Vampire the Requiem. Story Cards. Some J-RPGs. (these are just in my current mindspace: Ask me in half a year, and some of them will be different) If every element of the hobby exploded tomorrow, and not a soul was left to even post their free Final Fantasy RPG Notes on their blog, there's enough variance and thoughtful design in that list to carry me to my grave without being the slightest bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The Internet is all about the New, as Fast as Possible: But really, with some of the groundwork we've seen laid in the past few years, I've seen and will expect to see really interesting Games (ok, Role Playing Games) come out for the foreseeable future: Many are hard core adventure games (because that's personally what I'm really into, more or less), but they're changing and growing, and doing it without having to go back to the Forge to ask "How can I make Sim better?"<br/><br/>BTW Jesse, I agree with your opening posts, except for the conclusion that I'm seeing which is "it's up to <b>US</b> to do something!" (at least, that's what I'm seeing in that last bit). Rather, I see it being done, by itself. Some of these folks doing it do recognize influence from The Fringe, others don't. But it's happening. My involvement pretty much ends with "It's up to ME! ...<i> to see what's coming out, and pick those games that look interesting to me.</i>"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192020/#Comment_192020" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T21:29:07+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  9:29PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2009 10:11PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Seriously, if your game really is about making up cool stuff for its own sake then let's brainstorm some techniques and mechanics that make that a fun and easy thing to do.</blockquote>\nI'd love to talk about the techniques my game <b>Delve</b> uses, which include:<br/>1) characters can "read" a problematic scenario with tarot cards, giving the players vague info on possible solutions<br/>2) players use a dial to indicate their desired pace and level of detail to the GM, moment to moment<br/>3) formal mechanics are all applied by the GM; players' only contact is knowing that a high die roll is "good performance by their character's standards" and a low roll is "poor performance"<br/>4) character and player knowledge is kept as close together as possible<br/>5) content authority is "what would happen"<br/>6) all fictional content impacting resolution is established before resolution<br/>7) a major reward component is positioning within the setting's social structure<br/><br/><b>Sign in Stranger</b> uses some fascinating techniques:<br/>1) basic situation is given (first humans to explore new planet, must do task for natives, learn useful stuff for humans)<br/>2) specific situation arises from establishing setting<br/>3) setting is established as stimuli only, without any "how"s or "why"s stated<br/>4) stimuli are prompted by secret random draws from piles of nouns, verbs, and adjectives<br/><br/>Obviously, I likes me some setting-heavy Sim.

I'm not sure what to say.  Personally, I wouldn't want somebody to point to the most dysfunctional parts of the indie games scene and assume that was me, y'know?</blockquote>\n...is spot on. <br/><br/>To put to post what Jon was insinuating, I'll point you to old threads on The Forge in a heartbeat where we see a bunch of guys who by their own accounts elsewhere don't even play roleplaying games much (or at all) anymore, discussing the finer points of some nuance of abstract game theory at a level both "academic" and "wanky". If those forums were still active today, we'd see those discussions still happen once a month or once a week, even. Does that mean that all those Forge guys are folks who talk design obsessively because they can't find a group to play with anymore? Well, that's exactly what it looks like to the folks who happen to stumble upon that one monthly thread where those four guys post over and over. Likewise, extrapolating the same thing from RPGNet... shit, the only thing that I'd agree with and wouldn't simply scream "Logical Fallacy of Converse Accident!" from a post sampling at the RPGNet forums is, "Wow, seems like lots of people like Exalted and D&amp;D".<br/><br/>But, that was a whole side-topic. I didn't really want to see it taken too much further here, but if folks want to talk about that on their blogs, feel free to post a link to your entry here.\n<blockquote>Oh, wait. I forgot you're a troll.</blockquote>\nSo, I think this bit has already been covered in the Community Moderation thread, but just in case anyone was curious:<br/><br/>Sure, JD repeats a lot of bon mots, dances on Brain Damage, and comes from a background dominated by WoD. But beyond that, people are reading too far into him, like at the "identity politics" level. He fucking plays these games (hippie, trad, whatever) as "us", more so than most posters here, and comes up with mountains of useful information in the form of actual play advice and the like on them. If this website exploded and everyone left for something better, and all that was left behind was like me, JD, and Five Completely Random Gamers, I'd still be happy here. In fact, I've made several wild exaggerations with that kernel of truth, like "I'd ban myself before I'd ban Poster X" and the like.<br/><br/>He is <i>not</i> a troll. I've seen him accused of that before, and in each case it was in a thread with a lot of heat, and by someone who were either themselves trolling (without realizing it), or simply worked up about an idea to the point that they were being set off by disagreement. Just wanted to clear that up.<br/><br/>Aaaaaaaanyway, sorry for the ModCock in the thread. I'm hoping we can calm down and continue onwards with the OP, which is an interesting but admittedly divisive topic (not because of Jesse, but because of the ideas he presents).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192029/#Comment_192029" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T22:32:46+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 10:32PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 12:02AM by Number6intheVillage.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>You're the one saying that thousands of people play games they aren't happy with, and I'm the one that's supposed to produce evidence for my view?

Right, an instrument.<br/><br/>The Right to Dream is a Creative Agenda.  "Creative Agenda" is exactly what its name implies; creativity is part of Sim just as much as it is part of Nar and Gam.  As with all creative exercises, you need an instrument.  To play music, you need guitars or drums or bassoons or whatever.  To paint a picture, you need a brush and paint.  In gaming, your instrument is the game.<br/><br/>In Sim, the basic point is creating, building, exploring, and/or developing something with your friends.  Because doing that is <i>fun</i>.  In that way, the Right to Dream is a lot like model trains:  you put together a track and watch the train go because (assuming you have knowledge of and appreciation for model trains) it's fun.  Sim is very sincere and endearing in this regard; the attitude is very much "Hey, look at this cool thing we made!" and that's why I love it.<br/><br/>So, that's what your instrument needs to do:  allow you to create/build/explore/develop that Something.<br/><br/>In designing your Dreaming instrument, you have to identify what that Something is.  You have to be very clear about it in your head.  What is part of it?  What is definitely not part of it?  What merely might be part of it, if you want it?  The next step is to think, "Well, how do I get there?"<br/><br/>SAN!'s Something is a crazy-ass, farcical situation that starts fairly simple and gets progressively crazier until it can't get no crazier (at which point usually the planet blows up, The End).  To give ya some Forgespeak, it's High Concept Sim with emphasis on Situation, with Color being a close second (Setting, Character, and System are certainly also important, but in support roles.  We don't really care about your character in SAN! except in how he develops the Situation and Color, and the mechanics exist for no other purpose at all). It gets there through these core rules:<br/><br/>1. Create a wacky character<br/>2. Pursue your character's agenda<br/>3. Screw with the other players<br/><br/>That's it.  All the mechanics are there to give you creative opportunities to follow those rules.<br/><br/>The TILT! economy deserves special mention, because it is a constraint.  A sort of Dream Enforcement mechanic, if you will.  It makes sure that we're all after the same Something.  See, the reward in this game isn't when you get a TILT! chip, it's when you laugh with your friends.  Earning TILT! is not a reward mechanic, it is a <i>punishment</i> mechanic -- if you aren't funny, you run out of TILT! chips, and the amount of impact you can have on the Dream is severely marginalized, meaning that you can't ruin it.  It might seem mean, but having your Dream ruined by someone who wasn't on the same page can really fuck up your day (imagine that you put together a model train set, and then someone accidentally broke it while playing with it).  Plus, it's sneaky about it, and thus a lot more comfortable than the GM telling you that you "obviously have no idea how to play your character."<br/><br/>I've been looking at Rafael Chandler's <i>Dread</i> (and, goddammit, trying to get some play going, but scheduling is a stone bitch), and I love the way it Gets There.  Based on my readings, I'd identify it as a High Concept Sim, also with emphasis on Situation and Color.  Character and Setting are also VERY important, but in support roles:  they provide backdrops and generation-engines for Situation and Color.  System exists purely to get Color into play and move the Situation gradually to its close; it's not Explored for its own sake.<br/><br/>So, how does it Get There?<br/>Let's start with Color.  First off, nobody who even flips through the rulebook is going to have any doubt about what kind of Color is appropriate.  Beyond that, the marvelous constraint (Dream Enforcement) of the character generation.  Ohmygod it's so damned elegant and focused and fuckin' SHARP.  Follow those rules, and you can't fail to make a Color-generating <i>machine</i>.  I know that with the character I've created for our upcoming game, I won't have to work at all; all I gotta do is listen to him and try to keep up.<br/><br/>As far as Situation, the demons rock on toast.  They're practically ready-made situations all by themselves.  Place them like a transparency over Setting, socket in the PCs, and BAM. It goes like this:  <br/>1. Demon does some stuff; explore ramifications<br/>2. Disciples find out and start looking for it; explore ramifications<br/>3. People in the setting are doing stuff that intersects 1 and 2; explore ramifications<br/>4. Gradually bring ramifications to a head as the demon nears its goal, and as the Disciples gradually close in on and face down the demon; stir the mixture up and see if it explodes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192178/#Comment_192178" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T20:13:39+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  8:13PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So unless I'm missing something here isn't Baron Munchausen absolutely sim?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192260/#Comment_192260" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T09:25:36+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  9:25AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            100% sim, Tulpa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192496/#Comment_192496" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T14:25:35+00:00" title="February 13, 2009  2:25PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I thought.

I think that you have a narrativist game with some mirror-world sim ideas in it.

It is never about addressing a theme. It is entirely about telling stories in a world of 17th century decadence. Addressing a moral quandary and how it relates to the human condition, challenging your beliefs, that doesn't belong in the game and you would be adding that yourself. In addition to a challenge being seen as fun and cool for upsetting expectation it should also fit within the context of the aesthetic setting your group has established.<br/><br/>If you're playing Baron Munchausen, and someone says "I wager the french diplomat pulls out a cell phone and warns napoleon about you." The wager would not be seen as fun and cool even though it is unexpected, it would be seen as a damaging interruption to the game. In this way it is not calvinball.

But the more I consider it, the more convincing the arguments in this thread become.  The funny thing is, I can totally see the Step On Up crowd (in deference to Jesse) making an argument with similar force about the rules really being about issuing challenges on certain fair terms, and overcoming them!  Maybe Munchausen isn't enough system to matter. Sorry that I contributed to hijacking the thread like this.<br/><br/>Say, how about these innovative techniques for Dream in these new games, which are cool toys for designers and players alike?  In particular, there was some talk at the beginning about innovative techniques disjoint from the recent advances in Story Now-facilitating design.  Some talk about The Committee For The Exploration of Mysteries (about which I have heard nothing) and SotC (about which I'm intensely curious) and some other stuff.
