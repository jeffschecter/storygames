That's not the point. The point is that the female character is doing it and if doing it should be a dramatic challenge, then we can worry about it.

The only related frustration being well meaning GMs/players trying to keep a game historically accurate.  If some players are being awesome in a game, other players don't want to just be the 'furniture' to 'bounce' off of, just because it will make things "historically accurate".  So the attitude stated above, alternative history and Girl Genius is exactly why I like Steampunk, but dislike playing a historically accurate Victorian game.  Gaming is about imagination and having fun for everyone involved; and the ignorance of the past should be ignored while playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384067/#Comment_384067" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-01T19:35:25+00:00" title="July  1, 2012  7:35PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slliska, if these are the experiences you've had...great.<br/><br/>This is what we want to see from the hobby.<br/><br/>The problem echoed across G+, and numerous other gamer related forums (console and tabletop) over the past week or two indicate that there is still a widespread mysogyny and a sexist undercurrent across the hobby.

I've only had one slightly sexist boss, yet I got the better of him from day one and that was when I was a very naive college kid.  Otherwise I've never encountered anything negative, if anything men were actually pleased there was a female around for a different perspective on things, and to break up the monotony,  as long as that person was really there because she was interested.  By that I mean, I wasn't someone's "drug along for the ride air-head girlfriend" who was bored and just killing time, but instead I was usually more into the game (board, RPG, video, cards) than most people there, and I chose to be there.  <br/><br/>This started long ago when I was a kid, and now days I run game rooms and mini conventions where I coordinate GMs, almost all of them are male.  I chalk up the mostly male table top gamers to some of the same reasons IT positions are overwhelmingly held by males, there are reasons but nothing misogynic/sexist/underhanded/or otherwise wrong, and some day this will balance out more.  However, I'm aware that female gamers for console/video and online/computer games are going strong and it's almost a 50/50 gender split at this time, I also used to be one.  So I'm a little incredulous that anyone could be so ignorant as to be threatened by females interested in their hobby, and be misogynic or sexist now days, when I've never seen it in the past.  <br/><br/>However, if it happens, and isn't just being flirty or banter btwn fellow gamers, this is wrong and should be stopped.  I applaud your support to try to stop this poor behavior and encourage more positive behavior, I just have never experienced anything except what I described above, which was well meaning but trying to be historically accurate.                              </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384072/#Comment_384072" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-01T22:42:51+00:00" title="July  1, 2012 10:42PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This offends me more than actual Nazis.
