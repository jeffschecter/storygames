B1 (In Search of the Unknown) is weird and very self-contained (don't expect it to make sense as it is - it's just a dungeon crawl) but pretty fun.

Or, more accurately, the "B" series covers levels 1-3, just like the Basic Set does.<br/><br/>My (completely biased) reviews:<br/><br/>B1: In Search of the Unknown. Avoid, unless you're specifically looking to push your player's nostalgia buttons. C-.<br/>B2: Keep on the Borderlands. A classic, but perhaps overused. B+.<br/>B3: Palace of the Silver Princess. Wacky and kind of loveable. If you look around, I bet you can find the original, unpublished, even wackier version as a PDF! A.<br/>B4: The Lost City. Atmospheric, and expandable to an entire "Lost City" campaign, if that's your cuppa. A.<br/>B5: Horror on the Hill. In some ways, a wilderness + dungeon slog. But it has some nice stuff, and has been surprisingly well thought out. I'm rather fond of it. B+.<br/>B6: The Veiled Society. In theory, a great sandboxy murder mystery. I could never figure out how to, you know, actually play it. C-.<br/>B7: Rahasia. Oozing with atmosphere, but some annoying bits (the teleportation thing is there just to make mapping harder). C+.<br/>B8: Journey to the Rock. Really kind of terrible, unless you are playing with ten-year-olds for whom this kind of thing is new and exciting. That's how old I was when I played it, and it was AWESOME. C+.<br/>B9: Castle Caldwell and Beyond. A series of dungeon crawls, each less interesting than the last.

It comes with a bunch of fold-up paper cottages and stand-up character counters for running a dramatic chase scene through a dense urban neighbourhood, but since the route of the chase is fixed (no alleys or crossroads, just a single long crooked street) and the resolution of the chase is largely pre-scripted, using these props is not a challenge so much as a bit of puppetry. Its also an early example of a big authority figure demanding a mission of the party, giving them limited resources to do it, yet paradoxically employing vast resources to force the PC's onto the job.

The crazy map fascinated me as a child and the fact that I had to select encounters really helped me get into GMing.<br/><br/>You know, this is interesting. I love B1, and loathe B2. I am also of the generation before the Basic D&amp;D generation - I came in with Holmes, which originally was packaged with B1 but changed to B2 once B2 existed.<br/><br/>I think B1 is much more a "0e" little-books style adventure, firmly Gygaxian, dungeon-centric, and focused on player skill. It is one kind of "old school D&amp;D".<br/><br/>B2 is very different. It's made up mini-dungeons arranged in such a way that the players can pick and choose what to engage with IF they do some scouting. It has a framing device that presumes the PCs are disposed to do good - or at least take requests from authority figures. It has a very different feel to me, one that's much more in the fantasy adventure vein and less in the small-unit tactics with thin veneer of fantasy color that I identify with MY early-D&amp;D experience.<br/><br/>The "old school" truly is vast and contains multitudes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361199/#Comment_361199" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T15:37:27+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  3:37PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true. <br/><br/>FWIW I am of the generation that came in with Moldvay's Basic, so later but still identify my early D&amp;D experiences with the style in B1, more than B2.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
