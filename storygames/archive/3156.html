The question is how have these (or other modifications, and please share them) worked out in your games? They seem to go well with more lethal styles and campaigns on paper, but I would like to hear some experiences. <br/><br/>Is there any information how the system will be in Dresden files? <br/><br/>As a side note, I myself use the shorter stress track (three box base) and the \xe2\u20ac\u201c2, -4 and -6 coincidences, but we have not hit any coincidences yet as the players basically have gone through the minions till now. I also have been using more powerful minions (most being fair and some going to great quality).   <br/><br/><br/>The reason for the thought in first place: <br/>I have been enthralled by the Fate 3 (SotC) system, most directly by the Chase rules, easy skill use and the all-prevalent Aspects. These sound nice things to use in more mundane campaigns also, with more mundane characters being easier to advance later, therefore giving more for those players looking to Augment their characters rules wise. <br/><br/>On this premise I have thought to bonder things like less stunts (two have worked well in our Crimson Skies game) and maybe either rename some skill levels (superb being too strong term for the peak skill for mundane character) or to start the pyramid from great level. In this premise the wounding strikes should be more common, therefore need for more \xe2\u20ac\u0153deadly\xe2\u20ac\x9d system. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Deadly\xe2\u20ac\x9d being somewhat misleading term as I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t usually want the danger be <i>lethal</i>, but <i>injuring</i> and feel like <i>deadly</i>. For example I would like to use Hollow Earth Expedition game setting with SotC rules. The battle with dinosaurs should be potentially lethal yes, but the combat against natives and the Nazis should be <i>injuring</i>, not immediately <i>lethal</i>, which is nicely done by the usual Conceding option. With beasts the conceding is usually not option, as the Dinosaur will most certainly devour the losing character, if the character is not conceding by some relocation, like carried away by river or similar..                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72044/#Comment_72044" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T10:22:11+00:00" title="May 27, 2007 10:22AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been playing that a hit that's off your stress track is a "taken out" result and cannot be mitigated by taking a consequence.

With the Halfjack\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u0153taken out\xe2\u20ac\x9d by off track hit system it could be good to have some length for the track, maybe the three plus additional from suitable skill. With most characters this would mean four or five boxes. In this the consequences could be taken with \xe2\u20ac\u201c2, -4 and \xe2\u20ac\u201c6 modifications. <br/><br/>Alternatively the base could be one base box, with additional from suitable skill, meaning basically that the first hit or two are grazes and the off-track hits could be softened by consequences, which would come in question almost immediately. <br/><br/>In example we could consider professional soldier, noble native with spear or similar. The minion could be thought to be fair quality, at least if combat is the conflict in question. With some air or preparation there should be one Aspect tag in work, therefore the attack could be something in range from great [+4]. The average defensive skill for Superb skill pyramid could be thought to be Good [+3], with the Endurance being Average [+1]. <br/><br/>Therefore the Stress track would be marked, with average defensive roll of [+0], as the first box. In first system the marked box would leave three unmarked to right. In second system the marked box would leave one unmarked to right. As player you would see small rise of danger in first situation, but nothing immediately threatening his/her control of damage countering. In second case the danger seems to be more immediate, but the real life threat would not have risen. <br/><br/>With weapon that does two Boxes of damage the situation would somewhat change, with both cases considering the consequence I think. In the second case the possibility to lessen damage in future attacks by minor consequence is non-existing, even if the multiple box damage weapon is removed. Therefore it should be valid to take the minor consequence now.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72050/#Comment_72050" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T11:37:13+00:00" title="May 27, 2007 11:37AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one vision of more \xe2\u20ac\u0153deadly\xe2\u20ac\x9d SotC is the case of character in some study, doing some infiltration thing, hand coming from the closet and BANG, character put down. At first the best thing seems to be to hand out a fate point and say \xe2\u20ac\u0153you were sneak attacked\xe2\u20ac\x9d. The hope in GM point of view would be to relatively safe way but the character down, if he/she turns the FP down, with the character having relatively slim change to win the short confrontation. In best case there in concedement with the narrative right for the player to plant some evidence the assailer left behind. The second would be the same situation other way around, with Named Villain trying to take the pullet and still be standing. <br/><br/>The pure damage presentation / implementation system naturally being a alternative here to the primary FP run GM fiat. Alternatively the situation could be true lethal trap, not present as character players knowing about the danger and hopefully also the player controlling the ambushed character sweating to wait the imminent attack. I would think that one in four change of survival in this \xe2\u20ac\u0153lethal trap\xe2\u20ac\x9d situation would be nice, with use of creativity (and FP) rising the odds to something like three cases in four.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72052/#Comment_72052" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T12:12:04+00:00" title="May 27, 2007 12:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tonpa</cite><br/>The basic way to make the combat more deadly seems to be the shortening the Stress track and the \xe2\u20ac\u201c2, -4 and -6 coincidence house rule, maybe with the addition of minion style stress.

Group, this method don't make combat deadlier, it just make it faster. If you want it deadlier, I think you should do two things: 1)make consequences last longer and 2) If you're Taken Out in physical combat without conceeding, you're dead or dying.<br/><br/>We started using -2 -4 -6 and minion stress two weeks ago, and we're not going back, ever. It has a better pacing for us as a group, making for more tight packed action in a single game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72053/#Comment_72053" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T12:27:58+00:00" title="May 27, 2007 12:27PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe that Evil Hat has an article on how they're tweaking FATE for The Dresden Files.

I like the way they get players to come up with the way that they got hurt, and the way they function as temporary aspects. I'm not so keen on the way they make it hard to take PCs out, and the relatively slight consequences of getting  shot up (which fits pulp, but not grittier genres).<br/><br/>I'm currently looking at a system that has multiple-box weapon damage by type (1-4, more or less), and that treats Consequences as something you get as a result of being Taken Out (wounded too badly to continue fighting). The idea is that for each box of overspill (effectively there's a second Health track for Wounded), the Consequence (wound) has one level of power. The resulting Aspect still does only -2, and costs 1 FP to compel, but buying out of it costs FP equal to it's level. Healing (or medical attention) gradually brings down the level of the Consequences. The time between level changes can be tweaked according to just how gritty you want to be. If you somehow manage to exhaust the second track, you're dead.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72127/#Comment_72127" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T04:18:42+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  4:18AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2007 4:51AM by Tonpa.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The system sound really promising, how long have you thought the base Stress Track to be? <br/><br/>For the Lovecraft, or Call of Cthulhu games in general, I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think the multiple-box weapons are the primary way. The reason Characters die are the middle range horrors, not usually the mobsters or cultists. Therefore I think the difference of Skill level could be the answer for more dangerous damage, more than the tool used. Still it would sound cool if the trusty Shotgun would deal Two Stress Boxes. Still I would leave pesky humans and minor minions with small damage values, with lucky shots being the most dangerous and the ganging up naturally.

Therefore I think the difference of Skill level could be the answer for more dangerous damage, more than the tool used. Still it would sound cool if the trusty Shotgun would deal Two Stress Boxes. Still I would leave pesky humans and minor minions with small damage values, with lucky shots being the most dangerous and the ganging up naturally.

I have never been huge fan of Shotgun and Dynamite approach when dealing with the Huge Horrors. The enormous skill part would mean something still relatively fightable, like Deep Ones, Ghouls, Mummies and the like; mostly humanoid monsters or something in similar Threat level. Mummy could for example have \xe2\u20ac\u0153Legendary\xe2\u20ac\x9d Might for olds school strangulations. \n<blockquote>On the other hand, if you're going one-on-one with a Deep One, it seems very pulpy to say that fists, a baseball bat, and a shotgun are all equally effective. </blockquote>\nIn this I think the baseball bat would be considered advantage, which would give opposition [-1] if not using narration to tell how he or she would overcome the reach and swing advantage of opposition, this as in SotC rules. As the narrative; \xe2\u20ac\u0153how I overcome this disadvantage of mine\xe2\u20ac\x9d, would be quite hard as the genre itself allows little or no personal martial art moves. For the Shotgun I would presume there is Aspect linked there, which would install the usual +2 for use and also give the options for maneuvers <i>Aim to belly</i> or the like. Additionally the Shotgun sounds good place for the two Stress Box damage weapon. \n<blockquote>As an aside, I'm also pretty doubtful about letting PCs defend against missile fire using their skills. That's a bit pulpy too. </blockquote>\nBut basic Call of Cthulhu has Dodge skill too, somewhat limited one, but still there is that. All in all I like that the Characters use some form of active defense, if no other reason than to have players roll the dices. This way they are acting in the defending phases too, and not feeling they are standing still. The Skill could be limited, and maybe hindered by environment, but the option to do something and narrate that is important in my mind.  \n<blockquote>Interesting, though<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2927" rel="nofollow">my approach to sanity</a>is rather different. </blockquote>\nWonderful stuff you have there!

While they are not active in the main damage dealing, they can still aid with environmental Maneuvers, the point being that direct attack is impossible for the duration, but indirect, with somewhat restrained physical and mental options is still available. Throwing a Spear directly to enemy is not allowed, throw the Spear to lantern to set carpet on fire is ok and therefore good maneuver.<br/><br/>EDIT: ...but as the first try for more hindering yet not lethal Consequences they <i>are</i> too harsh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72158/#Comment_72158" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T08:20:36+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  8:20AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can somebody quickly explain (or link to) the -2 -4 -6 thing?

The thing here was that the opponents (basically the minions doing the Blocks), were not able to harm the characters (or could have been, but I saw no point of harming them there and then), but they had the option to slow them and therefore bring in being the hostility of the scenery (closing <i>Horde of Germans</i>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72174/#Comment_72174" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T10:01:48+00:00" title="May 28, 2007 10:01AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2007 10:02AM by Dave Hallett.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tonpa, I'm glad you like the Sanity mechanic.

So you know you're going to be dropping shortly, and the Consequence-based Aspect is there to be tagged too.<br/><br/>I want combat in a Lovecraftian game to be fast, confusing and scary. But I don't want to take away the players' options - that's dull. I just want to offer them choices other than the conventional tactical ones, if you see what I mean. Your comments about the Block action are interesting. The action that did least to threaten the PCs directly, did most to raise the apparent lethality of the situation? Fun. I guess that's because they were wondering about the consequences if they didn't finish the combat fast enough (being pursued by a horde of Germans, right?). It certainly sounds suspenseful.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that your Consequences are necessarily too harsh (though they might be). My doubt about them is more whether they are idiomatic.

With some unification to either Stress system or earlier Fudge systems, would theoretically give more tools to other games too. The Corruption of the Dark Side being one example for uses. I myself devised a small system of <i>Corrupted Fate</i> for my Call of Cthulhu tinkering. Basically the Character had some <i>Corrupted</i> aspects from the background and novels (half of the starting aspects), [Haunted House as Childhood Home] for example or [Collection of Family Portraits] as another. From these they would got <i>Corrupted fate Points</i>, at the beginning of game as well as from compels targeting these Aspects. The amount of these CFP would slowly modify the perception of the Character and the Use of these would make the scenes where used someway twisted. \n<blockquote>My goal is to make that mechanic, physical combat and social combat (including letting monsters have a Fear-based attack) work fairly harmoniously. It's not simple! </blockquote>\nNo, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not. We had some success with swordfight we had couple sessions ago. The fight itself was put to two or alternatively three phases. The First phase was the Taunt/Intimidation phase, which did basic mental damage, which worked here to the same Track because the combat was not going to be to dead. The second phase was the main attack or the Physical Conflict. There was an additional phase between first and second in second and fourth volley, which was the maneuver phase. It worked quite well for duel. The duel itself was created because the duelists (by my GM ruling) created a block for the area (Good quality because the opponent had Good Melee) against shots to melee and intervention to the duel by other melee combatants. I say this because; the skill as block for intervention is nice way to present intimidating presence and that the phasing the combat to mental and physical phases does not slow it down too much, if it consists only few participants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72184/#Comment_72184" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T11:14:43+00:00" title="May 28, 2007 11:14AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>I should add that I don't regard CoC as being ideal in all respects as a Lovecraftian game, though it has a lot going for it.

If somebody is using something like the Shotgun in my game it becomes basically something the players will notice first hand, therefore there will almost certainly be [Ye Olde Shotgun] aspect linked to the place or to the [Old Barn hand with Gills] guy. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> If players use shotgun themselves, they usually either mark it as something important [Shotgun loaded with Silver Buckshot\xe2\u20ac\u2122s] or they will load it with suitable aspect; [Aimed to belly], [Kla-kla-klung!] or [Keep him busy Professor, I will put some \xe2\u20ac\u0153pepper\xe2\u20ac\x9d inside my boom stick\xe2\u20ac\xa6]. All in all this is all more about how I like to play the game and have interpreted the rules, not how it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s written. \n<blockquote>More generally, do you not find it useful to be able to distinguish between accuracy and damage? Or is that just too fussy for you? </blockquote>\nI would prefer to have them distinguished, yes, and I see that the greater damage value represents this nicely. The main point to me here seems to be the scale. The Shotgun is nice for two-box damage. Other classic is the Fire Axe. Other than that I would like to keep the things on the one box line. The \xe2\u20ac\u0153heavy weapons\xe2\u20ac\x9d, mostly Tommy guns and the like are usually prepared round or two, which nicely presents the option for Maneuvers, which in effect increases the certainty of damage. Basically when I do the minions with AA guns, I have them form two gun crews where the other does maneuvers to help the main attacker blast away, usually doing blocks or \xe2\u20ac\u0153declarations\xe2\u20ac\x9d about the scenery. This in Meta sense in fact. The value here is only for the players who want to do counter arguments.  \n<blockquote>What's your attitude to death spirals? I'm largely trying to avoid them, going with the "either you're OK or you're down and out" view of combat. Hence the post-Taken Out Consequences. I was also (btw) thinking of having a rule that once Taken Out (wounded) you can keep fighting for a while, but it costs you 1 FP per round to do anything at all. So you know you're going to be dropping shortly, and the Consequence-based Aspect is there to be tagged too. </blockquote>\nI myself love the player pushing forward with willpower, be that either consequence use or by indeed FP use. Desperation creates inspiration, inspiration in turn makes great scenes and great scenes makes players feel more deeply about their characters. Dead spiral seems therefore be my preference, if no other reason that give players more desperation over their characters closing doom. The post combat trauma was thought for this premise, for even more character battery. \n<blockquote>I want combat in a Lovecraftian game to be fast, confusing and scary. But I don't want to take away the players' options - that's dull. I just want to offer them choices other than the conventional tactical ones, if you see what I mean. Your comments about the Block action are interesting. The action that did least to threaten the PCs directly, did most to raise the apparent lethality of the situation? Fun. I guess that's because they were wondering about the consequences if they didn't finish the combat fast enough (being pursued by a horde of Germans, right?). It certainly sounds suspenseful. </blockquote>\nIt indeed was, and our game is basically led by maneuvering between potentially lethal areas, or trying to move with enough speed before the opposition musters the \xe2\u20ac\u0153Overwhelming Odds\xe2\u20ac\x9d. This seems to be quite ok for my players. They don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t expect themselves dying from the pullets from usual guards, but they are ok with the fact that the guard can pin them down with suppressive fire. After that the \xe2\u20ac\u0153German Horde\xe2\u20ac\x9d or \xe2\u20ac\u0153Gigantic Black Zeppelin\xe2\u20ac\x9d or similar impressive danger will put them down if they are not quick enough, no question asked. The same thing could work on more mundane adventure too, or so I think. There should be medium dangers still, those that I find lacking; while the Duel mentioned before was entertaining it did not hold any real danger. On Cthulhu, Cold City or Hollow Earth Expedition games I think this medium level danger is the most important part to be enforced and therefore aided to create the sense of danger. \n<blockquote>I'm not sure that your Consequences are necessarily too harsh (though they might be). My doubt about them is more whether they are idiomatic. Imposing blanket restrictions of that kind isn't very FATE, IMO. Still, it's a starting point.</blockquote>\nTrue. But for Horror based game I would think the some kind of restrictive Consequences are with the Genre. The \xe2\u20ac\u0153Cannot Initiate Action\xe2\u20ac\x9d part is wrong and too restrictive for player. The \xe2\u20ac\u0153Needs help to Move\xe2\u20ac\x9d sounds somewhat nice, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72197/#Comment_72197" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T13:13:18+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  1:13PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2007 1:15PM by Tonpa.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For some reason I have an addiction to symmetrical things for magic and therefore representation of Character traits. On this ground I thought three fold Stress Track for the Horror genre. Be that the Egyptian mysticism be the closes to the true universal order. <br/><br/>First part is the Body: <b>Health</b> in game term, <b>Ha</b> in Egyptian mythology and governing the Corporal things. <b>Endurance</b> being the associated skill. The Dark Vises associated here would be the <i>Gluttony</i>, <i>Sloth</i> and <i>Lust</i>. The basic needs are delivered from the corporeal body and the strain on the track could manifest as variation in subjects of food, activity and sexuality. The Strain in human in general, by confrontation of the unknown, would be suffered by disturbances of these three primal functions. Examples could be overeating or bulimia, inaction or spasms and disturbance of normal sexual excitement. <br/><br/>Second being the Mind: <b>Composure</b> in game term, <b>Ib</b> in Egyptian mythology and governing the emotions and thought. <b>Resolve</b> being the associated skill. The Dark Vises associated here would be the <i>Envy</i> and <i>Greed</i>. The basic needs are delivered by the emotional need of belonging and the mental need of control. The strain on the track manifests in subjects of persons association groups, logical patterns and control. The Strain in human in general, by confrontation of the unknown, would be suffered by disturbances of these three primal functions. Examples could be need of praise or the inability to trust, the inability to maintain internal security by logical thought patterns and therefore suffer paranoia and hallucinations and disturbance of persons association with the institution of ownership and property. <br/><br/>The Third would be the Soul: <b>Connection</b> in game terms, <b>Ba</b> in Egyptian mythology and governing the connection to the Afterlife and ultimately the Channel of <b>Ka</b>, or life force. <b>Empathy</b> being the associated skill. The Soul is that what makes person unique and that other unknowingly perceive and feel. The Dark Vises associated here would be the <i>Pride</i> and <i>Wrath</i>. The basic need are delivered by the connections need to move close to other Channels and associate with them, usually by modification of the flow of these other Channels. The Strain in human in general, by confrontation of the unknown, would be suffered by disturbances of this primal function. Examples could be need of fetishes of spiritual significance and closeness to overwhelming Channels, the disturbances in personal presence and ultimately the reputation of the person in more general sense. The Strain itself could manifest to surrounding more than to the person him or herself (as it would in case of Health) or to the persons emotional and intellectual relation to his surrounding (as it would be in case of Composure). The Damage to Channel could harm the surrounding itself as it could harm the surroundings connection to the person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72360/#Comment_72360" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T08:48:28+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  8:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the basis of three-sided damage it could be that persons health could be represented by these three values. The third stress track would therefore represent the person\xe2\u20ac\u2122s <i>spiritual health</i> and if needed the <i>mana</i> styled magical resource. The Damage done over the Stress track would hamper person, as would the other kind of damage types, with Taken Out situation being quite bad for persons Soul. The conflict in the Spiritual Connection could be done with Quick Resolution system, if needed to be dangerous. With the <a href="http://evilhat.wikidot.com/quick-conflicts" rel="nofollow">Quick-Conflict </a> style system being the developing tool. In my vision the contest could be done as a magical duel, where the reality would be the opposing factor usually, but could also be opposing <i>Connection</i>, be that other human, demon or spirit. <br/><br/>The Quick Conflict rules could also be used for other Attacks against the person\xe2\u20ac\u2122s health, usually something like diseases (where the Endurance is affecting the roll directly, not by Stress Boxes as in usual Physical Conflict).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72380/#Comment_72380" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T09:52:21+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  9:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Tonpa.<br/><br/>I'll come back to the combat details in a bit, but just to say, I like the Egyptian idea. It may be largely Mind, Body, Spirit rebadged, but it's atmospheric.<br/><br/>I wouldn't use it for something Lovecraftian (HPL and the conventional occult don't fit together well), but I could imagine it working well for something based on (e.g.) one of Sax Rohmer's magical thrillers.<br/><br/>I think you're getting a little off-topic with it though. Can we try and stay focussed on how we can use FATE mechanics and a basic Health track to produce grittier, less pulpy combat? That's my main interest here. If not, hey, it's your thread, but that's my 2c!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72394/#Comment_72394" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T10:56:39+00:00" title="May 29, 2007 10:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True, the point was to make some groundwork for the alternate damage types, being that the horror (or fear) attacks basically are equally effective in combat, or could be. Therefore the Deadly system could have three damage outputs and three \xe2\u20ac\u0153openings\xe2\u20ac\x9d to coarse characters. <br/><br/>But more base form (and leaving the Spiritual part away now) it would seem that three basic form of deadliness are manifesting themselves: <br/><br/><b>1:</b>  The Stress Track that is depleted faster; in this the minion type depletion seems to be quite optional. In Addition the option of Consequences, which is in development. Other Depletion methods, be that the reduction of Track length, marking to multiple boxes or boxes in blocks, need to tested to give the system the right feel. <br/><br/><b>2:</b> The alternate output of Mental depletion; this either giving alternate mean to reduce Track or to play with Aspects in addition of normal maneuvering, in essence go around the Consequence protecting Stress Track. One possibility could be that the Social or Mental Conflict could be an layer of Quick Conflict with the Physical one, where the \xe2\u20ac\u0153Consequence\xe2\u20ac\x9d delivered from losses are instant Aspects and the \xe2\u20ac\u0153Taken Out\xe2\u20ac\x9d part is additional \xe2\u20ac\u0153True\xe2\u20ac\x9d Consequence, therefore potential \xe2\u20ac\u0153True\xe2\u20ac\x9d Taken Out outcome. <br/><br/><b>3:</b> The Harmful Scenery or Block. It could be developed more specifically for Horror situation, like when the Monster itself is basically part of the Scenery itself. It would be said that the Vampire is part of his Castle, Aquatic Monster part of its lagoon and so on. One way for this could be to make the surrounding a collection of minions that use social actions (basically attacks) or physical actions (blocks) for the monster itself. In addition blocks could be used for the \xe2\u20ac\u0153putting players to corner\xe2\u20ac\x9d or the \xe2\u20ac\u0153horror going to overwhelm\xe2\u20ac\x9d style things. In Addition the scenery itself could be one kind of layer to the conflict, like mini chase scene, where the \xe2\u20ac\u0153revealed weakness of the monster\xe2\u20ac\x9d is the prize and something with equal value is the alternate penalty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72743/#Comment_72743" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T13:53:37+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  1:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK. Sorry for the delay in coming back.<br/><br/>Picking up from your last post, we have some possible tools in our armoury.<br/><br/>I'd like to focus on the options in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, which relate to physical combat. <br/><br/>I see the use of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> as an adjunct to physical combat, but a very useful one. In essence, if you want to run a game where the PCs seem to be constantly under threat, but seldom die, making them run before they can get too badly hurt is a good option. <br/><br/>And <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is kind of a side-issue, though very interesting in its own right. I'd love to see you develop an example of that more.<br/><br/>Getting back to physical combat, what do we have so far? I'll try to consolidate what we've talked about so far with some ideas of my own.<br/><br/>a. We can shorten the track.<br/>b. We can make hits check off more than one box (sometimes). At first this looks the same as (a) but actually it isn't. Not only does it offer more flexibility, it also has consequences for how important skill is in the game. And as you've said, making guns deadly has consequences.<br/>c. We can subdivide the track into rows, and make moving to each row have a particular meaning. My proposed system effectively does just that, the second row being the Wounded row. This can be combined with variable weapon damage so that rather than weapon checking off more boxes, they start counting on different rows.<br/>d. We can use Consequences in many ways. They can substitute for a hit. They can be used to reduce the degree of success, or the damage (or both, or user's choice which). They can be the result of being Taken Out, or of moving between rows in the track (see c). There may be other things we could do with them, such as getting a Consequence for reusing an Aspect in a combat, for example.<br/>e. We can alter the meaning of degree of success. For example, Fred Hicks has suggested that successes of degree zero could automatically translate to Manouevers rather than hits. Extending this concept, every success could be a Manoeuver, and some could simply do damage as well. That could be good for your death spiral effect.<br/>f. We could use Aspects differently. For example, you could rule that each Aspect can be used only once in a fight. If you then ruled that any hit (or any hit over a certain level, etc) results in being Taken Out unless the player spends 1 FP and invokes an Aspect, that could be interesting. <br/><br/>That's about it for ideas from me. I expect you can add to the list.<br/><br/>Some other things I would like to think about include: single blows that only knock someone out, how a system might help a group to find its own balance between gritty realism and PCs spending all their time convalescing, how to deal with something like a shoggoth in game terms, damage from falling, etc. and where the limits of this kind of approach lie. How about ramming Cthulhu with a ship?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72814/#Comment_72814" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T02:34:29+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  2:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And some things I forgot last night.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=10977.0" rel="nofollow">This Forge thread on Fear and Confusion in combat</a> is an interesting read, especially the approach that Tony LB describes, though I've not managed to come up with a formulation that makes it work in FATE to my satisfaction.<br/><br/>I could add to the list of tools:<br/><br/>g.
