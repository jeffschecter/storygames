                    So over in Joshua's thread about his rules for Storytelling games Tony and I were getting into an argument that, on reflection, isn't an arguement at all. So rather that continue that exchance, what I'd like to do is spin off of it into something more constructive. <br/><br/>The basic theory that Tony and I had been talking about is that long-term games have access to some powerful tools in the fact that they can build up development and history and reiterate narrative structures to make the game a cumulative process. I think everyone agrees that is a cool tool. (Tony?) <br/><br/>However, Tony and I were also in agreement that depending on that one set of tools alone is a faulty method. First, it won't help you either in one-shot games nor will it help you in the first few sessions of even a longer running game. This can lead to the "bored now for fun later" motif of gaming that we're all so familiar with. Second, if people think it is their only tool* it may keep them from trying other games that they could like equally well, or limit their ability to structure stories and games they may want to play. <br/><br/>So, with that in mind, what are some tools you guys have to kick start a game into high gear from the first moment? What are the techniques you use to make your one-shots grab and hold and emotionally engage (or mentally engage)? What methods do you employ to make sure the first session of your long term games is as fun as the later sessions despite not yet having the history tool to build off of? How can you make sure that every session of your game, including the first, hits its maximum game fun?<br/><br/>I've got a couple of pat answers of my own to this. The first is kickers: intense player generated story-starters that make sure that everyone starts the game with an explosion and an emotional stake. If each and every player is starting off with the scene that will define their characters for the rest of this arc of the game, then you start out pretty hardcore. <br/><br/>The second is joint-game/world/setting/situation creation with the group, and if you can manage it merging the creation with the first session of play. If you can get a good brainstorm on and get everyone engaged and have their energy up in creating the situation at hand (if not the larger world) and then move straight into play, it will help people push onto things while they're still fresh in mind and close to hand. I've had this especially reinforced after playing Mo's Game Chef game, because in its very codified brainstorm and then play format you never have a chance to let your energy down from the frantic pitch. <br/><br/>The third is, of course, use systems that support fast in play. This can be either because they're simple systems (Trollbabe rocks for this), or because they're systems that can have elements introduced slowly as they need to come in (Burning Wheel is recomended to be run in this mode). If you can get in and get playing fast, it helps with both of the above goals. Mastery of system can come with time. <br/><br/>I also like to, as part of prep, get pictures and/or themesongs for the characters (PC and NPC) of the game from the get go. Having visual and aural representation and cues that engage the aesthetic sense do a lot for me in jumping into what a character is about quickly. While long term play and development of a character is still important to my gaming sense, I find that a lot of the early awkwardness of trying to get a character is mitigated if I can have other ways of seeing the character. So give me pictures, give me music, give me multiple ways of seeing your character! <br/><br/>So that's me. What other things do you folks do? <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*This is seperate from folks who have tried other types of games, giving them fair shot and shake, and realized that they honestly do like one type and not the other. Those folks are fine and not missing anything, obviously.                </div>

<p>Abso-frickin'-lutely.  Cool.  We're on the same page!</p>
<p><code>So, with that in mind, what are some tools you guys have to kick start a game into high gear from the first moment?</code></p>
<p>And I reach down onto my desk, and pick up Nancy Kress's book, <em>Beginnings, Middles and Endings</em>.  Cool book, by the way.  I recommend it and I'm only half-way through.  She says:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>The point to remember about conflict is that it arises because something is not going as expected.  Your readers should suspect that as early as your first few paragraphs.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So the new (and experimental!) technique that I'm going to be trying is a variant on Kickers.  The questions I ask my players:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was your character trying to achieve before the story started?</li>
<li>Why do they, as a person, uniquely need to achieve this?</li>
<li>How did it go wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I want to skip that scene where it goes wrong.  That scene isn't the point.  The point is what the player will have his character do in dealing with the wreckage.</p>
<p>Here's the beginning of <em>Kare Kano</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Sometimes I wonder how people see me.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">

<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Yeah.  Yeah ... Someone special who stands out from the crowd.  So I guess that's who my classmates really think I am.  And I <strong>love</strong> to stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>But ...</p>

<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>... ever since I got to high school there's been ONE nagging problem I can't get rid of.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">

<p>That's three pages.  Three pages in a tiny little manga format comic book.  And I (at least) am <em>there</em>.  I know what the story is going to be about for the foreseeable future, and I want to see it unfold.  NOW!  Go!  Make trouble for each other and yourselves!  Get into the conflict.  No waiting.  GO!</p>

<p>Oh.  Cool!  Glad you like it.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, yeah, the more I'd want to apply the same criteria to any Kicker.</p>
<p>When you return from a hunting trip and find that your village has been taken by slavers, and bloody footprints leading away to the east ... well, yeah, you're driven.  And that's ... I suppose that's nice and all.</p>
<p>But when you want to put your warrior past behind you and marry the girl of your dreams, and so you go out into the woods on a voyage of spiritual purification with the great waterfall spirit finally cleansing your soul, and <strong>then</strong> you return to find your village has been taken by slavers?  That's not just driven.  That's <strong>thwarted</strong>.  And for my money that's where you find the guts of the thing.</p>
<p>Okay, who's next?  More techniques!  I crave more techniques!</p>

                            Kickers--or at the very least creating characters who are dynamic, have interesting goals and will do all sorts of things to achieve those goals--are definitely a tool I've used in the past, for games other than Sorcerer. (Well, I've played Sorcerer, too.) In fact, I'd say that dynamic, driven characters are essential for <i>any</i> Story Game. Even if the character appears to be Average Joe, waiting for something slightly interesting to maybe happen to him, the players have to know that Average Joe is really Dynamic Joe, and the player will push the character into interesting and complicated situations no more than 10 minutes into the session.<br/><br/>Joint setting and situation creation, even incorporating it into the rest of the game, is another technique that I've so far only used a bit, but intend to use from now on.<br/><br/>Tony, that Kicker variant looks way cool. I'll have to try that out sometime.                        </div>

<p>Oh!  I've got another one!  Give the players enough power to move the story in big, big ways straight out of the gate.</p>
<p>I'm not even talking about making their characters powerful.  Bazzilionth level magic-users still can't do <strong>squat</strong> if they have no idea what the levers are that can move the real stuff that will become the story.  Yeah, they can burn the moon to a cinder, but if the story (jointly created, of course, but still ...) will eventually concentrate around the warring of two factions, and neither of them are particularly driven toward or away from war by a burnt moon then the player hasn't <em>done</em> anything.</p>
<p>Getting the right information into the players hands quickly is key to empowering them.  This is something that can be a tremendously useful side-effect of jointly creating the situation (the information is imparted during that process) or you can do it other ways (as in Dogs injunctions to dump the problems right in the player's lap).</p>
<p>The failure to do this is, to my mind, the greatest problem of Nobilis.  I've seen game after game where the first few sessions had all of the players taking on the roles of curiously unimportant and uninterested Gods ... until several sessions down the line they finally get the lowdown on what is happening, and (if there's still any energy left) swing into action to change the world.</p>

<p>I <em>always</em> start in media res; I actually had a bit of trouble with Dogs because it didn't.</p>
<p>An average start point to a campaign for me...</p>
<p>I once ran a Black Ops game.  The players built their characters mechanically, aiming for "good builds", and I informed them that they were given their choice of missions.  I set up a map, put pins in it, and described the set-up.   The group had just broken into an island compound, and their sniper currently had a line to a head shot on their target.</p>
<p>Then I looked at the group and asked them "Okay, what did this guy do?  This is someone your team agreed to assassinate; this will be your first kill as a team.  What did he do to deserve it?"</p>
<p>That was an interesting few moments.</p>
<p>And then the sniper pulled the trigger, and the action started.</p>

Watching movies like that I find myself going, "come on, come on already" until the "thing" happens and the action starts finally getting under way.  Games, same deal. So skipping to the aftermath makes great sense. <br/><br/>It's also right along the lines of finding a routine &amp; breaking it formula from the book <i>Impro</i> (which I've only browsed but want to read).<br/><br/>Giving people the levers to manipulate the right things also means getting everyone's arrows pointing in the same direction, or at least compatible ones.<br/><br/> I'm in a game right now (PtA) where the collaborative nature of it has meant that while the GM was over there creating the big bad for us all to face, a player has been introducing her ideas of what it will be--leaving the GM to figure out whether to go with her original ideas or to use the players' or to weave the two together somehow.  Flags to make it clear &amp; apparent <b>what</b> is meaningful and important to act on, as well as getting the info up front are way useful to avoid this situation. <br/><br/>And also, meaningful opposition! Meaningful meaning: I can't avoid it and I care about it.  That also means having things you care about and having the ability to fight for them.  What exactly do you care about in Nobilis? I can see that being a problem. I had this exact problem, too, in a playtest recently, I'm smacking my forehead now.                        </div>

                            My top one is "start with the familiar".  <br/>
<br/>
So I try to base my games within an established genre with familiar tropes around.  (Vikings, Eighties James Bond movies, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, etc.)  Also, I always have a clear direction to move in.  Complications and complexity can and will be added in, but I find it's important to get moving first.  So, for example, in James Bond the PCs were immediately handed a mission and a message to intercept.                        </div>

                            Here's my two, one stolen and one personal:<br/><br/>(a) Roleplay incorporated into Character Creation.  Specifically, the Accomplishment in <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em>.  Setting up an entire game, creating characters, creating situation, <em>and then</em> starting in on roleplaying is a bigger task than most single sessions for most systems, so "start roleplaying" is not always applicable.  But short, character-focused scenes like these, and especially scenes that <em>bear implications for later play</em> grab big old handfuls of player investment and brings them right into the game.<br/><br/>(b) Situations built off of player flags.  The "bored now for fun later" comment really resonates with a lot of my roleplaying memories, of how we would be all jazzed about doing <em>this thing X over here</em> but we'd always start off the game doing some other thing in some other place so we could "build up to" doing the thing that we were all jazzed about, and that's totally fucking bogus.  The first session -- the first scene, if possible -- needs to immediately be about what the players care about.  Kickers are one way to go at this, but I like to think we're actually moving beyond kickers and into some more fluid and less ham-fisted flagging and situation-creation techniques.  The sweet and beautiful truth of the matter is, if you start off with the thing that you're all jazzed about, your players will use that as a launching pad to start creating new stuff to care about.  Treating it as a starting point rather than an ending point is good stuff all round.<br/><br/>(c) Also, in medias res is a fabulous means to acheive this, so I second Levi emphatically.                        </div>

                            JBR, that's not In Media Res.<br/>
<br/>
In Media Res would be that the girl had been cut down from the wellhouse, her lover was lying on the ground nearby with a Dog's boot on his neck and gun in his face, and the Steward facing down two other Dogs.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is In Media Res.                        </div>

                            Wonderful thread. <br/><br/>Here are a couple of my techniques:<br/><br/>1) Have the first scene be as powerful, evocative and immersive (if that's what I'm going for) as I can. Music is a must, preferably high-impact, and other atmosphere enhancers where appropriate. Strong descriptions that throw the players straight into the game, usually also containing whatever information they don't already have about what's happening, so they don't have to ask questions before going into play. It's not unusual for me to speak for 5-10 minutes straight at the beginning of a session, telling a story, describing, and generally pulling the players in. I've found that starting a session on a strong note is very helpful to keeping it on the high levels of involvment I prefer in my games.<br/><br/>2) For one-shots, and especially convention games, I try to have the pregenerated character sheets as involving as possible. <br/><br/>EDIT: I initially uploaded some character sheets as an example, but they seem to be giving me trouble. I'll try to fix it and re-post them.<br/><br/>For longer games I've found that letting the players look up their own character photos, pick theme songs and so on helps a lot with investment, but I guess that's for another thread.                        </div>
