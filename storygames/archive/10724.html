I haven't played or GMed it before.<br/><br/>To that end, I re-read the Sorc book, then hopped online and read Jesse's series of [Practice: Sorcerer] posts here, which led me to some Forge posts about it.<br/><br/>Whew! There's a wealth of information out there, but trying to process it all has made my head spin, and made me second-guess myself: "I can't run this game! So many people who've gamed for so much longer seem to have such a difficult time with it!"<br/><br/>I think I've been reading games and discussing them too much, and not playing them enough, because gaming successfully is starting to seem harder and harder. Does this feel true to anyone else? Is it simply the shakiness of an inexperienced hand? It seems to take a lot of work and more than a little luck, in terms of a group vision, to make a game really sing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238033/#Comment_238033" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T02:33:57+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  2:33AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's pretty easy to play RPGs, but yeah, there's a ton of work that can make it really good.

But the more you learn about the subject the more new sub areas that you really "should" learn more about pop up.<br/><br/>That you first saw the game as "normal" and then when you had learned more about it feel that the subject is huge is just a sign that you have learned stuff. :-)<br/><br/>I have been having similar doubts recently. The last session I was in almost crashed due to the players around the table coming from different "schools of gaming". But it is only because I have played so much and had so many discussions about gaming that I can see why we had the problems.  Ten or fifteen years ago I would just have said "The game sucked!" without being able to provide a good reason or explanation as for WHY it sucked. Now I am trying to find a way to fix the game, there must be something I can read on the subject...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238040/#Comment_238040" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T06:22:05+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  6:22AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There have been several discussions recently about how to teach games to people; you might find the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10496" rel="nofollow">Fluency Play</a> one interesting.  It's aimed more at teaching someone else a game rather than teaching yourself, but there's really no reason it couldn't work for that situation as well.  The short version:  rather than trying to learn everything at once, learn it piece by piece.  Most things get less intimidating when you break them down into smaller, more manageable chunks.<br/><br/>In fact, if you're really nervous and overwhelmed about a system, it might be helpful to hold off on jumping in to a full game; instead, let your friends know that you're also just learning the game for the first time, and play focused scenes targeted at exploring just one facet of the system at a time.  When you feel mostly comfortable with the basics, then you can start to put the pieces together and go ahead with running a full game.  (Think of it like the tutorial level of a videogame: you learn how to move, then you learn how to shoot, then you learn how to drive a car, then you learn how to pick a lock, then you start the actual game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238043/#Comment_238043" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T07:46:35+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  7:46AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say, I'm finding running my games incredibly difficult these days.  I walk away from the session in desolation, cutting up the night into portions of failure.  Why did this happen?  What went wrong there?  Could I have done that better?<br/><br/>At some stage during the week I am told how much fun someone had.  I think 'how? why? are you being honest?'  And then I remember that just because I find something difficult, or feel that I find something difficult, it doesn't mean I've done it badly.<br/><br/>I always look back to one of my old teachers in school.  I came out of a national Latin exam when I was a wee teenager.  I was very upset, as I'd done a lot of work on it and it hadn't gone well.  I was visibly shaken.  The corridors were empty, I remember, except my teacher was there.  He walked over and asked me how it went, so I told him.  I told him I'd done very badly, that I didn't think I'd pass the exam, and that it was all a waste of time.<br/><br/>He said to me, 'perhaps it wasn't so bad.  Perhaps you saw the difficult parts that other people missed.  I think you did fine.'<br/><br/>Later that year I got my results.  I had passed the exam.  In fact, I'd got a B.<br/><br/>So, like Wilhelm said really, it's okay if it seems hard.  It probably means you're a very good gamer.  Even if there are mistakes, that doesn't mean it won't be great                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238052/#Comment_238052" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T10:55:42+00:00" title="October 18, 2009 10:55AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2009 10:56AM by noclue.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans, Sorcerer does that to everyone.

I don't know, I usually get by the same way I do with all of my noncompetitive hobbies: by recognizing that the stakes are low and it's okay if I suck.  I start by reminding myself that I'm doing this just for my own amusement, and that no one will be killed, hurt, or even inconvenienced by any failure on my part, no one will lose a valuable endorsement deal, no one will be thrown out of their own home and have to live on the streets: the stakes aren't just low, they're nonexistent.  Then I remind myself that I'm playing with my friends, and that this is not the only fun we will have in any given week, and so this gaming session is not really all that important.  I allow myself to fail, if that's what's going to happen; and if it does, I laugh about how awful I was with my buddies, because that happens to all of us and there's no reason to get all worked up over it.  I'll just consider it a lesson to learn from and try to avoid failing that same way again next time.<br/><br/>That way, it doesn't matter if I'm so tremendously knowledgeable about a game that I will continually underestimate my performance and think that I'm worse at it than I really am...because no one cares if I'm worse or better than I think I am.  Not me, not my friends, not even people from the internet: exactly how good or awful I am at this amusing pastime is of no concern to anyone, anywhere, ever.  All that matters is that I and the people I'm playing with are having fun, and that we're good enough for Saturday night in our living room.<br/><br/>Seriously, the linked paper is mostly about how you <i>perceive</i> your own competence, and that only matters if there's a reason to measure your competence in the first place.  I would suggest that for most hobbies, you don't need to worry about measuring anything of the sort: there is only "good enough" and "not good enough yet, but improving."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238092/#Comment_238092" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T22:31:19+00:00" title="October 18, 2009 10:31PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Just for the record, when I have gotten something wrong in a game of Sorcerer, it hasn't been an apocolyptic event.

So yay.<br/><br/>I think Dylan has the right of it, with the added point that if you've had a lot of dud experiences it can really add to fear, even paralysis, in beginning a new game. At least for me, I got more and more caught up in the desperate hope that THIS game would be the magical perfect experience that would pull me from the mire of shitty gaming. And yeah, that was partially a reverent faith in game <i>texts</i>, but also expressed itself in a more mundane desire for a new group and campaign to work out. It was a lot of pressure to put on myself and my comrades!<br/><br/>I feel there's a balance to be intuitively struck between letting a game session be no big deal and yet striving for great things with it. It can be done, but there's no formula for it. It's a matter of <i>Flow</i>, i think--letting go of anxiety and expectations and being fully present and fired up in the moment.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>There have been several discussions recently about how to teach games to people; you might find the<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10496" rel="nofollow">Fluency Play</a>one interesting.

We spend a lot of time talking about how to hack or alter games to better suit what we already know how to do.  We don't spend enough time learning how to master a game as written.  That to me is odd since every other game-focused hobby has all kinds of material for leaning how to master an individual game.<br/><br/>I have no idea how to set up and administer a forum.  If I did, I'd likely start something liked "RPGs RAW" for (Role-Playing Games Rules As Written).  It would be very similar to the Actual Play forum at The Forge but with some tweaks.  First of all discussing games that you haven't played would be allowed so long as we were talking about a specific game or comparisons across specific games but not RPGs in the abstract.  Second there would be a formal process for flagging material in your AP  posts such that doing something which clearly contradicts or deviates from the text of a game would be clearly marked one way and techniques which the text seemed agnostic about would be flagged another way.  This way one could more clearly see what was going on in an AP via three categories.  Tier One: Rules As Written.  Tier 2: Not Explicitly In The Text but not Explicitly Contradictory Either.  Tier 3: Actual alterations to the rules as written.<br/><br/>This would, however, require a lot of heavy moderation and by people who were extremely fluent in the text of the games being discussed.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_238105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238105/#Comment_238105" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T04:20:02+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  4:20AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>I appreciate the advice, Tomas, I really do, but this kinda stuff is what seems to frustrate me in my attempts to understand games.</blockquote>Does it? Are you sure? Your initial post made me think the sheer amount of knowledge you have, have frustrated you. So I propose for you to make it simple.<br/><br/>By applying a simple base to your GM'ing, you may be able to work your knowledge into the game by increments, while still keeping your game full of tension and fun. But; only as long as you do not aim at "sophisticate" your game. Keep it simple!<br/><br/>Of course: you may be right. If so, there is no saving you. Sorry! Start playing soccer instead. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238200/#Comment_238200" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T13:40:32+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  1:40PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Does it?

So I propose for you to make it simple.</blockquote> You know, I thought the same thing as Tomas, and some of the follow-up comments that Dylan (FigureFour) introduced tended to reinforce that impression.<br/><br/>So let me ask: have you tried throwing out as much of what you know about gaming as possible? Cut the system to the bone, to take away the possibility of system mastery issues taking away from your success. Take on really restrictive constraints, to cut down on the "what didn't we do that could have been better than what we did?" factor, and also to minimize the scope in which everyone can get off of the same page. Spread out authority, so that everyone feels the same amount of pressure.<br/><br/>In short, play Puppetland. Stay perfect for one hour, and one hour only, under tight narrative and tonal constraints, with a system that you've mastered as soon as you've read it. Maybe it will make you feel better. I know it's worked for me - that game is grim dark chicken soup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238233/#Comment_238233" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T17:51:38+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  5:51PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Second there would be a formal process for flagging material in your AP  posts such that doing something which clearly contradicts or deviates from the text of a game would be clearly marked one way and techniques which the text seemed agnostic about would be flagged another way.</blockquote>\nWhy would anything ever be flagged in the second way when you had the first? Basically the whole forum would be flagged the first way, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
