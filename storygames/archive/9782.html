At that moment, I was connected to the spiritual overmind of humankind, and I never felt closer than I have to my brothers and sisters that share this planet. <br/><br/>It was during that time that the seeds of <b>The Challenge</b> sprouted in my soul. <br/><br/>I knew then that what my fellow humans wanted was not the same as what they <i>needed</i>. I am not a liar, but I had to deceive my fellow man in order to bring <b>The Challenge</b> into the Zeitgeist of human experience.  It was always my intent to bring about a competitive spirit that will smash the opponent's face, but the opponent was never supposed to be the fellow travelers at your table. The real opponent is the forces of darkness that stain the human soul.  Things like talking louder and faster in order to win arguments, macho posturing, and trash talking.

In that post, pretend to be the author of one of the games mentioned in the other thread.<br/>CLARIFICATION: Don't pretend to be the author of the game you criticized, because why would you criticize your own work?<br/>2.) I'll assign you to write a second edition of a random game.<br/>CLARIFICATION: Not of the game you criticized or the game you pretend to have authored.<br/>3.) Once you submit your entry, it'll be judged by the "first edition author" and the "first editon criticizer".<br/><br/>So, that should be like 100% clear, because I'm a brilliant and concise author whose work is very lucid.<br/>Post, pretend to have authored something, get a randomized assignment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217728/#Comment_217728" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T17:28:22+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  5:28PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify Joe further: the reason for identifying yourself as the author of one game or another is that you're choosing which game you're going to be judging if the designer of that one ever gets it done. A secondary reason is that now that 2nd edition designer has somebody they can ask questions from and rant at about their problems with the first edition. Who knows, you might even have some insight to offer - or at least it can be funny.<br/><br/>I know all of this because I am the 2nd edition designer of The Shadow of Yesterday, for realz.<br/><br/>Carry on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223500/#Comment_223500" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T04:07:31+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  4:07AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, looking at the calendar and the massive amount of work before me, I'm not going to get to a playable state with Crunch Dot.<br/><br/>It makes me sad.<br/><br/>Honestly, the interpretation I took for the 2nd edition of the game became a little disturbing for me - it's one of those games that paranoid folks would point to as evidence that gaming promotes drug use and anarchy. I also didn't like some of the terminology (pranks, specifically) that I had come up with, but wasn't able to find a good replacement word. Here's some of the text of the game.<br/><br/>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/><br/>Dear Reader:<br/><br/>Thanks for finding the new edition of Crunch Dot! <br/><br/>Those who know the story behind the original version might be surprised at some of the changes here. When I collaborated on the original version, those of us involved weren't... well, let's just say we weren't operating at 100%. Mentally. I mean, we were really fucked in the head. I had done so much meth that I couldn't see straight for weeks at a time. We weren't allowed much in the way of technology (or dangerous items), so the whole thing got banged out on a crappy manual typewriter by someone with Tourette's. Once I got clean, I decided to ask for the rights to the game and redevelop it, keeping some of the core ideas and throwing out what didn't work. You won't see the scattered, twelve-chefs-stirring-the-pot design of the last version. You will definitely see a brutal game about breaking the system both mentally and physically. You'll also see some of our therapist's Zen Buddhist influence, and a unique mandala-like character creation system. Finally, you'll see why the game is named the way it is. I hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/>-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/><br/>Your character is a drug addict. He or she is hooked (psychologically, if not physically) on a particular type of illegal substance. Moreover, this substance has some severe drawbacks that are going to make your character's life hell from time to time. However, unlike in the real world, this drug has opened your character's eyes to a world beyond the one we know. He or she is a boddhisahttva - someone who has achieved enlightenment and returned to our world to help enlighten others.<br/><br/>The eventual goal of all characters in Crunch Dot is to bring enlightenment to as many people as possible. This doesn't mean that your character will go out and give drugs to as many people as possible - most people aren't ready for it, and the drugs have some pretty heavy side effects. What you're trying to do is dole out kensho, little doses of insight that lead to eventual satori (enlightenment). Many of your character's actions will appear to most people as clever pranks. A certain percentage of the population will realize the meaning behind the pranks and find their minds dwelling on them, some eventually experiencing kensho. Particularly effective pranks can leave whole crowds staring slack-jawed as each of them experiences a tiny slice of nirvana.<br/><br/>This lofty goal is not easily reached. When it comes to pulling pranks, many things stand in your character's way, from locked doors to armed guards. Materials for these pranks must be obtained as well, legally or not. The greatest challenge your character faces, however, is his or her own addiction. Each drug unlocks a specific part of the character's mind or body, but comes with substantial negative side effects and the dangers of overdose. You'll spend about as much time dealing with your character's addiction as you will attempting to bring enlightenment to the masses.<br/><br/>In short, here's what's going on in the game:<br/>    Your Character's Goal: Break "the system" and bring enlightenment<br/>    Your Character's Methods: Drug use, self-alteration, mental programming, screwing with people's minds<br/>    Your Character's Obstacles: The difficulty of pulling of enlightenment pranks, the problems that come with drug use<br/>    What Your Character Does: Carry out a prank. Cope with the drug dealer getting busted. Run from the cops. Pull a B&amp;E for money. Sneak into a secure location. Deal with a friend or teammate who overdosed. Distance or try to convert old family members. Have a conflict with another sect of characters.<br/><br/>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/><br/>The specific drugs told you your character type: acid, cocaine, heroin, ketamine, or meth. Drugs had an in-game effect, but also had side-effects listed for during use, long-term use, overdose (or just a really bad instance of use), and withdrawal. You had to go through withdrawal before you could retire a character.<br/><br/>I was going to try using my old <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1234&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">graphical character sheets</a> idea as well. Oh well. Still on the back burner.<br/><br/>The Illuminatus trilogy was a big inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223569/#Comment_223569" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T16:00:30+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  4:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I have failed to complete The Challenge, 2nd Ed.<br/>You're not hte only sucky competitor, Colin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223578/#Comment_223578" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T17:50:58+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  5:50PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also have failed.
