The guy's never played a roleplaying game, but when he asked what I was talking about, I pitched it as "Ghostbusters meets The Office" and he wants to play now.<br/><br/>I've run the game twice for my old gaming group, but I never did figure out how to GM it properly.  We muddled through, but it wasn't too great.<br/><br/>My problem is that, since we don't know exactly what the ghost/monster/aliens/animal trapped in a shoebox is until the players decide, I don't know how to apply adversity to the PCs.  When they fail a roll, I'm all over that, but between such moments I don't know what to throw out there.  And we end up with a whole lot of piddling about, as the players don't have anything to react to.<br/><br/>Games where the GM has a prepped untenable situation and antagonists but no pre-imagined plot, I can handle that.  But when I don't even know what the antagonist <i>is</i>, I'm left flailing.<br/><br/>Lots of people have fun with this game, so it's clear that I'm missing something.

You can make things up, too. They have to work from what you create, just as you have to work with what they create. The only difference is that you don't have to wait until a die roll to make shit up.<br/><br/>So let's say there are strange sounds from the basement. The Research phase should gather some clues, and in that phase, you shouldn't have many problems. Do you have issues already there, or is it just the Field Work? Maybe they find that a bunch of people died in the basement. Well, throw some ghosts and zombies at them, then! Make up what's in the shoebox. The players will add to whatever you throw out there and make more stuff up. Creating the fiction is not their right, it's their priviledge. And they have to win a die roll to get that priviledge. Inbetween rolls, that power rests with you.<br/><br/>At least that's how I play the game, and it gives me lotsa fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171543/#Comment_171543" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T13:38:25+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  1:38PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hit them with Stress, and don't feel guilty about it.

That can inform the stuff that you throw into the story. Usually, I'll roll the basic problem and pick something simple like "ghost" or "werewolf" or "possessed toaster". Of course, once the players get to narrate stuff it will turn out to be something completely different, but that usually seems to flow on pretty naturally, as you revise the working theory (e.g. "werewolf") to fit facts discovered ("it came from outer space").

The less Cool they have, the more vulnerable they are to Stress checks. Characters who are vulnerable to Stressed checks are more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n(<i>One way of looking at Cool as it lets the players feel they have a degree of control over their own competence, so they don't freak out when you keep hitting them with malicious and escalating Stress Checks.</i>)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOTHER GM TIPS:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Base adventures around people the characters know, occupations they used to have, and their Talent. Bringing the InSpectres into contact with NPCs they already have connections with is gold.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Keep bringing the characters' personal lives into it. Force them to juggle the mission with parenting, romantic relationships, and anything else they've come up with during character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Play hardball. Don't be afraid to kill off NPCs they care about or otherwise damage the players' calm. If they really want to, they can make a roll to save the person or situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Keep encouraging the use of the confessional chair.  Set up a special chair close to the game table (perhaps at its head) for people to use. Emphasise to the players that they can give other people's characters traits.

What does it do for the game?</blockquote>\nI've only played twice, so I'm doing some serious extrapolating here, but here's what I think it does.  Stress lowers the PCs' stats, requiring them to spend the dice from the Cards.  Also, to get rid of it, you have to take payed leave.  Basically, it causes the PCs to eat up the franchise's resources over the long-term, putting their shared concern (the solvency of the franchise) at risk.
