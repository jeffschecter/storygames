                    Okay, so one of the many game designs overburdening my brain right now is Agora, in which you play a group of people and their leader, defined primarily by your Ideals and your Resources.  Ideals are rated in dice and change through the course of play -- specifically, you use Ideals to fuel actions, and fallout from those actions can rewrite your Ideals.  You get like "three words fallout" and have to change three words of your Ideals.  "Change" being defined as "add one, remove one, or change one."  Ideals are all answers (or half answers, or pointers to answers) to the question, "How shall we live?"<br/><br/>Character generation has you pick a Faction and a Culture, both of which come with starter Ideals, and make up a Background, where you write an Ideal for yourself whole cloth.  I've got four factions and eight cultures below.  I'm taking a page from Burning Wheel and not providing any more context than a name and its Ideal for each one -- players are more than capable of contextualizing everything in actual play.<br/><br/><em>My question to you:</em> are these "grabby" enough, do they get you thinking about playing a character/group that follows these principles?  Do the factions mix-and-match with the cultures in interesting ways?  Additionally, is the wording (which is important in play) open to manipulation, or should it be changed?  <em>I'm very interested in suggested rewrites of these Ideals.</em><br/><br/><b>Factions</b><br/>The War's combatants included too many nations, alliances, cartels, and religions to count.  Here are four -- they may have been the most prominent or simply the most immediate players in the PCs' experience of the War.<br/><br/>The Diamond Alliance --  "Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither."<br/><br/>The Great Circle -- "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."<br/><br/>The Hierarchy -- "Lessers serve their betters to become greater themselves."<br/><br/>The Uprising -- "The oppressed must rise up and claim what we were denied."<br/><br/><br/><b>Cultures</b><br/>By the time of the War, the peoples of the galaxy had shifted and intermingled so thoroughly that no culture was unknown in any faction.  Here are eight of the galactic cultures.  Again, these may be the eight most populous cultures in the galaxy, or the ones that the PCs know and interact with the most.<br/><br/>Ardent Orthodoxy <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of Seraphim (Seraphs)</span> --  "The Divine shapes and guides the Faithful."<br/><br/>Augustan -- "My family was born to rule those without the Blood."<br/><br/>Bucoli --  "Tradition gives us pragmatic solutions to modern problems."<br/><br/>Greens -- "The natural world teaches us life lessons."<br/><br/>The Legion (Legionnaires) -- "Life is a battlefield of victors and losers."<br/><br/>Oppidan -- "Diversity combines many strengths together."<br/><br/>Plutonic --  "Greed creates and commerce animates all worthwhile things."<br/><br/>The Savan -- "Observation and investigation yield the curious the universe."<br/><br/>Looking forward to feedback!                </div>

                            Oh, yeah!  But just take those factions and cultures and matrix them out.<br/>
<br/>
How many of them are incompatible with each other?<br/>
<br/>
When do factions and cultures become indistinguishable?<br/>
<br/>
Could one imagine a Great Circle Plutonic?<br/>
<br/>
How about an Uprising Augustan?<br/>
<br/>
How about a Diamond Alliance Legionnaire?<br/>
<br/>
If you do that matrix, you may find that there are some simplifications that you can make.                        </div>

                            I don't think any factions are really totally incompatible with any cultures, although I will agree that some are odd matches.  The thing is, the odd matches are <em>really fucking cool</em>:<br/><br/>Great Circle Plutonic: use market forces to care for the poor &amp; disenfranchised.<br/>Uprising Augustan: a prince once deposed and now coming back to power.<br/>Diamond Legionnaire: mercenaries, pirates, and theives (now play a whole faction of them).                        </div>

                            Josh, my initial comment is that these look solid, and you want to encourage challenging juxtapositions.  <br/><br/>I'd like to see the names abstracted more, so you could give them your own spin - I don't like other people doing the imagining for me.  The four factions could be red, green, blue, and black, for example.  There are probably solid social/political science terms for the other schools of thought as well.  YMMV.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>In that case "Seraphs" is the only one I have bones with. A little too Judeo-Christian for my tastes. <br/><br/>Other than that, I am suddenly excited about the game.

                            I have to tell you, the faction/culture breakdown confuses me.  They both seem to be a varigated bunch of ideologies, political philosophies, and manifestos.  <br/>
<br/>
I've played some of the newer White Wolf games which all use a 5x5 matrix for character generation, and usually they have one axis which is what your character is *born into* and one axis that represents *who they associate with*. The execution may be lackluster, but it was easier for me to get my head around.  <br/>
<br/>
About Factions:<br/>
Now, besides that issue, my main concern is that it's hard to tell how these statements would actually come into play.  For the Factions, at least, I'd really like to have statements which suggest that particular Faction's distinctive approach to the war, which seems to be the dominant setting element.  Right now, the Factions don't sound like actual Factions in an actual fictional war -- I have no idea what any of their war aims are, which IMHO is leaving a little too much creative space open to the players. <br/>
<br/>
In particular, the Great Circle statement is a direct quote from Marx, I think -- it doesn't have much to say about how to conduct a war, and it also is going to bring up very different images to diferent people -- do you organize strikes of the starship pilot's union?  Create a revolutionary vanguard that strives to overthrow the existing order? <br/>
<br/>
Cultures: I think these work a bit better, and there's lot of examples in science fiction of cultures which are disproportionately focused on a single activity (Classic example is the Dorsai), so it's easy for me to picture a culture which is singlemindedly focused on scholarship, or war, or religion.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd like a bit more specificity and color in the cultural descriptions.  Perhaps you could use the Heroquest technique of using colorful, suggestive descriptors that aren't really defined?  You already do that a little bit with the names of the Cultures.                        </div>

                            Hey, Danny!<br/><br/>Firstly, the War isn't so much the focus as the backdrop of the game -- while you can certainly go in with guns blazing, you can also forge alliances with your erstwhile enemies.  The game is far more focused on the question "how shall we live?"  On the other hand, a principle like "The will of the people creates peace and prosperity" is an ideal that Bush is using to forward two invasions and counting -- it's all about how the ideal interacts with real situations.<br/><br/>There isn't really a definitional distinction between faction and culture -- it's not like one is a group of one thing and the other is a group of another.  If you squint, the factions are more grandiose 'how the world works' sorts of ideals and the cultures are more on the ground 'how we interact with the world' ideals.  That distinction isn't very prominent, though, I agree.  It's also more than possible for the players to create their own factions and cultures if they like.<br/><br/>The real brunt of the faction/culture divide is to allow players to have one in common and not the other -- so two players could be from the same faction, and therefore start off working together, but still have that cultural difference to make them distinct.  Or the other way around, players with different factions but the same culture can find similarities that let them overcome their differences.<br/><br/>As for how they come up in play -- I have a (long-ass) <a href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/2006-03-28/agora-what-play-looks-like/" rel="nofollow">example of play</a> posted to my blog.  Maybe that will clear things up a bit?                        </div>

                            Like, you have these factions and cultures... and elves and rotating scimitars and stuff.  And you go an adventures with your faction against other factions, etc. GURPS, d20, TSOY, whatever, but this is looking pretty interesting anyway.                        </div>

                            Ah!  Yes, certainly.  From the burgeoning manuscript:<br/><br/><b>Alternate Settings</b><br/><br/>It isn't too hard to dream up alternate settings with similar problems and interactions.  There are three necessary ingredients:<br/>1) lots of people following a handful of ideogogues<br/>2) engaged in conflict where the friction is not quite open war<br/>3) big stakes of how the whole world works afterwards<br/><br/>Warcraft: how shall we live?  Develop the world of Warcraft, playing nations of the Alliance, peoples of the Horde, clients of the Steamwheedle Cartel, and so on.<br/><br/>Factions:<br/>The Alliance -- We stand stronger together than apart.<br/>The Horde -- Lessers obey their greaters to become greater themselves.<br/>Steamwheedle Cartel -- Profit flourishes in every conflict.<br/><br/>Cultures:<br/>Quel'Thalas -- Beauty is the goal of all things; we live to release it.<br/>Ironforge -- Quality is the measure by which a thing performs its proper function.<br/>Frostwolf Clan -- Life is struggle and victory red in tooth and claw.<br/>Stormwind -- Luck smiles on those who take chances.                        </div>

                            My only real comment, other than 'yeah, baby!' is that you should simply have big-ass lists of these Ideals, and let the players mix and match as they see fit.  Certainly include examples, but I'd let the freeform flow with this - you'll get much better results.<br/><br/>Also: The Ideals of a Faction are, by definition, cultural - meaning socially transmitted ideas.  I think what you're aiming for here is a global &amp; local ideals - here's the faction that spread to the stars, here's the local variant on the global ideal.<br/><br/>I'd frame it that way: Universal &amp; Factional/Provincial Ideals.<br/><br/>Going to the Thesaurus:<br/><br/>Province (meaning class):  branch, brand, breed, cast, caste, character, classification, collection, color, degree, denomination, department, description, designation, distinction, division, domain, estate, family, feather, frame, genre, genus, grade, grain, grouping, hierarchy, humor, ilk, kidney, league, make, mold, name, nature, order, origin, property, province, quality, range, rank, rate, school, sect, section, selection, set, source, species, sphere, standing, status, stripe, style, suit, temperament, value, variety.<br/><br/>Faction: band, bloc, bunch, cabal, camp, caucus, cell, circle, clan, clique, club, coalition, combination, combine, combo, concern, conclave, confederacy, conspiracy, contingent, coterie, crew, crowd, design, division, entente, gang, guild, insiders, intrigue, junta, knot, lobby, machine, minority, mob, network, offshoot, outfit, partnership, party, pressure group, ring, schism, sect, section, sector, set, side, splinter group, team, unit, wing<br/><br/>Universal: accepted, all, all-embracing, all-inclusive, allover, astronomical, broad, catholic, celestial, common, comprehensive, cosmic, cosmopolitan, customary, diffuse, earthly, ecumenical, empyrean, entire, extensive, general, generic, global, mondaine, multinational, omnipresent, planetary, prevalent, regular, stellar, sweeping, terrestrial, total, ubiquitous, undisputed, unlimited, unrestricted, usual, whole, widespread, worldly.                        </div>

                            Seriously, the terms Faction and Culture are both pretty arbitrary.  I've already changed "Followers" to "Lieutenants" so I'm sure other things will shift around, too.  I suspect new terms will present themselves (or I'll just get used to these).<br/><br/>I do still want the two-teir chinese menu set up, though.  The part that I don't have listed here is that your choice of faction and culture determines your starting dice in lieutenants and resources.  So there's that.<br/><br/>I also do want to give <em>some</em> structure to the backdrop, in that there was a War with sides the players can pick so that characters can be dropped in prepped for conflicts.  Note that I don't need to say which side each faction was on, or if it was some four-way war or anything; the players can do that themselves.  They just need an identity to start with, enough to say, "I am X, and you are Y, which means that we are different and therefore have a relationship of some kind."                        </div>

                            I have to admit, I totally missed the shape symbolism.  I'm not much of a visual thinker.  I'll try to give you some more focused feedback on the specific wording, which is what you originally asked for.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also thinking of the old computer game *Alpha Centauri*, which was made into a not-very-inspiring GURPS sourcebook.  The factions, found here at <br/>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Alpha_Centauri#Factions<br/>
were really cool, and really added a lot to the game.  I usually played the University faction and spent a lot of time crushing the Lord's Believers, for what it's worth.                        </div>

                            I've got a little logo with the four shapes lined up, so I doubt once that's presented alongside, nobody's going to miss them.<br/>
<br/>
And there's a reason the AC factions seem so similar. ;)                        </div>
