But for them to get involved in the hobby they'll have to play again or it will just be a one-time thing. What are the different ways they can get their second game? And what do we need to have in place to help them move into the hobby?<br/><br/>I know a lot of advice can be valid across the whole roleplaying hobby, but I also know that story games and indie rpgs in general have a different 'hook', can provide a different experience, have some advantages (shorter playing time and no necessity for a GM), but also challenges, so I'm particularly interested in any thoughts on what a "enjoyed a story game at a con one time" person needs in place to become a regular story gamer.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399696/#Comment_399696" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T13:15:18+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  1:15PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>They need for scheduling to be convenient</b>. Three factors that influence this: food, transportation, and childcare. Inviting someone over to your house for dinner and a story game, and arranging to have another player pick them up and carpool? This reduces one vector of commitment uncertainty.<br/><br/><b>They need to feel comfortable and welcome</b>. Factors that influence this: choice over game, feeling socially included, gender balance. You could ask the person to join you and another gamer friend for coffee, and then say, "Hey, next Friday we were thinking about playing a game - either a zany caper game called Fiasco or a post-apocalyptic drama game called Apocalypse World. Does either of those interest you?"<br/><br/><b>Other opaque factors in their life need to line up</b>. If someone says, "that sounds cool, but not this week," be gracious about that answer. Don't try to badger them into playing a game. Read their body language &amp; other signals to find out whether it'd be appropriate to inquire further about when <i>would</i> work for them. Often I like to respond by broadening the specific invite to an open invite and leaving it at that: "Okay, cool. If you're interested in playing in the future, we tend to meet up on Friday evenings. You have me on Facebook, right? Yeah, you've got an open invite if ever you should want it." If I do something like that, I might then CC them into a group email about an upcoming game every 3-6 months, but no more than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399698/#Comment_399698" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T13:20:02+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  1:20PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>They need to feel like they're good enough</b>.

Or maybe, "It's rare that someone is able to bounce around between different character accents so quickly. You've got a gift."

With roleplaying it's "you mean like D&amp;D?" This hits the crux of what scares most people off of roleplaying: they associate it with fantasy dorkdom, obsessing over character sheets, and games that last hours and hours with regular weekly meetups.<br/><br/>Obviously a number of indie games escape most of these factors allowing for easy one-shot games where everyone can jump right in and have fun with minimal to no boring prep. Game systems such as Dread, Fiasco, and Lacuna are great for this; other systems can work too if you have preset characters already built but I would avoid any system with a character sheet filled with a huge list of skills/powers. <br/><br/>While you could invite people over to play ______ game you could also just invite people over for food/drinks and games in general whether it's cards or board games or an rpg/storygame. Then \u2014 <i>once they are trapped at your place</i> \u2014 you can convince them to try out ______ story game: "It's a simple and fun one-shot game and don't worry it's not D&amp;D, you don't need to know anything about roleplaying or the rules." Ideally start out with a game that involves:<br/>- Next to no player prep or character development.<br/>- a worldscape/theme that requires minimal explanation, is easy to grok, and relevant to their interests (Best if you can just say "It's basically like this movie")<br/>- a game/story that can be resolved in a few hours of play (avoid campaigns; if the game is running long push the plot along).<br/>- a game/story that can get underway quickly with minimal to no exposition.<br/>- a sense of humor and a good story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399742/#Comment_399742" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T18:46:31+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  6:46PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My go-to first and second games are, right now, Dungeon World and Fiasco. It works in either order, but they're both great for one-shots, and very beginner-friendly (DW works wonderfully even for players with no background in D&amp;D, don't let anyone tell you different). I like the combination because on the one hand you have a game very steeped in the lore and traditions of tabletop gaming, and on the other hand you have something radically different in terms of mechanics and content, but still very accessible via the tropes of popular movies. It's a great way to show people the breadth of possibilities without alienating them with interminable rulebooks, complicated stats, or genres/content that they aren't comfortable with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399768/#Comment_399768" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T01:09:24+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  1:09AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all interesting stuff for if I'm looking to bring a friend into the hobby, but what about if they're a stranger?<br/><br/>I go to a city and run a story game at a multi-hobby con for several random punters.

You can manage that by just playing games that takes less than two hours to play, and by giving them a really good time. If they enjoy it, they will show up for seconds.<br/><br/>I believe it's really important to stay in contact as well, and not handing over the responsibility to the newcomers to find gaming groups or the games themselves. It's basic marketing technique. Let the product come to them. Take their emails, or add them on Facebook, to follow up with more information, like direct links to where to buy the games or suggestions of more upcoming gaming events. And like [b]McDaldno[/b] says here above: spread the words to other gamers to seek them up and invite them into their own gaming sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
