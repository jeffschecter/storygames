As a writer/tech-writer/editor by trade, I've managed to craft dozens of vivid, logical (or at least structurally sound), and fun settings too!  The only problem is that the setting we both like the best seems to be bordering on "fantasy heartbreak" territory if we correctly understand what that means.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's my questions:<br/>\n1.) Should I try a radically different setting and wrinkle the system to fit the new world?<br/>\n2.) All testing points toward fun...should I let my reservations destroy that?<br/>\n3.) Should I even care if mainstream success is not an issue, but maybe some small-time recognition would be nice (but not overwhelmingly necessary)?<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch love for all the replies that I've gotten on my various project ideas here!<br/>\n~Klaus                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gru" title="Gru"><img alt="Gru" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gru">Gru</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310142/#Comment_310142" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T11:43:49+00:00" title="January 29, 2011 11:43AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um.

Typically a fantasy heartbreaker will be solid, passionate work within its own framework, but that framework is relatively problematic for people outside the immediate circle of the designer: because the designer is largely ignorant of the greater dialogue and gaming culture outside his own circles, the design ends up relatively stunted and disinteresting for anybody who doesn't share the same exact gaming micro-culture the designer has. Ron calls these games "heartbreakers" because it's easy to read them with sympathy if you realize where the designer is coming from: the typical fantasy heartbreaker does contain genuinely compelling ideas, and it's heartbreaking to see them embedded in a substandard framework caused by lack of experience and functional design methodology.<br/><br/>This phenomenon was common when the design culture was overall more isolated and best practices were more undeveloped - basically, before the Internet allowed us all to communicate easily, and contrast and compare games, marketing and design methodology with each other. A new designer will still create what I would myself consider Fantasy Heartbreakers today, though, and we see them now and then: eager game design that has a very narrow appeal because the game's main sales point against D&amp;D is that it fixes some idiosyncratic little bugs that seem so very important in the local scene but aren't really that important for the rest of the world. Although the Internet is keen to use this term any which way, Ron usually limits himself to discussing a specific trend of fantasy heartbreakers through the '90s, opting to not draw parallels from the historical phenomenon to specific current game-designs.<br/><br/>As for your conundrum, Klaus, I would definitely recommend sticking with your game and not caring about whether it might seem derivative to somebody else. What you might consider is developing your design method to affirm and reaffirm to yourself that your project is worthwhile and fulfilling of your goals, but that's something you need to answer yourself; random Internet strangers are not competent to decide whether you should continue with your work or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310152/#Comment_310152" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T14:48:10+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  2:48PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Klaus, make the game that is most fun for you, that works the best for you, and that you like the most.<br/><br/>That way, you will put more effort into it and feel more satisfied during the process and more proud of the final product.<br/><br/>If you go and present it to people when you think it's ready and they aren't impressed with the heart-breaker setting (I assume it's more-or-less "generic fantasy"?), well, then you've got these other setting ideas sitting around on the back-burner, don't you? Save your second- and third-favourite settings for when people want them, and if you find an audience who wants your bizarre settings instead of your favourite setting, their enthusiasm will make up for it and energize you to work on it.<br/><br/>To answer your questions directly:<br/><br/>1. You should try adapting your system to a radically different setting as an exercise to see what your system can do. You might like the outcome a lot! But don't change the setting in an effort to please an audience or promote the game. Do that kind of thing AFTER you finish satisfying your own gaming table's needs.<br/><br/>2. Fun is number one! Don't start worrying about what other people think until you're ready to show it to people.<br/><br/>3. Don't bother trying to impress specific people or nebulous groups of people that you don't know personally and don't actually game with. As long as you write a game that you have fun playing, somebody else will want to play it too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310153/#Comment_310153" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T15:01:01+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  3:01PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2011 3:01PM by Teataine.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To answer your questions directly, imo, ymmv, etc.<br/>1. You can try it as an exercise that will put things in a new perspective, but if I were you I wouldn't focus on it. Not if what you've got is good.<br/><br/>2. Never. Instead, identify what's fun about it and strengthen that. Why is it fun, <b>which mechanical parts of the game are making it fun</b>? Why? What are <b>you guys doing at the table</b> that's fun? Distil all of that into the book: rules, procedures, advice.<br/><br/>3. A weird and distinct setting won't bring you any more recognition than a generic one if the game itself isn't solid. You can still  add your unique setting as a supplement later or write a new game specifically for that.

Doing it that way may also avoid the niche problem identified as a characteristic of the heartbreaker.  A hack with clearly delineated deviations from base rules may also make playtesting easier since you can tap the larger community of enthusiasts for whichever system you're basing it off.  I'm working on setting hacks that use the Storyteller system as their base, this takes away a bunch of the legwork I have to worry about because the base of the system is already there and there are a bunch of people who know the system and could give feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310168/#Comment_310168" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T19:07:57+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  7:07PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll echo what others have said:<br/><br/>It's the year 2011 and we're talking about small-press tabletop role-playing games . . .

There is no guarantee that anyone beyond you and your friends will be interested but at least you aren't risking large sums of money to find out. And if you're mainly designing for yourself (rather than to solve the problems of a larger audience), then does it matter? <br/><br/>In my opinion, the new "heartbreaker" is when people design to please themselves and are disappointed that other people aren't interested. If your designing for yourself, only your opinion matters. If your designing for others, then the process of designing is going to be completely different (and often harder). Designing for yourself is frequently less work, more fun, and less risky because you only have to impress 1 person. Which is partially why I think so many people design for themselves (although I personally find it easier to design for others so there are exceptions). But if you design for yourself, then don't worry about what other people think. But many people do. And thus the new heartbreaker (in my opinion).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310211/#Comment_310211" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-30T17:59:40+00:00" title="January 30, 2011  5:59PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to sum up Eero's explanation in a single sentenc:<br/><br/>"Just like D&amp;D, only better!"<br/><br/>Way back when RPGs were new, it was not unusual for someone to reproduce the experience of D&amp;D, but with different mechanics. It may have some priceless ideas buried inside something that provides the same type of experience. Then they try to publish it and it simply doesnt' fly with the gaming public and someone just wasted a lot of time and money. That's the heartbreak.<br/><br/>Game design is both and Art and a Business. It really depends on what your intent is. If this project is something that you consider for just you and your friends. Great, leave it that way and learn what you can from the experience. On the other hand, if you do want to make a go of publishing it, here is what I would suggest:<br/><br/>Read Games... a wide number of different games. Please excuse me if you do have a huge RPG library already.<br/><br/>FUN is a big factor. If you and your friends are having fun with it, that is a good indicator. Tastes in games vary widely, so get in mind as to what audience you are making this game for.<br/><br/>Don't build a game around a mechanic. (This was a big mistake I made.) Take a theme from the fictional world you want to play in and get the mechanics you need to reproduce that. The mistake a lot of the heartbreakers made is that they reproduced the theme of D&amp;D's "Kill the monsters and take the loot" but used different mechanics. Mechanics can be repurposed. work from the outside-in, not inside-out.<br/><br/>Playtest the hell out of it. Don't just play with with your friends, or have new people play with you running the game. Get the game to a point where you think it will hold up on its own and then get it out of your hands entirely. Have several playtest groups run it from beginning to finish and provide feedback. A good group may pick up on mistakes that you've made, but have been compensating for in your own play. Sometimes, they may even make suggestions that will improve the game. There are a number of indie games that I have played that were unflinished but published, forcing the players to fill in the holes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KynnBartlett" title="KynnBartlett"><img alt="KynnBartlett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KynnBartlett">KynnBartlett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311032/#Comment_311032" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T01:22:28+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  1:22AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to deliberately make a fantasy heartbreaker game.
