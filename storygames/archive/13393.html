A lot of traditional roleplayers frown upon those players who make no thorough and rigorous distinction between "what the character knows" and "what the player knows". The comfusion between Metagaming and Positioning is explained briefly in the Provisional Glossary.<br/>In another forum (Italian) two guys are arguing about Metagaming. However, one is talking about Metagaming in the Glossary's meaning, while the other means Positioning. And I'm striving to explain the misunderstanding, giving a thorough definition of the two and through examples, just to make sure. <br/>A real mess is coming out in that thread, and this because no AP is provided by any of the participants.

Knights get +2 to hit. I get +2 to hit!</b><br/><br/>"Knights get +2 to hit" is a <i>currency</i> rule: it establishes a relationship between one component of a character ("I'm a knight," <i>positioning</i>) and another ("I get +2 to hit," <i>effectiveness</i>).<br/><br/>Here's how knowing something can work, and can cause problems:<br/><br/><b>My knight knows that the beast of Dunford Ridge is vulnerable to silver, so he loads his musket with a silver ball. He inflicts double damage!</b><br/><br/>"My knight knows that the beast of Dunford Ridge is vulnerable to silver, so he loads his musket with a silver ball" is, yes, positioning. There's a currency rule in play - "if you attack something with a material it's vulnerable to, you do double damage" - so this small detail of positioning becomes increased effectiveness, the double damage. So far so good.<br/><br/>But what about this?<br/><br/><b>As a player, I know that the beast of Dunford Ridge is vulnerable to silver, but my knight character doesn't. Nevertheless, he loads his musket with a silver ball. He inflicts double damage!</b><br/><br/>Here I've short-circuited the currency rule, which is supposed to turn character knowledge into increased effectiveness. All my friends shout at me that I'm cheating!<br/><br/>The real culprit isn't "metagaming," but the combination of two factors. Factor 1 is the currency rule, "if you attack something with a material it's vulnerable to, you do double damage." Factor 2 is the circumstance where I, as a player, happen to already know that the beast of Dunford Ridge is vulnerable to silver, before my character knows it. Together, they create a conflict of interest for me as a player: I want to do double damage, and I want to have my character act with internal integrity, but now I have to choose between the two.<br/><br/>You can attack the problem two ways, then: you can take on the problem of player's vs character's knowledge, or you can take on the problem of the currency rule. There's no single ideal solution; there are a million solutions (one per game design) and you choose the one that best suits your precise needs. The fights start when someone takes one solution, like "make sure that the player doesn't know anything the character doesn't know," and insists that it IS the single ideal solution, or else that it's NEVER a suitable solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301895/#Comment_301895" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T10:16:05+00:00" title="November 23, 2010 10:16AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An interesting edge case (to me, anyway) is a statement seen on character sheets around the world:  "Player Name: John Doe."<br/><br/>Is the owner of a character part of Positioning?

Depending on how the GM interprets that relationship, that could mean they have access to all sorts of cool stuff like maps, writs, money, horses, armor, and other rich dudes.<br/><br/>It may seem a little odd to think of "friends with noble" as a character component, but that's Positioning to a tee.<br/><br/>(Nerdy aside: That example still affects currencies, they're just<i> in-fiction </i>currencies like "influence in the gameworld", rather than capital-C <i>game</i> Currencies, which effect mechanical adjustments.

Any element of your character that indicates how your character is <b>positioned</b> relative to any element of the situation (including but not limited to other characters, institutions, important objects, and locales) is Positioning.<br/><br/>So, you know that whole battle mat thing in D&amp;D? That's a Positioning thing. It shows us how the combatants are Positioned relative to each other in physical terms, which the currency then transforms into Resource and Effectiveness of various flavors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302035/#Comment_302035" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T22:45:12+00:00" title="November 23, 2010 10:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The term "metagame" means waaaaaaay more things than just this, to me \u2026.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302040/#Comment_302040" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T23:05:23+00:00" title="November 23, 2010 11:05PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2010 11:07PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendez, yeah, that was just a reference to a usage that was already outdated in 2004.

In situations where there are no in-game currencies, how a character is positioned through 'color' text can have a large effect on the game. Whole old-school play styles (avoiding invoking any part of the rules the require rolls because the character is more effective when the player is describing things to the DM than when invoking mechanics)  were built around it. Maybe it is just my experiences, but there still seems to be a metagame aspect to a lot of character positioning, but maybe people have moved towards thinking of influencing the fiction with your color as the game rather than as metagame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
