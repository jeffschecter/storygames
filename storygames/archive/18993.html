Basically it's a big, traditional role-playing game set in a world where EVERYTHING from the X-files, Buffy, Torchwood, Sanctuary, The Invaders, Doomwatch, V etc etc is ALL true.<br/><br/>Players control ordinary people sucked into extraordinary events whose best efforts to protect the Earth ultimately fail. The traumas of the alien invasion cause them to change (alien virus, alien power armour, a gift of Excalibur from Faerie-folk, becoming a Vampyre et al). These new superheroes have to co-ordinate the efforts of both Mankind and Earth's supernatural denizens to throw off the yoke of alien oppression.<br/><br/>Like most SHRPGs, <b>Squadron UK </b>starts with the players creating their Heroes. However, the system can easily handle non-superpowered adventures. By allowing the players to get to know their characters as ordinary people first - before their Superhero origins - <b>Squadron: X</b> makes those alter egos much more meaningful - emulating the plotlines in recent movies and TV series.<br/><br/><i>And what DOES happen when a Vampyre bites and alien?</i><br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/121097/Squadron-X?term=squadron+x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpgnow.com/product/121097/Squadron-X?term=squadron+x</a><br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/121097/Squadron-X?term=squadron+x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/121097/Squadron-X?term=squadron+x</a><br/><br/>(Oh, and don't forget to check out Squadron UK whilst you're there......)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
