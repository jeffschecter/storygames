It doesn't tell enough about the setting.  My first thought was: horror?  It looked like ghouls and a teenage werewolf.  I much prefer the 1st edition cover, which shouts "space opera".  I'd recommend keeping the one above for an inside splash page.<br><br>Then there's the text; it talks about "a complete setting including nine races and their sub-races, their worlds, their governments and all the interstellar organizations," but not about why we would want to play them.  In other words, what is it about <i>Nebuleon</i> 2nd ed. that makes it different from <i>Traveller, Thousand Suns, Dawning Star, Star Wars, Fading Suns</i>, etc.?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf" title="Svante Landgraf"><img alt="Svante Landgraf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf">Svante Landgraf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133543/#Comment_133543" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T01:33:40+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  1:33AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't know how detailed you want the critique to be, but the first three paragraphs are justified where the fourth is not.

Currently, the text up there is from the first edition cover and it will need to be updated. So, yeah, it needs work.<br><br>As for the art, I am commissioning an artist and have run some concepts past them. Here they are:<br>Concept 1: The Traveler cover<br><a href="http://traveller.wikia.com/wiki/Image:Traveller_Book.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://traveller.wikia.com/wiki/Image:Traveller_Book.jpg</a><br/>The above is a cover I have always liked for traveler. I would jazz it up a bit with putting a Gren or Balek in it, and have them firing beam weapons.<br/><br/>Concept 2: The Party<br/>Standing on a ridge, with a burning colony behind them, a party stands ready to defend those behind them. Guns ready or guns blazing.<br/><br/>Concept 3: The Dremin<br/>A Dremin (3m tall lizard man) with an exotic looking axe is bearing down on a human in tattered armor blasting away with his assault rifle. We might want to have some sort of out of frame action going on here.<br/><br/>Concept 4: The Fight<br/>Capture the feeling of the Marines in Aliens.

And the conventional wisdom on designing covers to appeal to players is to show characters that can inspire a "I want to play that dude" reaction. First edition Unknown Armies has a gorgeous painting of a dead guy on a kitchen table. The cover appeals to prospective GMs, not prospective players. No one looks at it and says "I want to play that dude." First edition Over the Edge has a high concept illustration of two well-dressed characters walking unawares toward a broken pavement drop-off into oblivion. No one looks at it and says "I want to play that dude." Covers like the current cover of Primetime Adventures inspire a "many GMs" group, but you're aiming at a traditional group. So, although I love the art style of your latest iteration, the problem is that there's no figure that can provoke the "I want to play that dude" reaction. The human figure is too clearly in distress. My recommendation is to rework the dynamics of the figures. The Talislanta 4 cover has the right figure dynamics. But do it in full color.<br/><br/>Short answer: The human needs to be edging out a win in the conflict.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145028/#Comment_145028" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T07:02:25+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  7:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or alternately, HARP does it right as well, by capturing the moment before the conflict.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145080/#Comment_145080" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T10:19:43+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 10:19AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2008 10:20AM by HinterWelt.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>May I be a dissenting voice here?<br/><br/>William, to be honest, I don't know what the game's about.

So, yeah, it sucks and will be changed, hopefully, for something better.<br/><br/>As to the art, well, my play testers like it. My boss likes it. It is far more descriptive of the character action involved in the game. It is much more descriptive than the Nebuleon V1 cover (not pictured here) that led people to believe it was a space ship game. <br/><br/>As tot he first cover pictured, well, yeah, I like that one too. It is some art I have for the cover of a supplement and it fits the supplement better (Free Traders League). That said, I liked both. I think this cover says "Alien World". The woman with the blaster says "Sci-Fi". The Dremin (lizard guy) says "You can play aliens". The action says "It can get dicey".<br/><br/>That said, I see your points.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145091/#Comment_145091" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T10:46:22+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 10:46AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>If you<a href="http://feartheboot.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=179876" rel="nofollow">believe Ryan Dancey</a>, it's the players, rather than the GM, that choose which games get played. And the conventional wisdom on designing covers to appeal to players is to show characters that can inspire a "I want to play that dude" reaction. First edition Unknown Armies has a gorgeous painting of a dead guy on a kitchen table. The cover appeals to prospective GMs, not prospective players. No one looks at it and says "I want to play that dude." First edition Over the Edge has a high concept illustration of two well-dressed characters walking unawares toward a broken pavement drop-off into oblivion. No one looks at it and says "I want to play that dude." Covers like the current cover of Primetime Adventures inspire a "many GMs" group, but you're aiming at a traditional group. So, although I love the art style of your latest iteration, the problem is that there's no figure that can provoke the "I want to play that dude" reaction. The human figure is too clearly in distress. My recommendation is to rework the dynamics of the figures. The Talislanta 4 cover has the right figure dynamics. But do it in full color.<br/><br/>Short answer: The human needs to be edging out a win in the conflict.<br/><br/>Paul</blockquote>\nIf the game was about playing humans, I would agree. As it stands, the Dremin (the lizard guy) is coming down pretty hard on the Thri T'kree (big insect dude). Most of the folks I have run the cover past have seen that. Some haven't though. Kind of late in the process to be reworking though.<br/><br/>Thanks for the comments guys. If nothing else, it helps make the next cover better.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145121/#Comment_145121" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T12:13:15+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 12:13PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me jacking with Jeremy's fine work...<br/>\n<img alt="Nebuleon-Cover-SecondIII.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://neb.hinterwelt.com/images/Nebuleon-Cover-SecondIII.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145241/#Comment_145241" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T01:55:42+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  1:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice idea, but I think you need something on the front cover to say "sci-fi".

Even White Wolf and Wizards of the Coast (whose brand will help sell the game) don't use up that much space. Personally, I'd replace it with a tagline on the front cover to explain the game ("An Otherworldly Game" or "Adventures with Other Races and Worlds" or preferably something less lame than those two) and centre "Nebuleon" on the spine. There's so much HinterWelt Enterprises that it threatens to overwhelm the name of the game.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146078/#Comment_146078" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T22:04:15+00:00" title="May 26, 2008 10:04PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to Mark Quire.
