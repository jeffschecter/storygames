The adventure is about a series of events that, if left unchecked, could lead to the Biblical Armageddon. Since the events could happen in any order rather than along a linear "countdown," I used checklists rather than countdown clocks. (Like, in the front relating to whether an Archangel might Fall, they get a "minus" in a checkbox if he discovers the PCs are spying on him for the other Archangels, but they get a "plus" in a checkbox if they publicly testify on his behalf to the other Archangels.) Perhaps allowing players to explicitly address a front with both "positive moves" and "negative moves" works against the sense of creeping doom that comes with a countdown clock, but it felt appropriate for a setting where hope means a lot.<br/><br/>The checkboxes themselves were a pain to deal with as an "interface," though. It would've made it easier to see how things were going along the way if I'd used some kind of visual aid like a countdown clock. If I do this in the future, I'm going to use something like the round table in Shadows Over Camelot: You put a black sword on when you fail a quest, and a white sword on when you succeed at one, and you lose if the table fills with more black swords with white swords, but you may do the quests themselves in any order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419185/#Comment_419185" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T10:32:54+00:00" title="July 29, 2013 10:32AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome, <a href="/forums/profile/JasonT">@JasonT</a> !                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419195/#Comment_419195" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T12:57:05+00:00" title="July 29, 2013 12:57PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently working (where working=thinking about how I need to write something down) on making some Fronts for my Trail of Cthulhu adaptation of <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i>.<br/><br/>Masks lends itself pretty readily to this (maybe more than other Cthulhu scenarios) because of the various conspiracies in each location--each one can be considered (to borrow from DW) an Adventure Front, and all tie into the Campaign Front: the Big N wants to bring cosmic weirdness down to good ol' Planet Earth.<br/><br/>I've found in my preliminary work that it really focuses me on what's going on, what each Threat wants to achieve, and how they work together (or, because I like my wheels to be within wheels, against each other.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419212/#Comment_419212" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T22:03:01+00:00" title="July 29, 2013 10:03PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Deliverator! And I just got a chance to read Johnstone's posts linked above \u2013 great examples in there that can definitely be applied to a variety of other settings. <br/><br/>I've been thinking about this thread a bit, and I remembered one other thing that I found useful in thinking about fronts in other kinds of games: going in with an idea about what triggers their advancement. In Apocalypse World, "advance a countdown clock" is always an option on a hard move, presumably informed by what's going on in the fiction. In a game where you don't make hard moves, though, it's not always necessarily obvious when is the right time to advance a countdown. <br/><br/>In the In Nomine game I mentioned above, I had it kind of easy: The fronts had conscious adversaries behind them operating on their own schedule. All I had to do was arbitrarily decide some deadlines for when things needed to be addressed by the PCs before they just happened. (Probably the most depressing was when the PCs spent a night spinning their wheels and wasting their time on a red herring, only to hear one of the Seven Trumpets of the Apocalypse blaring out in the morning while they were waiting in an airport to get to where they actually needed to go. But what's an Apocalypse without a few moments of futility and despair, right?) I imagine it might be a little trickier to determine the pacing of fronts that aren't so purposefully directed, though, like the spread of a disease. Maybe you just advance things when you feel like things are getting boring, but it could be nice to have in mind a more deliberate mechanical trigger (more so than a fictional trigger, as there's no telling what the players will do).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419214/#Comment_419214" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T23:00:53+00:00" title="July 29, 2013 11:00PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2013 11:01PM by Johnstone.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason I like ordered countdowns -- ie having the grim portents proceed in a specific order -- is so that pacing isn't an issue. You just look at the top entries of all of them and pick the one you like best, when it's your turn to say something, frame a scene, whatever. Or when you don't know what to do next, look down, pick one, keep going. You don't have to worry about linking them to hard moves and whatnot.<br/><br/>The point being that you do most of your "thinking about the future" ahead of time, so when you're playing, you can concentrate on thinking about what is happening right now.

But then you gotta remember: advancing a Front when things get boring *is* good technique. Otherwise, things may seem too hurried for the PCs to meaningfully have any agency. Like, in my Wizard Game, the PCs really only spent serious time dealing with one of the three Fronts, and I let the others fade into the background. But that's fine! They had enough to do, and were quite engaged in dealing with the main Front, so it's not like I was betraying anything by letting the other ones lie dormant.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
