I, as any good MC should, can't help but feel a bit of glee as these trad gamers break out of their shells and experiment a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that isn't why I'm posting. My question is this. If PC #1 attacks PC#2 on normal terrain without any special circumstance. Is PC #1 Going Aggro (or seizing by force is the other is aware and armed against the attack) and PC #2 interfering? Or is PC #2 Acting Under Fire and PC #1 interfering? Or if they've both agreed to attack one another am I simple exchanging harm for harm as one of my moves?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the book it gives an example a pc pulling a gun on another pc and the pc being attacked acts under fire to avoid while the attacker interferes. But I wonder if this is the only way it should be done or not.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376000/#Comment_376000" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T16:08:02+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  4:08PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Either of those works (Go Aggro + Interfere / Intefere + Act Under Fire). It really depends on what's up for grabs in the fiction. Is it about whether the shooting PC can make the other cave and do what they want? Go Aggro. Is is about whether the other PC gets shot? Act Under Fire. Or you can figure it out by just who declares their action first.<br/><br/>PC#1: "I'm gonna go looking for Rabbit."<br/>PC#2 (Rabbit): "I'm getting the hell out of there, before she catches me!" (Act Under Fire + Interfere, probably).<br/><br/>PC#1: "I'm gonna punch Rabbit in the face until he acknowledges my authority!"<br/>PC#2: "Crap, I resist and don't let her punch me." (Go Aggro + Interfere, probably).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376008/#Comment_376008" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T16:25:57+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  4:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2012 4:29PM by Krippler.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Be very meticulous about the fiction. Who is where and does what exactly? What does attack without any special circumstance mean? Like, is the other PC aware of the threat? Is she aware where and when the attack is coming from? Does she have her guns ready?<br/><br/>For my next campaign I'll try make Sieze by Force only about like storming bunkers and shit, Go Aggro about flanking or ambushing (and just normal violent threats) and when someone is just slugging it out it's Trade harm for harm. When Acting under fire to see if you can dodge the first question is: is it possible to dodge in this situation and keep AW seeming real? I'll probably try to make AUF less about dodging a surprise attack and more about doing something else <i>while</i> surprise attacked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376117/#Comment_376117" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T06:07:47+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  6:07AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The trickiest part of AW PvP is what happens when both characters want to hurt each other.  Seize by Force generally favors the aggressor, and sometimes there isn't a clear instigator.  You can have both characters roll their Seize, but if both hit you have to work through the matrix of options.  "If you tell me you're doing more harm I'm going to choose receiving less harm, but if you don't chose that I'll choose takes hold of it blah blah blah."<br/><br/>I say, kill off the NPCs they like best.  Avoids the PvP, and really gets them where they live.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376121/#Comment_376121" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T06:26:57+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  6:26AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you do mutual opposed seizes by force, don't let them discuss their choices.
