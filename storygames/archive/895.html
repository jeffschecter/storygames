<p>This thread arose out of Fred/iago's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=890&amp;page=1#Item_9" rel="nofollow">reiteration</a> of a common concern:  namely, that the process of producing, marketing and selling your game is, for many, far harder and less intuitive than the act of creating the game itself.</p>
<p>So, I have ... knowledge.  Wisdom?  Maybe.  Knowledge?  Definitely.  And I'm totally keen to help people <em>not</em> be mystified by this process.</p>
<p><strong>Producing</strong></p>
<p>You print books.  All other things being equal, you want to print them as cheaply as possible.  The basic factors that will conspire against that:  Quality printing (quality costs) and small print runs.</p>
<p>Personal Experience:  <em>Capes</em> is 160 pages, 6x9, perfect bound.  It is mid-upper range in terms of book quality, and prints in batches of 100.  It costs $5 per book.</p>
<p>If you want a better book (hardcover color holographic, for instance) you pay more than that.  But, mainly, if you want to print smaller print runs (particularly if you want to print on demand, one at a time) you pay more for that privilege.  If you're willing to tie up some of your capital in inventory you can save money by taking advantage of economies of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
<p>People are not going to spontaneously decide one day "I wonder if there's a game that does the following exact things," and search and search until they find your web-site.  They should.  It would be the responsible thing to do.  But they won't.</p>
<p>They will look into your game because they are infected with enthusiasm, which almost always happens in one of a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>They hear it talked about or referenced, not once but many times.  </li>
<li>They read actual play  </li>
<li>They get a chance to play it before they buy  </li>
<li>They know you, either personally or through reputation, and transfer their personal feelings about you onto your products.</li>
</ul>
<p>The act of marketing is, quite simply, making as many of those things happen as possible.  There are (to my way of thinking) two venues that provide obvious benefit for very low cost:  Internet (where you broadcast your enthusiasm and coolness very ineffectually, but to a vast number of people) and conventions (where you broadcast your enthusiasm very effectively, but to a much smaller number of people).</p>
<p>Whatever your individual tactics turn out to be, I recommend that you keep working at them <em>incessantly</em>.  People who keep hammering away at the very basics <em>sell more games</em>.  People who make an occasional effort, then lapse into passivity waiting for customers to come to them <em>sell less games</em>.</p>
<p>Marketing is where many of your expenses above-and-beyond the books will come in.  It costs money to travel to conventions, it costs money to buy in on joint print advertisements, it costs money to maintain a web-site, to print flyers, to create a poster, to laminate demo-cards, etc., etc,. etc.  These costs are (if things go well) a way of plowing your profits back into growing your business, so it's not wasted money, but you should figure for it in your costs.</p>
<p><strong>Selling</strong></p>
<p>The physical act of getting your book or PDF into somebody's hands, and accepting their money in return, can be a bit daunting too.  It's <em>really</em> easy at (say) Double Exposure conventions:  they let us set up a table, charging us nothing, we hand books to people and put their money in our pocket.</p>
<p>But most of the time it's more complicated:  If a convention doesn't give you free space then you have to pay for it (and think real hard about whether you want to spend, say, two hundred dollars to sell books at a convention that may only sell ten books).</p>
<p>And then, most sales happen online these days.  You're not physically handing your book to somebody, or accepting their cash and stuffing it in your pocket.  <em>Someone</em> is accepting their money online (usually by way of PayPal) and that same someone is shipping them the book (or setting them up to download the PDF).</p>
<p>If that someone is you then you have some costs:  storing your inventory (often a cost only of closet space), maintaining a web-site, and like that.  But, mainly, the cost is going to be of your time.  You'll be going to the post office a fair amount, shipping books all over the place.</p>
<p>If you partner with someone else (IPR, Key20, etc.) then they will handle the fulfillment of those orders for you.  And, of course, they'll charge you for it.</p>
<p>The ultimate extent of this is <em>traditional distribution</em>.  Distributors advance retail stores credit, and push product onto bookshelves (with various levels of aggressiveness) and all that stuff.  And, of course, they charge an arm and a leg.  I don't think mainstream distribution has much to offer a starting indie publisher, although I can talk about my distaste for the model if you haven't already soaked it up from the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Say you've got a complete game that costs you $5 to produce.  You are prepared to market it, and sell it.  What do you sell it for?</p>
<p>Tell me you didn't just say $15.  I said $15, way back when.  I mean ... the point was to get the game into people's hands, right?</p>
<p>Y'know what?  NO.  The point is to increase your own ability to maintain and support the product in a variety of ways <em>all of which cost money</em>.  Marketing it costs money.  Selling it costs money.  That money, plus the price of your book, is your overhead.  Your price <em>must</em> reflect your overhead.</p>
<p>Personal Experience:  I expect, within the next year, to release two products, each for $7.  But, they'll each cost less than $2 per book to produce, and I don't expect to market them worth a damn.  They'll get marketing from the coat-tails of Capes.  So I don't have as much overhead.  If the books don't take off, of course, I know exactly where to lay the blame ... my own stupidity.</p>
<p>So what happens if your price <em>doesn't</em> reflect your overhead?  Well, no matter what your sales are like, you will discover a few months into the process that you simply do not have enough money to do all the things for your book that you'd like to do.  You don't have the cash in the business account to buy a banner stand, or to print a banner to put on it.  You don't have the cash to go to GenCon this year.  You don't have this money because past marketing has not paid off in cash ... it's paid off in sales, but because each of those sales is not producing enough profit, it hasn't paid off in absolute dollar terms.</p>
<p>When you do not have enough money to continue to grow your book, you will either (a) spend more money than you've earned, which is a slippery slope into really <em>really</em> bad business practice or (b) scale back your marketing efforts, which is a vicious cycle of ever-dwindling sales and profits.  Those are <em>not good options</em>.  They are not good for you, they are not good for your game, and they are not good for the many, many people who will never get to hear about your game because you don't have the wherewithal to get the message to them.</p>
<p>'kay.  I've rambled in a long-winded and wandering fashion.  If anyone has questions or comments, I rather expect that's where the useful material of this thread will emerge.</p>

                            Great article, Tony. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
btw, how did you get your new products to print for less than $2 per book? And why charge $7 and not say $9.99?<br/>

<p>The products are going to be a mere 64 pages, saddle-stitched, no color cover.  They're cheapy-cheap.  They'll probably go for $5 at conventions (to simplify cash-handling) but they're really targetted to be whimsy buys on IPR, and help convince people to buy items in the $18-$24.99 range.</p>

<i>Here's where I ramble.  Note, I'm not trying to directly address, explicitly agree with, or explicitly disagree with, anything that was said at the start of this topic.  This is more my own brain dump of my fairly recent experiences and observations.</i><br/><br/>For the time being, I'm on direct sales only, and I'm only making about $3/book (the POD production costs with Lulu are in the neighborhood of $6 and change), selling it at $9.95<br/><br/>Right now, I know that's way underpriced (at least, that's what I hear).  If I wanted to do this book with distribution, but still print on demand in order to avoid maintaining my own inventory and such, and I only wanted to make about $0, or maybe as much as a couple bucks, per book, I'd need to price it nearly $10 higher.<br/><br/>At that higher price point, I don't think I'd have sold 47 copies of the book (PDF and softcover POD) in the first 4 days, if I did that.  But as of this writing, I have.<br/><br/>My production costs on this were about $50-75 (art based on stock photography and manipulated with my own photoshop skills is fairly cheap, and that plus a few proof copies is all the cost I incurred).  As things stand, with the sales made to date, my royalties are around $160.  I've more than covered the cost to produce, and I didn't have to maintain any taxable inventory to do so.  (Y'all do realize that you have to pay taxes on any books you don't sell, every year they're in inventory, right?)<br/><br/>In a total vacuum, I don't really want to do distribution -- I'd be making the same profit per copy, charging much more per copy, as I'm making now, with direct sales only.  Retailers want to be able to buy games from distributors at about 40% of cover price.  That means whatever my production costs are, I need to increase by 150% in order to get a <b>break even</b> pricepoint.  I realize economies of scale help to kick that down a bit, but what of it?  I can't do anything but look at that sort of math and, in outrage, determine that I should go it alone.<br/><br/>But the question is one of volume and ongoing opportunities.  Given that I was able to sell approximately 50 copies in four days, using just the channels I have available to me through blogs, mailing lists, and the GPA press exploder, at a price point of $9.95 on softcover prints and $4.95 on the PDFs, making about $3 (or $4, in the PDF case) per sale...  how many more units can you <b>assure</b> me I would sell at a cover price of more like $17, but with the units getting sold via distribution chains to retailers for $6.80 a pop?  Enough to make up for the fact that my margins would be similar or slimmer than I'm getting now?<br/><br/>Even setting aside the distributor question, which is pretty much a "duh" for me here, and looking more at the question of, if I'd sold this for $12.95 (approximately doubling my margins), would I have cut into my sales by more than half?  That's a harder question to answer.  But I will say that I deliberately and consciously chose the $9.95 price point due to a perception of its position as very strongly tweaking the impulse buy.  I've talked this through with a number of people.  $12.95 was the "yeah, I should buy that" price, while $9.95 was a "sweet christ, how can I NOT"?<br/><br/>There's also something of a reality that these books are getting shipped individually to people, and Lulu's charging usually between $3-5 to ship one single friggin book to them.  (That price stays mostly static with a number of additional books tacked on, so I would encourage people to buy as groups, but I'm pretty sure that's not how it's playing.)  So I try to think about that, too, with my pricepoint.  Now, it's more like someone's spending $12.95-$14.95 for my book, with the shipping included.  Which looks strangely like what a "fairer price" for DRYH would be.  So maybe what I'm doing here is cutting into my margins to provide free shipping.  All sorts of perspective is possible here.  I'm chock full of perspective. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'm not yet certain, today, with the clout and "selling power" I have as a game manufacturer prior to <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/dryh.php" rel="nofollow">Don't Rest Your Head</a>'s release,  that the answers play out in a way that says I really did the wrong thing here.<br/><br/>From at least one perspective, I'm not selling an 84 page softcover product for $9.95 in order to make $3 per copy (though, admittedly, I was hoping to make back my production costs -- which I have).  I'm selling it so that you go, hey, Fred makes good games.  I'm going to move stuff that Evil Hat puts out up higher on my buying list.  Hell; when they come out with a [400 page 6x9 or 200 page 8.5x11] hardback priced at $40 or more, I'm gonna think that's probably worth plunking down my cash, because with pay products -- which Evil Hat's made none of before DRYH -- they've demonstrated the ability to deliver value.<br/><br/>What, precisely, is wrong with that thinking? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> That's really what I'm trying to dig at, here.<br/><br/>Thanks for getting this topic started!                        </div>

<p>Okay, first the low-hanging fruit:  Now ... I'm not an enemy of Lulu.  Clinton works at Lulu and they seem to be <em>really good folks</em> doing really good work, with some price-points in certain combinations that are <em>very</em> compelling.  But $6 for an 84 page softcover?  That doesn't strike me as a good price-point for your purposes.  It might well be for somebody who is selling less units, but you should be taking advantage of your high volume to reduce your prices.</p>
<p>You've sold 47 copies at $3 gross money for you on each.  You currently have no inventory, and have made $141.  Which is <em>good</em>, yes!</p>
<p>But suppose you'd done a run with a short-run print company, for 100 copies at (say) $3 each?  You'd spend $300 up front, then have sold 47 copies at $10 gross money for you on each.  You would have made $470 gross, minus your cost of $300, means $170 net profit to date.  <strong>And</strong> you'd have 53 books of inventory, which would be another $530 of money with no further costs, if you ended up selling them all (which you probably would).</p>
<p>Now 84 pages is a tricky page count (a little bit too big for 16-folio saddle-stitch, a little too small for really effective perfect binding) so you might not get as good a deal as $3.  You'd have to shop around.  But even at $4 (which I imagine you'd be able to find) you'd already be within about ten sales of catching up with the $6 POD, and from there on it's still all pure extra profit.</p>
<p>Like I said, that's low-hanging fruit.  If you're pretty sure you're going to sell 100 copies within a few months, it simply <em>makes more sense</em> to save money on a 100-copy run than to pay more for 100 1-copy runs.</p>
<p>Now, your price point.  Not the low-hanging fruit. :-)</p>
<p>Your argument ("How many less would I have sold at $13?") is, in economics terms, an argument about <em>elasticity</em>.  How much will people shift their buying to other products (or away from RPGs entirely) as your price rises, and conversely how much will they buy more of your product as your price falls?</p>
<p>You seem to be making the argument that demand for RPGs is extremely elastic, with respect to price.  The number of people who would buy at $13 is less than half the number who would buy at $10.</p>
<p>All my experience is that demand for RPGs is <em>in the long term</em> extremely <strong>inelastic</strong>.  Note the "in the long term."  RPGs generally, and indie RPGs particularly, tend to be evergreen products.  They continue to generate sales month after month, year after year, in a way that other products don't, and people can keep something "on their list" for years, but they <em>do</em> eventually buy.</p>
<p>What I am arguing here is that if you priced your product at $13 you would have had <strong>far fewer sales</strong> in your first four days.  Granted, without contest.  But I suspect that within a month or two, if you continued marketing (so that people don't forget about you) probably <em>90%</em> of the customers who bought at $10 would have eventually chosen to buy at $13.  In fact, I suspect that (if DRYH is a complete system) they'd buy at $15 ... possibly even at $20, though there is <em>some</em> elasticity as price rises.</p>
<p>So ... y'know ... not going with the distribution-retail chain?  I'm right with you there.  But pricing yourself deliberately low because you think your product isn't good enough to attract interest in any way other than a ridiculously low sticker price?  I've done the same thing, and concluded that it was a serious mistake.</p>

                            My .02 in relation to price-setting:<br/><br/>I have sold far more $26 books than $16 books with <i>the exact same text</i>. Color covers, perfect binding and full-color interior is apparentely worth the extra 10 bucks to a number of people. I've also sold more $16 books than $12 PDFs, and more $12 PDFs than $8 PDFs (I think...those two are pretty close). <br/><br/>Now, I don't want to get into profit margins and such.

                            This is something I wanted to touch on:
<blockquote>But suppose you'd done a run with a short-run print company, for 100 copies at (say) $3 each? You'd spend $300 up front, then have sold 47 copies at $10 gross money for you on each. You would have made $470 gross, minus your cost of $300, means $170 net profit to date. And you'd have 53 books of inventory, which would be another $530 of money with no further costs, if you ended up selling them all (which you probably would).</blockquote>
I'll grant you all of this.  But, even given what you say, consider this:
<ul><li>I don't want to deal with shipping.</li><li>I don't want to maintain my own inventory</li><li>I don't want to be responsible for taking payments for product</li></ul>
There are probably more items for that list, but let's start there.  Given these three issues, is it worth it to me to let a POD service like Lulu handle all of them -- and is it worth it to the tune of an extra $3 per book?  At this point, yes.<br/><br/>Using your example, I would have had to ship out all of those 47 copies -- so I'd have paid shipping to get the books to me in the first place, and then I'd either be giving away free shipping (cutting into the margin) or charging customers for S&amp;H, and getting out there and doing the shipping myself, each and every day.  As a largely one-man deal (Evil Hat is more than just me, but all of this stuff would be occurring where I'm located), shipping times would be vulnerable to my own schedule.  I go out of town for a week?  Nothing gets shipped for a week.  I'd also be storing the 53 remaining ones here.  <br/><br/>And honestly, none of that picture is really appealing to me.<br/><br/>To dig into the specifics of Lulu cost-to-print stuff, DRYH is a perfect-bound book and 84 pages.  Looking at <a href="http://www.lulu.com/help/index.php?fID=33#step3" rel="nofollow">the Lulu pricing structure</a>, the formula applies thus:<br/><br/>$4.53 as the base binding cost<br/>$0.02/page x 84 pages = $1.68 <br/>Total: $6.21 base production cost<br/><br/>Priced at $9.95 (yes, underpriced), that's $3.74, which Lulu takes 20% of, or 63 cents.  Which takes it down to about $3.11 profit on a sale.<br/><br/>Looking ahead to something like Spirit of the Century, which is gonna have at least 300 pages to it in the format we're looking at, we're talking a softcover base price of $4.53 + $6 = $10.53, and I'm going to be pricing it pretty significantly above $10.53, without needing to worry about any of the crap I don't want to have to deal with.  Regardless, I offer this to illustrate that larger pagecounts definitely blunt the impact of that binding fee portion, which is the real dealio behind the "high" per-copy cost.<br/><br/>I don't know that I really have a *point* here so much as a desire to have offered up more information so, uh, there. There it is. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Appreciate all the advice so far.  It's definitely factoring into my down-the-line decisions, so let me assure you it's not falling on deafness. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            What Tony said.  Plus, selfishly, if you are selling a quality game for ten bucks, people are going to see that and get their expectations all un-managed.

                            Here's a related issue which I find myself now facing, and maybe someone can speak to.<br/><br/>A LGS has agreed to stock a small number of my books. It seems that they are willing either to buy the books outright or take them on consignment. Them purchasing the books outright seems simpler and generally better for me (yes?). How much should I charge them?<br/><br/>Right now, I sell the game for $8 in pdf and $14 in print through lulu, without shipping. Those numbers are calibrated so that I make the same profit from either format. I figure that if I sold books in person, I'd charge $15 (easy to handle the bills, and makes up for the shipping fee).<br/><br/>I'm guessing that this LGS -- I need to talk to them more, but they seem flexible -- would like something like 50% off cover price. That would mean I sell them a book for $7 and make $0 profit. Obviously no good, and lulu's high cost is less acceptable when they're not even handling the sale.<br/><br/>I see having the books in a store as advertising mostly; I don't expect to sell a lot, or make much. But $0? What are others' experiences here?                        </div>

                            I think Jason has the right of it here. Pricing well below what the market will bear runs the risk of shifting the market's expectations. I go in expecting an indie game to cost me around $20 nowadays, and when I see a number a whole lot above <i>or below</i> that I am more cautious about the purchase than I normally would be. A really low price can cause potential customers to have doubts about a product's quality - why is it sooo cheap? Plus, the money you make today funds your next project as well as paying for the production costs of the current one.  You might not be in it for the money, but you need the money to keep your efforts going.<br/><br/>That said, Fred, your game sounds right up my alley, so I bought the print and PDF. I look forward to giving it a thorough read.<br/><br/>A related question for you publishing tycoons: Just how much money did you sink into your first product? How much do you think would be too much? It sounds like Fred got off relatively cheap by using inexpensive photos and such, which may explain his modest pricing goals. I'm betting if he had several hundred dollars wrapped up in art, software, etc. it would be a different story. <br/><br/>I love these kinds of threads, by the way. Demystifying the step from design to publishing is super useful.                        </div>

                            Hey Eric, I posted <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19041.0" rel="nofollow">hard numbers about the initial printing of The Roach</a>.  The second printing was 200 copies, and didn't really realize any economy of scale with RPI, although we got a marginally better deal on card printing and cutting.  <br/><br/>We pulled the trigger on Drowning and Falling yesterday and the printing cost was identical to The Roach, even though it is a 64-page book.   I've been very pleased with RPI's work so I didn't shop it around.  Their prices have gone up.<br/><br/>Regarding how much is too much, in my case it was simple - my wife and I agreed that I could spend anything I was certain to recover.  So our initial print run was very conservative.  Our first print run more than paid for our second.                        </div>

                            What do people think about the whole Colour Vs Black and White thing? I've been checking it out and it seems a full colour interior is MUCH more expensive. Does the apeal of a colour interior balance out with indie games as well as distribution model?<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering whether anyone has done much in the way of playing with how they release thier games. I'm playing about with doing a decent sized core PDF, several small add-on PDF's and then doing a full colour book that includes the whole lot. Is this something anyone has tried?                        </div>

But other fulfillment places provide the same service, and charge less.  I know my fulfillment guys ain't chargin' me no 30% of gross.</p>

<p>I ... don't think that's a big deal.  We're simply not that pervasive.  If White Wolf suddenly drops (or, far more likely, raises) the price of an entire supplement line, that can change what people expect for $20.  Us?  People just say "Man, I ripped that poor developer guy off!"</p>

<p>Alas, on this matter I cannot help people.  I don't do the whole "buying art" or "paying for layout" thing.  I just work my ass off, and I've already got a ton and a half of software from other enterprises.  I sunk about six hundred dollars into my first print run (extra costs for multiple proofing stages) though.  Does that count?</p>

<p>This basic principle should be graven in letters of fire upon a great marble slab, and that slab should then be used to smack prospective game developers in the face.</p>
<p>That is the statement of a person who is operating a business by spending money they have <em>already earned</em> rather than spending the money they <em>hope to earn</em>.  That's how you make a business where money trickles <em>out</em> rather than one where money pours <em>in</em>.  (EDIT:  Out, from the business, into your hands ... rather than out of your hands and into the business ... sorry, that was unclear)</p>
<p>Now <strong>that</strong> is where I see the huge strength of Lulu in this market.  They let you bootstrap off of a pure and undiluted strategy of "no external investment."  I could <em>totally</em> recommend the following strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out precisely how much a print run of 100 copies is going to cost you.  </li>
<li>Sell through Lulu until your pure-profit accumulates that much money.  </li>
<li>Plow that profit into a short print run.  </li>
<li>Ship that short print run directly to a pre-arranged fulfillment house and seamlessly switch your sales over to them.  </li>
<li>Use the profit from the first 100-copy batch to pay for the next one <strong>plus</strong> pay for you to attend cons, advertise your book, etc.  </li>
<li>When you have enough left-over money for a larger print run, do a larger print run instead of a smaller.  Profits increase, and you have to do print runs less often.</li>
<li>Eventually get bored of marketing and expanding, and just let things run in the same profitable rut, spending your excess profits on posh lifestyle (get the <em>fancy</em> ramen, and maybe some <em>imported</em> beers!)</li>
</ul>
<p>That bootstrapping from nothing has a great deal of appeal to me, particularly because <em>at any point in the process</em> (including before your first sale) the whole thing can collapse and you can walk away with a fun experience that paid for itself.</p>

Yeah. I was pretty timid about it too, which is why you'll see that the strategy that I adopted neatly dodges such a thing.  I'm not shelling out any cash for the books, aside from the art expenses, which have already been covered at this point.
<blockquote>Regarding your latter concerns about retail logistics, isn't that what IPR is for?</blockquote>
Well, is it?  I know they do some direct sales, but, is it possible to sign up with someone like them (or Key20) and say, look, just skip the whole distribution thing, I can't handle my books being sold to FLGSes at 40% of cover?<br/><br/>If the answer's yes, well, cool.  Though it still leaves me with an (as-yet-unspoken) concern.  If I'm printing a run of books in advance, rather than doing POD -- setting aside questions who stores them for me and how much it costs me for the books to just sit there unsold -- where do I get the cash to print the run of books in advance?<br/><br/>The funds I have for Evil Hat right now are all earmarked for other projects.  So from a certain perspective, DRYH doesn't have the $500 (or whatever) up front for a 100-copy print run in the first place.<br/><br/>When I have that cash in the DRYH column, and I bump up the cover price, looking to something other than just Lulu will work out fine for me.  But if I'm looking to provide an evergreen product that only incurs cost at the time of sale, POD is still pretty attractive to me.  It just might not be attractive for the bigger projects later on in my calendar.                        </div>

                            You can ask Brennan not to offer your products to retailers. And IPR doesn't sell to distribution anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, as you mention, you need to print the books first.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about this process (which is basically what Tony outlined):<br/>
<br/>
- Do what you're doing with lulu. While this is happening, get quotes from other places for (say) a 100-book run. Get a dollar amount that it will cost you. Talk to IPR now too.<br/>
- Wait until you've earned that dollar amount from your lulu sales. Then get your 100 books ordered, and have them sent directly to IPR.<br/>
- Enjoy the sales from both outlets.<br/>
<br/>
This was basically my original plan with Timestream (though then I signed up with Key20, which messed up the plan. That's a matter for another post).                        </div>

                            This discussion reminds me - does anyone have an interest in contributing to a kind of anthology of small, i.e. "rules-light", story-games (say, a dozen games averaging 10 pages, no more than 20-25 for any individual game)? I think that would be a good product for people who like to try a number of games out, or who want a book that they can pull out at any time and quickly find an easy-setup game for a given number of people. It would also mean that you could get some stuff published in book form which is too short to publish on its own.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be a book editor, so I would be happy to copy-edit something like this if people wanted to contribute.                        </div>

                            Mike, have you seen the <a href="http://www.nopress.net/" rel="nofollow">Nopress RPG Anthology</a>? It's along the same lines, and its totally awesome. That said, gimme more details and I'll tell you whether I'm interested...<br/><br/>At some point in the near future, I plan to write up a post detailing my entry into self-publishing, with some numbers. I want to wait, though, either until after 2nd- quarter info is in, or until after GenCon, depending on how the rest of my life goes.<br/><br/>Long story short: because of my contract with Key20, I had to pony up more dough for printing up-front than I had initially planned to. However, I now have books in traditional distribution. I'm waiting to get my final 2nd-quarter numbers back before I decide whether this was a good move or a mistake on my part.                        </div>

                            OK, looks like it was an even more obvious idea than I thought. (Doesn't make it a bad one, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking along the lines of: a deadline (which always helps me produce), a requirement of N rounds of playtest/revision (N &gt;= 3), and probably not a lot else as requirements for entry (except maybe restricting it to current members of this forum?). I was also thinking that a table of contents at the front showing the recommended number of players for each game, the dice (etc.) required, the approximate playing time if applicable, and the genre would help the user find an appropriate game for their group nice and quickly. So each entry would have to provide those things.<br/>

                            I'm not certain that anthologies, on the whole, are a good idea.  I had a good experience participating in the No Press, but if I could do it over I would sell my game as its own thing.<br/>
<br/>
Fundamentally, packaging anthology games seperately, with enough supporting text to play them well, is better for the consumer and the producer.<br/>

<p>Mostly, I'll just point at Tony and put my finger on (this time, not "in") my nose.</p>
<p><strong>Selling</strong></p>
<p>IPR now carries the game (as well as the glyphpress site) because I've screwed up more orders than I wish and Brennan knows what he's doing. I'm still carrying it because that way I make more money per order, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Printing</strong></p>
<p>I'm having RPI print Shock: because they're the only folks who seem able to manage the weird print specs for the book (unusual cover stock, with matte film). It will cost a little bit more than UtB to produce (around $5), but I'm charging $7 more per copy because a) it's a better game in many ways and b) $16 isn't quite enough to cover the effort I've put into the game.</p>
<p>Because it's in the form of a deck of cards, Under the Bed has unusual print specs. I print it locally. There's no price break (or, rather, one that doesn't matter) until I do like 400 decks, but the cost/deck is around $4, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion</strong></p>
<p>Brennan's got UtB at Origins right now doing publicity that I couldn't possibly do (even if I wasn't honeymooning while he was there). He's doing all sorts of promotion that I can't do. What I'm doing is being on places like Story Games, the Forge, and RPGnet, tracking hits to my site to see what makes people talk about Shock: and not being a dick on those fora.</p>
<p>What really sells games, so far, seems to be Actual Play reports; it's clear evidence that people enjoy the game. Deeply contextual threads also sell games; the game is part of the conversation.</p>
<p>Luke Crane has done a lot of research into online presence. Here are two things he's said that I remind myself:</p>
<p>1: Banner ads don't help you and they're expensive. You get hits but not sales.</p>
<p>2: Don't respond to baiting online.</p>
<p>3: Be earnest and personable in fora.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, that's three things. Three things I remind myself. Oh, and never give up the rights to your own work. Four. Four things.</p>

<blockquote>Fundamentally, packaging anthology games seperately, with enough supporting text to play them well, is better for the consumer and the producer.</blockquote>
I have mixed feelings about that. If the games can be played as is, then put 'em in an anthology. If they need the extra stuff, then don't. Knowing which game is which is the hard part.<br/><br/>For a designer, I think anthologies can act as a great starting point in publishing. Lessons can be learned and experience garnered, older hands can help give a step up to the new guy...                        </div>

                            Bully Pulpit Games has been doing all of our printing with <a href="http://rpiprint.com/" rel="nofollow">RPI</a> so far, and as Jason said, we're pretty satisified.  The rep we'd been working with just left the company and I'm waiting to see how responsive her replacement is, but so far my experience has been that they are responsible, professional, and willing to work with small-change print jobs like ours.  <br/><br/>Our cost for the first run of the <em>Roach</em> was $4.59/book, at 78 perfect bound pages with a glossy color cover.  We did end up saving some money on the second run by increasing the print order to 200- the cost was roughly $3.35/book, including a $60 charge for additional changes after the proof came back.  <br/><br/>We ended up getting the same price for our (100 book) run of <em>Drowning and Falling</em> as we did on the <em>Roach</em>, but they made it clear that their costs have gone up, and that we should expect to pay around $510 in the future.                        </div>

<p>I printed <em>Capes</em> with these guys.  What impressed the hell out of me is that they were the <em>only</em> people who told me that they were <em>too busy</em> during the dates I originally wanted to print (even though I was talking to them three months in advance).  Instead we agreed that I would provide them the files a few weeks earlier, during a lull for them, and they would be able to do the job.</p>
<p>I fear for the customers of printers who simply say yes without really thinking through what their workload is for a particular time, and just hope to make a miracle happen later on.  It was very reassuring to hear "No, we'll be at capacity those two weeks, and I <strong>will not take your business</strong> if I am not absolutely certain that we can get the job done."</p>

                            Thanks for the information about RPI.  Definitely something to go to my rolodex!<br/><br/>And -- hey.  I realized something today.  I went and looked to see what kind of bulk order discount I'd get from Lulu.com if I ordered up 100 copies of the book, myself.  While individual printings of the book are in the mid-$6 range, getting 100 all at once knocks a hefty bit off the price -- with shipping included, I'd be paying more like $4.75/book.  Which sounds to be more in the price range of other small-run printers...                        </div>

                            Ah, it warms my heart to see this earnest debate continue (on down through the ages). <br/>
<br/>
This was the culmination of the debate for me.<br/>
http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=11266.0<br/>
I used to get roundly berated by Ralph Mazza and others for the price of BWC.<br/>
<br/>
Fred, you do what's right for your heart! I sold BWC at $15 (for 550 pages of material). I sold 1000 copies in 18 months and made enough money to create and print a nice supplement. Once the initial print run was gone, Instead of reprinting, I revised and raised the price to $25. I've sold nearly twice as many copies (in 2/3s the time) at the new price. And the new price affords me many of the luxurious necessities that BW demands: cons, lunch, other games and funding insane projects like Burning Empires.<br/>
<br/>
When I got started, I underpriced BW for a number of reasons, many of them idealistic (hence the "go with your heart" comment). I did have one marketing reason: BW was just another fantasy rpg; I needed to give people hefy incentive to try it out. It worked. From that initial print run I gathered the aforementioned money, plus critical praise plus a loyal fan base. All due to the price tag? No, but it was definitely part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Jason you said, "Plus, selfishly, if you are selling a quality game for ten bucks, people are going to see that and get their expectations all un-managed." This is just bunk bunk bunk. Fred undervaluing his game is not going to change the pricing expectation of the gaming community. The world survived WotC underpricing the 3.0 PHB and DMG, it survived me underpricing BW, and it'll survive Fred underpricing his game. The price of rpgs has only ever gone up. <br/>

                            Sure. It took a day to gel in my head what exactly I was talking about.<br/><br/>The content of a game helps determine its pricing. Burning Wheel is a Fantasy game in a sea of Fantasy games. You have to play it to find out that it's actually one of the <i>best</i> ones. So you have to get it in peoples' hands. Getting it in peoples' hands means pricing it low. <i>I</i> sure wouldn't have bought a fantasy game for more than $25, and you were charging, what, $15? Is that right? It practically leapt off the shelf into my arms because of the book design, and the pricetag meant I could take it home without trying, the little tramp.<br/><br/>If I'm making a game with little or no competition Ã¢â‚¬â€ a game about race car drivers, or role-playing forest creatures in their attempts at saving the world Ã¢â‚¬â€ the price point isn't an issue for people who are into the idea. I just have to figure out what the price point is for people who a) want this game and b) don't want to feel like they're taking too big of a monetary risk.<br/><br/>Fortunately. the big publishers have done a lot of our work for us: D&amp;D and GURPS cost like $70 for the basic books and WoD games are  $40 for the worldbook and your monster of choice. So, given the current pricing range of Forge games that I know about ($12 - $26, I think), we're already competing on price and might not have to.<br/><br/>However, if your game's going to fit within an established genre of game, you'll be competing with other games. For instance, Shock: will be competing with Transhuman Space ($25, plus optional $50 basic books) and Traveller ($22 to $28 plus the D&amp;D Player's Guide, $18, or GURPS basic books, depending on which system you want to ignore) to a certain extent, even though the differences are stark.<br/><br/>Shock: is the same price, more or less: $23. If I want to convert SF roleplayers en masse, you might be right: I should price it lower. If I'm confident that players who will enjoy it will find the game anyway because two games doesn't make a "sea" of competition, I shouldn't.<br/><br/>For the record, I don't think your success is because of your low price. I think your success is because of your excellent product and fanatical devotion to its promotion. But the pricing almost certainly gave you a leg up. I'm sure glad you raised it, though.                        </div>
