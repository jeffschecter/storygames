The latter now uses the same rule as car chases or archery contests.<br/><br/>I didn't realize it when I read Diaspora, but I experienced in play, the mismatch of conflicting goals in its social combat system. You win by arranging the participants to get to certain goal spots on a map, but you can also deal damage to each other. But why would you, if the goal is to get to a certain point? Our experience was that our players didn\u2019t know what to do, sometimes trying to move the enemy NPC, sometimes trying to harm them.<br/><br/>One game that does seem to model battles of wits as "taking the other out" is Phoenix Wright. You are attorney trying to undermine the opponents case and it looks like, if viewed in Fate terms, that it's modeled via stress tracks on either side. It works well there (what doesn't work is mixing the metaphors, as our table repeatedly ended up doing with Diaspora).<br/><br/>However, if I would do a court scene in Fate, I'd either just make it a contest (a.k.a. car chase rules) or I'd make the case it self a character. It could have aspects like "Counsel is privately affected" and skills like "present new evidence". The GM would run a fight vs this character narrated as the prosecutor and judge and witnesses saying or doing stuff, but in the mechanics it's the "case" chararacter that's the enemy.<br/><br/>That\u2019s to say, just like the haunted houses in GURPS Creatures of the Night, the megacorps in Cyberpunk 3, and the fire in Fight Fire. As an aside, where was this technique first seen? I know Maykrantz did Creatures before Cyberpunk\u2019s ill-fated third edition came out.<br/>I think Fate explains it the clearest, though, with the very specific skills.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424605/#Comment_424605" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T06:54:02+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  6:54AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread started on my thread on a half baked idea of social conflict done with cards. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18930/half-baked-idea-about-miniatures-social-combat-and-stories-without-role-playing#Item_8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18930/half-baked-idea-about-miniatures-social-combat-and-stories-without-role-playing#Item_8</a><br/><br/>I can see the problem of mixing social conflict with combat - usually the peaceful approach doesn't work when the other side has guns. I referred to one incident in 1652 Paris when it did work but that exception really proves the rule. <br/><br/>This might not matter in the games I described in the thread though because most action is handled by action cards. Players use them to tell stories, but when a conflict comes up like a fight or a social conflict, players can pull out a second deck of cards to run the conflict. Best not to mix a social deck with a combat deck but the idea is to use a separate system to handle fights rather than use the action cards for everything. When I've done that, fights are just too fast. <br/><br/>Does switching from and action system to a card combat system constitute mixing metaphors? I don't think so. I think it gets at what you are saying about not mixing them. It is a very half baked idea though so I can't say what it will work out as in testing. For me though using words rather than numbers makes for a more compelling social game. Card combat just moves though what could be role played quicker - which fits the miniatures story game it was intended for. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424612/#Comment_424612" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T07:40:37+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  7:40AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the link.

I meant trying to get the other character Taken Out, be that embarrassing them, catching them with a lie, or what have you.<br/><br/>In the game Diaspora, there are separate mechanics for causing stress and consequences (which leads to being Taken Out) vs moving people towards your favored outcome. These got mixed up at our table which lead to muddy social conflicts.<br/><br/>In contrast, the other game, Fate Core, is very clear between \u201ctrying to win a contest\u201d vs \u201ctrying to knock each other out\u201d\u2014you can transition between them well, but there is less chance of mixing it up.<br/><br/>In both of these contexts, both \u201cattacks\u201d and \u201cmovements\u201d can take on the flavor properties of your example social conflict cards, like Request, Restate your position, etc, but they are mechanically different.<br/><br/>One attacks the other participant via a mechanical feature, \u201cStress tracks and consequences\u201d. The other reaches for a goal or conclusion (say a decision in a social situation) via another mechanical feature, \u201cCounting victories\u201d. Either of these can be done with either skill, such as Knife Fighting, Charming, Lying, Intimidation, Semantics, Hand Grenade Throwing, Bike Riding, (if they fit the context in the fiction) and can be any type of disagreement, be it physical or mental or social.<br/><br/>Which explains why you could easily accidentally mix them up in Diaspora and why I\u2019m glad Fate Core makes it clearer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424625/#Comment_424625" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T14:12:16+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  2:12PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Were you plying <i>Diaspora</i> with the SRD rules, or did you have the full commercial game with the examples? Because the distinction seemed pretty clear in the "Changing History" example --- the mechanical stress-and-consequences rules were used when one participant was attacking the other, and by "attacking" I mean doing something in the fiction that reads as an attack. The examples in the book involved the PCs engaging in a smear campaign against the Opposition Party, and later exposing the OP's agents. <br/><br/>I think this only becomes muddy if you have a space on the board representing something that reads as an attack in the fiction, or if you're used to using stress-and-consequences for stuff that doesn't seem attack-like.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424627/#Comment_424627" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T15:12:13+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  3:12PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This maps interestingly to one of the core questions asked about Marvel Heroic Roleplaying: "Why would I use Stress <b>and</b> Complications?" Naturally, one excellent answer is "You don't need to use them both at the same time, but your choice is governed by the way in which you want to take someone out. Maybe you want to put the hurt on (and make them remember you), maybe you want to maneuver them out of the fight."<br/><br/>I think it's ultimately about giving players options in the course of the conflict. Your character is defined by the choices they make, and this is one way to give them more choices.<br/><br/>It's really ultimately the same thing as having a D&amp;D fight with two options: hold the "capture point" for three rounds, or kill all enemies. If you take the opposition out, you win by default...but is that a price you're willing to pay?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424670/#Comment_424670" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T11:08:51+00:00" title="November 23, 2013 11:08AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was actually looking at the Changing History example just as I wrote it. I also have some similar, fictional examples up in the files section on rpggeek, called something like "abstract combat example".<br/><br/>In the Changing History example, they do such attacks on turn five and eight and end up Taking Out the OP. But they still don't get what they want since they're not in the right goal boxes.<br/>Similar things happened at our table. I am not satisfied with this. YMMV.<br/><br/>What would happen was that it was not clear to all how to best approach these "board games". Barriers, direct compsure attacks, forced movements... <br/><br/>I loved it those first few sessions, but after the fourth, the accumulated murk and unclarity caused me to give up on Fate altogether. I missed the kickstarter and only just this week gave Fate Core a chance but I'm blown away. (Except that it sucks that they use Google services so much for their community.)<br/><br/>When I read Fate Core it was clear to me that harm is harm and not always appropriate. In the future I want to set up very clear stakes and procedures rather than a tangled up boardgame.<br/><br/>What I liked about the subgames was that it was a way to turn a confusing sitation into something clear and with clear outcomes. It was as welcome as water in the desert to see these clear maps of power struggles and heists.

Then, during combat you could choose to attempt to unnerve your opponent (who would defend with something like "resolve", or "banter.") and inflict mental stress. You would need to damage people through both stress boxes to really stack the results, but once you did I think you'd have a very potent combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you could run a Conflict and a Contest concurrently. Like if you are competing in a medieval tournament while also trying to impress the Queen. This allows for a Conflict loss with a Contest win, or vice versa, and have some interesting role play fall out. I can really see this in a Japanese Medieval setting where you lose the fight to save face, or something along those lines.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439914/#Comment_439914" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T18:33:03+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  6:33PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So this is a bit of a thread necro but the switch to the vanilla version made me see that I had unanswered posts here, including from J B Bell.<br/>Diaspora gave us some good sessions and I hope I was clear about that, how happy it made us for a brief while. In the end, I as GM ended the campaign.<br/>"Changing History": it sounds like you had fun but it also looks like a game that doesn't really know what the goal is. Moving to the boxes or taking out the OP.<br/><br/>Fate Core: I had a couple of good sessions with Fate Core too but I realized that it was really hard to create good opposition. Everything is either WAY too easy or (rarely) a little too hard. That's "gamist", I know. But...<br/>Also I should've prepped more. I come from a background of improvising everything and I definitely underprepped our Fate Core games. I used "Crime World", from World's in Shadow, I was enamored by it's clarity but ended up thinking it created too linear, almost boring, situations in actual play.<br/><br/>Thanks to all who have worked on Fate and variants over the years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
