So, so good, and one of the best sessions I've ever played.<br/><br/>My question: we only had 4 players, including myself, so we tossed the King. (That is, the King was not a PC.) Given just 4 players, would you have tossed the King or another character?<br/><br/>The King was played as an NPC as the fiction demanded it, and the Earl and the Seidkona and the Princess didn't feel slighted by his not being a PC. The Knight seems like a bit of an odd, Joker-style character, and his story was played out as being rather more entwined with the Princess and the Earl.<br/><br/>The text doesn't give any advice about which character to toss if you only have 4 players: the first line is that LitToS is a game for 5 players, so that's fine. We might have played another game, but I was very keen to play LitToS, and so having gathered 3 other players I wasn't about to let the opportunity pass.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310319/#Comment_310319" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T17:11:48+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  5:11PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2011 5:49PM by nemomeme.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe Jason told me the Princess is a reasonable choice to exclude and the the Earl seems another likely possibility.  <br/><br/>Strictly speaking, Love in the Time of Sei\xf0 has no NPCs.  Each of the four LitToS games I've played has had at least a handful of really wonderful supporting characters outside the five "main" ones.  In one case, the King's ghostly queen was at least as interesting as any of the other characters.  Having a main character relegated to supporting status need not make it significantly less integral and the main characters are linked well enough in most cases such that setting any one of them aside gently should work fine.  Just don't "toss" them and, equally, don't rule out the possibility of  the Earl's messenger or the King's brother being absolutely compelling when the spotlight player asks you to pick up their mantle.<br/><br/>With three players, though, I would might choose a different game.  I haven't tried playing with only three.<br/><br/>LitToS/Archipelago II is one of my very favorite games.  Its system engages and transports its participants such that all the characters really come to life for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310331/#Comment_310331" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T18:30:23+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  6:30PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The relationships are composed of interlocking triangles. I've played without the Princess (twice) and without the Knight. <br/><br/>I think any one personality could become the utility character depending on the group's vibe that evening. <br/><br/>I'm so glad you had fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
