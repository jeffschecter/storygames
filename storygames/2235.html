                    Years ago I bought a file case to carry around my papers and books.  (Pictured with Optimus Prime for a sense of scale.)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rps.net/QS/Images/case1.jpg"/><br/><br/>After a while I realized it had two drawbacks.  First, it was a bit small.  With folders and papers, I could fit only 2 or 3 standard-sized RPG corebooks.  Two, it didn't have a good way to carry pencils or other small items.  Yesterday I got a Rubbermaid file case of the same style at OfficeMax.  (Picture below is clear with a green lid, but mine was black.)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rps.net/QS/Images/case2.jpg"/><br/><br/>I was happy because it was everything I wanted.  It even had the same visual style, down to the inverse ribbing on the lid, my old one had.<br/><br/>The first time I opened it and let the lid fall of its own weight, the lid fell off the hinges.<br/><br/>The second time, the outer two hinges (of four) snapped off and flew around the room.<br/><br/>What a bummer.  When I got it home and showed it to my wife, she told me she had the same design and it had the same problem.  Sure enough, when she pulled it out of storage, the same two hinges were snapped off of hers.  A return trip to OfficeMax confirmed this is a design problem.  Several others had broken hinges.  Another Rubbermaid case of the same size but different design even had snapped hinges.  So I returned the Rubbermaid and got this instead (also pictured with Jetfire for moral support):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rps.net/QS/Images/case3.jpg"/><br/><br/>The mack daddy of RPG cases?  It's even bigger than the Rubbermaid one.  It measures 10" deep at the base, a foot tall.  It even has rubber wheels and a telescoping handle for rolling.  No worries about the weight of the lid snapping the handles because it only opens about 80 degrees.  That's a bit of mark against it, though it has tabs to lock it in an open position so you can access the interior without it falling closed.  It's a bit bigger than I wanted (a bit of a monster honestly).  I certainly won't be running out of room any time soon.<br/><br/>How common are cases like these among gamers?  Or do you find that you just don't carry around enough books/papers make one necessary?<br/><br/><br/>P.S. Hopefully Andy will verify that I am not a marketing plant. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            My regular group dislikes games that require learning lots of rules (games that I can mostly explain in 15 minutes or less are fine though), so I can always fit all of my game stuff (a paperback, usually of no more than 200 pages, pencils, dice, notebook/binder) into my messenger bag or backpack.<br/><br/>Still, if I was regularly playing, say, Exalted or D&amp;D, I would seriously be inspired to go out and buy one of those wheeled carrying cases. Like, I'd go out and get one early tomorrow, so I could have it to show off to my friends by our next game session. From purely anecdotal, not-really-paying-attention type stuff, in my neck of the woods I think hard plastic cases are more common for people who are hauling minis around, whether for D&amp;D or Warhammer.                        </div>

                            I'm impressed and a little bit scared by the amount of books and notes that people are (apparently) hauling around.  Do you actually use all that material in a session?<br/>
<br/>
Me, I bought an aluminum briefcase (the kind for upscale transport of laptops and office-shmutz), and went looking for foam to customize it.  I found some lovely grid-cut open-cell foam that the game store was selling for people to make custom holders for their mini collections.  To the right of the area where I keep books and folders, I used a square of that foam to make a holding area for three cubes of d6s, a pack of 3x5 cards and a set of poker chips.<br/>
<br/>
That's my mack-daddy convention kit, but obviously it holds only a tiny fraction of the books and papers you guys lug around.  Still, it's got style.                        </div>

                            I ended up GMing my Tuesday group's Mutants &amp; Masterminds campaign without a rulebook because I'd taken it out of my old case the previous week to make room for the books I needed for my Wednesday group.  I figure if they can all co-exist in one case, I don't have to worry about my failing memory.  As much.                        </div>

                            For my recent game night I hunted around in my sofa for dice, printed out some Panty explosion Student Records and completely forgot about pencils. I thought I was pretty prepared. But when the Portland Indie Gamers group showed up (notably Joel) with cases of character sheets, dice sorted by type, size and color, poker chips, tokens and all kinds of other weird stuff I felt really, really underdressed.<br/>
<br/>
My usual plan is to just show up. If I remember to bring a book, characetr sheet or a pencil I consider that a bonus. I rarely think to bring dice. But thats just me. I regularly game with Travis Brown who has a nice big treasure chest (really) full of those things. maybe I depend to much on others?<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Quintin Stone</cite>How common are cases like these among gamers?</blockquote>
Hah. There's two answers:<br>Before I met Quintin:  Rare. Never seen one.<br>About a year after meeting Quintin: Damn, these things are EVERYWHERE!<br><br>So yeah, after Quintin, Rick, Scott and I formed our bi-weekly group some, what, almost three years ago, Quintin brought the above (smaller) plastic case, which neatly contained all the books and folders needed for play.  Scott was new to gaming, but Rick and I stared at that thing in awe.  Cut to about two weeks later, Rick had bought the same sized one, and I purchased the above "green top" sized one.  Yes, it's huge, and yeah one third of one of the lid hinges broke.  It's great, though, I pretty much rely on it for conventions, or parties where I need to bring 1-2 RPGs and a board game or two (currently I have three gaming books, two dice bags, RA and Citadels in mine. And in that top plastic piece you can store pencils and dice and stuff, too.<br><br>Yeah, and after Mark C and others saw MINE, they bought ones themselves.  So it's pretty much a plague that's spreading up and down the East Coast. AND NOW IT'S ON THE INTERNETS!<br><br>As it turns out, it's not too useful for single gaming sessions, it's just too big (and I don't play games that require a library for reference). I much prefer a smaller one. I usually bring my briefcase to my regular gaming group, but I too was considering getting one of the top "small" cases like the one that started this all for use with my weekly gaming group. The "fit two or three core books, a file or two, and a small set of dice" works perfectly for single session/weekly games.<br><br>Maybe next year I'll get a coffin to carry stuff in:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.guitarampsonline.com/Coffin_ATC_125.JPG"/><br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Wow.<br><br/>I have a similar reaction to Tony: Awe and a hint of fear. (With quite  abit amusement thrown in, though.) Me, I just use my usual backpack, but then I can't remember the last tim eI actually carried more then, like a single book to a game. Most of the time, I don't even carry that, just a bunch of dice and my usual "I won't leave the house without this" stuff, like a bunch of notebooks, a few sketchblocks, maybe a book I'm reading or a cd player and a whole bunch of different things to draw with. (A few mechanical pencils, a regular pencil or two, a bunch of fineliners, a fountain pen, maybe a few bits of graphite or charcoal, sometimes a small watercolor set or a quill and ink, ...) Well, and probably a printout of the Wushu rules or something.<br/><br/>(I always hated having to carry around tons of heavy books when playing games like Shadowrun or Vampire...)<br/><br/>That said, when I ever have money to spare, I'll defenitly get something like Tonys aluminium briefcase, because that sounds awesome. ^_^                        </br></div>

                            For years I've carried everything in a book bag - he kind that has gone out of style to be replaced by backpacks once again. It's got places for writing implements, pockets perfect for dice, and different compartments for books. It's a little hard on perfect-bound books, but I'm not too concerned.<br/>
<br/>
I usually carry around about five sets of rules. But these days that's not too much. Most of the space is taken up with scenario print outs for stuff I intend to run. I don't know that I'd bother to carry around any rules set that required a lot of space these days, like the other say above. If I can't play the game entirely from memory 99% of the time, then it's got too much stuff in the rules. I want games that play on principles, not on detailed rules for how to do just X or precisely Y.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at a SRD game called "Basic Fantasy RPG" yesterday in PDF format. It's something between Basic D&amp;D and AD&amp;D1 boiled down to essentials. It was proffered as an "easy" version of D&amp;D, suitable for kids. And all I could think of looking at it was, "Man, there are rules in here for grenade scatter" (which, given potion throwing is key to the whole fantasy genre, no?)<br/>
<br/>
The point is that the book could have gotten rid of half of it's contents, and still been way more complex in terms of having to look things up than, say, DitV. Kids can play The Princes' Kingdom, because they never have to read anything, for instance (my boy is 6, and just learning). They can understand how the game works from just the few mechanics that get used in play.<br/>
<br/>
If more people thought this way about play, then those wheeled monstrosities wouldn't be neccessary.<br/>

                            Years ago back in college, I started using a Rubbermaid file case frequently for gaming. Over the years, I've gone through a variety of ways to organize my game materials for portability (even if the portability is just to get from one room to the other in the house).<br/><br/>I've used backpacks (and in high school, I even used a ruck sack for a while - loaded with 50 lbs of books and lead miniatures). Back packs are handy in leaving your hands free, but when stuffed full, often damage the corners of books. Also, they aren't very usefull for organizing your books while playing.<br/><br/>The file cases are great, you can mix books and hanging file folders. The lid is usually tall enough above the books that a small bag of dice will fit in it (the cover compartment really doesn't hold enough dice for my tastes). Before I lost it when a brief case got stolen, I had a bamboo cigar tray that I used for dice rolling. It fit into the case also (usually holding some pens and stuff also). I use a file case today with folders for PCs, NPCs, dead characters, blank sheets, reference materials, campaign notes, etc. It also sometimes will have some game books in it. The file case sits near my chair (living room play space), and open or closed, serves as a bit of a table for a book or two that are actively being looked at.<br/><br/>I've used a brief case when playing a game that had but a few books. I rarely play games that would really fit well into a brief case though. Most either have too many books, or don't even need as much space as a brief case. Plus, I currently don't own a decent brief case.<br/><br/>For the past almost 5 years, I have been almost exclusively playing at home, and my needs of transport have been minimal. It's looking like I will soon have to play outside the home occaisionally now. I'll have to figure out how to reasonably transport my game materials (let's see, need Arcana Evolved, PH, DMG, MM, Ptolus, current module, character sheets and other notes, a notebook of supplemental rules and setting material, at least a few other books - probably won't all fit in one of these file cases).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

Yeah, those damn Zuca bags. Which I thought were insane. I mean, $120-$145 for a small bag? What justifies the cost? The uncomfortable built-in seat? No, wait...it must be the flashing LEDs in the wheels. WTF? I thought I was on crazy pills. Thanks for reminding me of my (only slightly) irrational hatred for these things, Kevin.

                            When I look at a bag the very first litmus test is whether it has hard dividers for file folders. (And messenger bags always fail the test.) I never carry 8.5 x 11 hardcover core books these days. It's always file folders of prep notes and/or printouts of rules documents and/or small softcover rulebooks. So the bag must have hard dividers to protect this stuff from flopping over and folding and basically getting all trashed down into the bottom of the bag in transit. And it's never a thick stack of this stuff either. My current bag is a Japanese Dr. Ion bag I bought from J-List. It's supposedly A4 sized, but actually just a bit larger, so it just barely crunches the tabs on file folders when I zip it shut. <br><br>And despite the litmust test, it doesn't have file dividers. But it does have the next best thing: a full size surface back pocket into which I was able to slip a stiff piece of cardboard that gives the whole bag structure.<br/><br/>That said, I'm pretty much constantly looking for my next bag. Any recommendations on a slim profile bag with file dividers?<br/><br/>Paul                        </br></br></div>

                            I'm partial to messenger bags and backpacks (more the first), and have a pretty sizable collection.  When I'm running a campaign, I'll keep much of the support kitted and ready to go. I picked up a nice rustic leather messenger bag that fits my iBook and my general kit a few weeks ago (at <a href="http://www.darkcon.org" rel="nofollow">DarkCon</a>) which I'm pretty happy with right now.<br/><br/>Especially these days, I'm making a general point of going light on books, so it's a few digest sized books, or a traditional hardcover, and a folder of papers or two, dice bag, etc.                        </div>

                            So far I've been a life long cyclist, I have never been qualified by a state to drive, so I use backpacks. Years ago when games required books, not these tiny zines that are all the fashion now-a-days, I used to have a huge Blue backpack. It was made by Bill-a-bong, or whatever surf company had the cred back then. It was a wet-suit backpack so it was waterproof, from the inside at least. I used to carry tons of books in that thing. Enough books to equal the volume of the Thanksgiving dinner I made one year, which I carried in that pack. 12-14 Pound turkey, potatoes, gallon of milk, and everything else. I've never seen it's like since. Now I'm forced to carry smaller amounts of groceries, and books.                        </div>

                            Hey all, after thinking about it for a while and prepping for GenCon, I decided to score a Crumpler brand bag, this one called The Cashmere Blazer:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.crumplerbags.com/Cart/Resources/CartResources/200_res/b200_o10636_ai1175.jpg"/><br/><br/>It was, unfortunately, a total orgy of storage. I got it for GenCon, but I could actually put all of GenCon inside of it. It was simply TOO big. And not in a way I could effectively use. I was able to basically fill it with the equivalent of 10 copies of Spirit of the Century, but because of this inner pocket thing the bag bunches up a lot.<br/><br/>So I decided to downgrade, and am currently exchanging it for a Horseman, a slightly smaller but similar model, with one internal main storage area and no split-pocket. It should be here by Sat or Mon, I'm really looking forward to it:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.crumplerbags.com/Cart/Resources/CartResources/199_res/b199_o10632_ai1172.jpg"/><br/><br/>I realized that it could hold everything that I possibly planned on bringing to run and play games, and on top of that it holds my 17" laptop in a secure padded compartment as well! Score!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I used to have a giant thrift-store suitcase filled with nothing but Paranoia forms I made with Appleworks on my Apple IIe that I brought to cons in the Phoenix area between 1989 and 1992.  The suitcase got to be famous.                        </div>

                            Let me add that I know exactly what Andy means about too much storage.  The giant case that started this thread?  Retired from RPG work.  Instead, I'm using the green-lidded Rubbermaid case pictured in the original post.  Yeah, two of the four hinges are snapped off and the lid is cracking and falls off if you let it fall open, but it does hold my books and papers for transport.                        </div>
