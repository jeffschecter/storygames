This is because I've been preparing a playtest document and getting ready for a con this weekend, but apologies to Ben for the delay.<br/><br/>So last weekend myself and a couple friends got together and played a game of Microscope. We came up with human survivors fleeing the machine takeover of earth, and eventually arriving on a new planet. Bookends were "The last days of earth" and "The founding of the first major city". Palette had Yes: Alien Flora and Fauna, Survival difficulties No: Sentient aliens, robots.<br/><br/>Major concerns were primarily with some difficulty moving scenes along, the first of which was "Why were some of the crew jettisoned?" It felt very forced, and it seemed to me that the player playing the Haulage Chief, whom from his thoughts was responsible for the incident, was playing his cards awfully close to the chest. As a result the scene eventually felt quite aimless. I'm not certain why we felt so adrift - certainly not being confident in how to Push was an issue - but the scene felt really unsatisfying, as did a later scene. I'm going to re-read the PDF before the con this weekend, as I feel I may have missed some stuff that would be relevant, but also if Ben could help me iron out any potential difficulties it would be greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317738/#Comment_317738" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T01:17:56+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  1:17AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Was the Chief thinking out loud (from the playing scenes section)?

Some are not immediately obvious when you first play Microscope, but as you get used to your player authority they become clear:<br/><br/>- You say things that imply agendas of the other character ("I knew all along he was a human supremacist!"). You can't force the other character to think that way, but you can give them options they can play along with.<br/><br/>- You can introduce other characters in varying degrees of influence over the situation. You say you did X, but we don't know why yet, I introduce your boss in the middle the scene (secondary character) and ask if you did that thing I wanted (double-check to see if the "you already knew that" rule applies). Or the ensign who swears he saw you pull the switch, and accuses you in front of the captain -- explain yourself! You can also introduce people that give obvious motives "I'm playing your wife, who left you because you were spineless and could never make command decisions." Is that what the character is really like? Maybe, but it's definitely what the ex-wife thinks.<br/><br/>- On the trickier end of the spectrum, you can Push to make that other character perceive something. You can even make them perceive something in the past (it's speaking truth, but Pushed on to another character). You can't control how they react to the information, but you can definitely interject someone giving them orders, telling them something, seeing something that should prompt them to action etc. This definitely falls in the "You Already Knew That" field, but that's fine, you're already Pushing.<br/><br/>Remember that even if the person thought they are responsible, that doesn't necessarily make it so. They just think it is. Everyone else still has a hand in, if it makes sense. The person playing the doctor thinks she killed the patient with a bad dosage, but another player slips in and introduces an assassin who really slipped a poison into the IV minutes earlier. The doctor thinks they killed the patient, but they didn't. The answer is only as obvious as everyone lets it be.<br/><br/>Generally I don't recommend being too clever or trying to complicate things insanely in scenes, but these methods should make it more clear that a single player can't grab absolute authority in a scene. The goal is not to make a surprising answer, it's to be in the moment, experience the characters and enjoy the scene.<br/><br/>But in the end, if a player were to just sit at the table and stare at you, and refuse to play, well all you can do is call the scene and move on. No harm in that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317883/#Comment_317883" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T15:24:25+00:00" title="March 26, 2011  3:24PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks so much for all the suggestions and help, Ben.
