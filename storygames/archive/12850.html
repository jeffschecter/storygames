Check it out:<br><br>In <b>spring</b> old campaigns end as annual school cycles break, causing disruptions in play routines as student-gamers find summer jobs or go home for the summer or other such things. It is a transitional period.<br/>In <b>summer</b> we play at conventions or one-shots with visiting friends. Also, short summer campaigns with incomplete or temporary crews. Usually gaming is less than through winter, as summer is short here and we have many other things to do. However, conventions and visitations from long lost friends are intense.<br/>In <b>autumn</b> we start new gaming projects. I started a harsh design/playtest cycle for Eleanor's Dream now, for example. We make plans for the winter months and form groups out of the people who will be with us for the coming months.<br/>In <b>winter</b> we do long-term campaigning and other deep gaming in stable groups. Everybody has routines of work, school or other matters around which a weekly schedule is built, a schedule that usually lasts until the spring with perhaps some small disruption around the Christmas holidays. As now is autumn and it's time to be making these plans for the winter, it's natural that I've floated my playtest program and some old school dungeoneering with the locals to see if we could get a stable weekly group going. It's a reasonable expectation that such a group would last until the spring disruptions, which would give us many months of good gaming.<br/><br/>I would not be surprised to find out that this seasonal rhythm is much the same in other places.<br/><br/>I'm also considering doing an online dungeoneering campaign in either Finnish or English. Still trying to decide if the game's going to be my own homebrew, Runeslayers, LotFP or Mazes &amp; Minotaurs, though.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289394/#Comment_289394" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T13:21:24+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  1:21PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That seems deserving of its own thread, Eero.

The prep was killing me, and D&amp;D isn't doing anything to support the character-driven, high-stakes, unpredictable game it's turned into. It was as much fun as ever, but very, very hard work. And if I tinkered with any more rules, the players were going to murder me. <br/><br/>So instead we're finally getting a chance to play some of the indie games I've been desperate to try. We're starting with a Warhammer 40K reskin of 3:16, called Astartes. The first session was lots of fun (posted about it elsewhere on Story Games). Next up will be Apocalypse World, and then - at last! - Sorceror (set in 16th century Prague). Hopefully some Burning Wheel, too. Along the way I'm keeping an eye open for any candidates to convert Ptolus over to. <br/><br/>Also squeezing in more playtests of Age of Steel, my game of single-session sword and sorcery adventures, with any players who don't run away fast enough. Going good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289396/#Comment_289396" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T13:38:01+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  1:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm playing in my second straight campaign of Apocalypse World in a row.  That's both more play (rather than GMing) and more play of the same game in a row than I've done at any time since I stopped playing Rifts and In Nomine when I went off to China in high school.  It's pretty awesome, I have to say, really getting the chance to dig in and explore a game throughly.  The only other game I've done that with recently was Mouse Guard, but that was broken up over a period of several months.<br/><br/>PAX is next weekend, so I'll probably throw down some random stuff there with whoever I can find.  There's a bunch of new stuff I want to try out or play more of, like Dread House and Blowback.<br/><br/>For the fall, I'm plotting away with plans for Game Chef 2010, which will probably take up my time for a while.  Otherwise, I'm thinking about turning the "fall of Atlantis" scenario we played at GoPlayNW into a mini-campaign for Mist Robed Gate; I definitely want to play more in that setting, which was amazing.  And I want to run Apocalypse World or my low-tech space fantasy hack Fingers on the Firmament sometime before Christmas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289398/#Comment_289398" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T13:46:16+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  1:46PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently playing an Annalise game which really hit it's stride last nite. Probably 2-3 more weeks in that, I think, and I hope we'll manage to keep the weekly thing up (I start school next week, so I'm the weak point).<br/><br/>Will is putting together some kind of multi-game-running madness, and I hope to be involved with that, probably on a bi-weekly basis. He's all "I'm gonna run games," and I'm happy to play stuff for awhile. <br/><br/>My gf and I have some friends that we play board games with roughly monthly, and that's always nice. I like boardgames a lot.<br/><br/>There's some playtesting of Keith's project/s in the near future as well.<br/><br/>We've starting talking about making plans for a JiffyCon Chicago, hopefully in November.

I just came home from the coffee shop where I prepped for this week's session, so I'm particularly jazzed about it at the moment. MCing Apocalypse World is making me realize that, while I still want to play a character in an AW game sometime, MCing is crazy fun, and I'm not MCing because I really want to play: There's nothing I'd rather be doing in this current game than MCing. Which is awesome. It's making me think that, after I play in this upcoming Burning Wheel game, I will probably want to GM that, too.<br/><br/>In Sept. sometime a different group and myself are going to start playing Burning Wheel: Burning Blackmoor, as partially inspired by Judd's FR BW game. We just did the Sword on Thursday, which was very fun and I think got us all jazzed about the upcoming campaign. After the Sword our GM threw down the old First Fantasy Campaign Blackmoor map, and we dreamed up a little bit of situation &amp; characters, to be further fleshed out in our character burning session. Yes!<br/><br/>Last Saturday I played Kagematsu with some friends and my wife (!) who's only ever played an rpg (breaking the ice twice) with me, and who previously had been iffy about playing a male. She took to playing the wayward, old, gruff ronin Kagematsu with heart, and it was a really great game. I think she liked playing with a bigger group, too. We'll see if we get to that one-on-one AW game that she sorta wants to play.<br/><br/>I played S/lay w/Me again two weeks ago. I keep loving this game, and keep wanted to play a "full" game of it.<br/><br/>hmm, think that's it. This is the most gaming I've ever done in my life by far (AW every two weeks, BW every two weeks, interspersed one-shots like S/lay &amp; Kagematsu) and I'm having immense amounts of fun. It's been a good year!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289435/#Comment_289435" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T15:51:44+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  3:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans,<br/><br/>I am honored that those BWFR threads inspired a game at your table.<br/><br/>Maps and situation, like peas and carrots, I tell ya.<br/><br/>Please do let me know how it goes.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289441/#Comment_289441" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T16:03:56+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  4:03PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that convention season is more or less over (although I've still got New York Comic Con later this year), I'm getting back into design and hope to run games with the group I've joined here in the Twin Cities.

Now it's all ready for layout, so my involvement with the "design/writing" scene is down to 10% of my gaming experience, from 80%. <br/><br/>And fuck, after talking with the folks from Las Vegas and how they roll (Jerry, etc), and thinking about how I consume too much media and want to be more social, I realize that it's time I start up a Friday Night gaming group. Or something. In a few weeks. We'll alternate between playing at my house and playing at a local coffee house.<br/><br/>But now I want to get into even more gaming. <br/><br/>My Wednesday group just finished a campaign of Tenra Bansho run by Mark C (after a great run of Fiasco). Then we played a one-shot of Smallville with guest star Eric Boyd. It convinced us that we want to play a long Smallville game. Also on deck is a long Dresden Files game, likely after Smallville. After that, we're going to do some Warhammer 3E, and maybe a few one-shots.<br/><br/>I want to play Freemarket, nWoD Vampire, Remember Tomorrow, and 4e Dark Sun. This is the reason I'm putting together a second weekly gaming night.<br/><br/>I also want to run some weekend one-shots, like Eoris, Wu Xing, Apocalypse World, Yuuyake Koyake, etc.<br/><br/>Then, when the Hellas books arrive (October?), I'll be running a weekend game of that for a few weeks. I might turn that into a longer campaign.<br/><br/>But mostly, I want to do more campaign-style gaming. That means more sessions. I think I have it in me to do it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289460/#Comment_289460" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T18:00:16+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  6:00PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2010 6:03PM by Hans_c-o.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>But mostly, I want to do more campaign-style gaming.

We're a group of supers that was the "South Metro 141" division of national organization called "Freedom Force" in their original universe that was packed with supers more powerful than us. Then we got thrown into an alternate earth where there are no supers - except us and the inevitable villains that came through the rift with us. Now we're <i>the</i> "Freedom Force"! <br/><br/>I'm playing an android teen that was invented by the Golden-Age-Reed-Richards of our world that died in our reality but is alive and a regular scientist in the new one. My character - Kid Sensation - was programmed to uphold 1950s superheroes values and to grow and learn as a regular, "All-American" teen. He's the captain of the football team and he's trying to woo a punk girl at school named Spike. As his Aspects have begun to suffer he's been on a date with Spike where she got shot by the villain's henchmen, was told to stop going to school and pretending to be human by his team and his "father" (who isn't comfortable with that moniker), turned to the writings of J.D. Salinger and tagged the exterior of his team's secret HQ with Spike, and won the football game while the field was under attack from the villain and his troops (without compromising his secret identity!). All of the PCs are interconnected; Spike is the daughter of another player's day-job-boss and my Kid Sensation's creator in our original world was killed by another PC's radiation problem while building his containment suit.<br/><br/>Playing with the alternate world trope while in the process creating both worlds through play (these are all new characters) has worked really well for us. I'm excited about the next session where I will almost certainly Devastate a couple of Aspects. "Spike, a girl I like" is my Strife Aspect and I'm doing my best to keep her safe so the villain can't win (he's already Devastated the other two PCs' Strife Aspects) and because I think this would be too early to Transform or Redeem their relationship. I think my character's relationship with his father-figure is going to take the most punishment and I can't wait to see how it changes. I'm torn between wanting to get to the climax and wanting to keep these great stories going - and that's a great place to be!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289501/#Comment_289501" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T22:45:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2010 10:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2010 10:46PM by Thor_O.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Bret mentioned, I'm running a Burning Wheel game for him, Alexander and Topi. It's set in a fantasy northern Italian village in the age of the condottieri. The village has been half asleep in a sort of fairy glamour for more than 100 years, but now it is beginning to rouse itself as a brutal condottieri has been made the signore of the town and its surrounding villas. His knights and men are bringing new thoughts, ideas and religions to a village tenuously clinging to the old ways. The player characters are villagers: Topi is the half-mad butcher, Alexander is the naive miller's son, and Bret is a laborer touched by the fae. It's been pretty awesome so far! It looks like we're going to miss the next three weeks due to scheduling difficulties. But then we'll pick up with Alexander's character about to challenge his step father, a former sergeant in the Signore's free company, to a duel; Bret's character set to journey deep into the mire with his terrifying spirit wolf companion in search of the lost throne of his people's ancestral tribe; and Topi's character slaving away in the old quarry, the punishment he and his bandit society accepted when they surrendered to the Signore's steward, a brutal and pitiless man.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Burning THAC0 BW game I play in is still going strong--four years running now. We have just replaced the Althing of Alfheim with our own candidate (long story), and the elves have thus agreed to march with us and the dwarves of Rockhome to war against the sinister necromancer who bears the Hand of Vecna. We're about to make a (hopefully) quick side jaunt to the deserts of Yalarum (or Deedslarum, as we've taken to calling it), which is suffering under a vampire plague unleashed by one of the necromancer's allies. If all goes as planned, we will stop the vampires and then find the necromancer and end the threat he represents forever.<br/><br/>The Thursday group is struggling to get its feet back after a hiatus this summer. We got our wires crossed this week and so we didn't manage to get it together for the Lamentations of the Flame Princess: Weird Fantasy Role-Playing game that I had prepared to run. Hopefully, we'll get our act together soon.

I'm currently playing in a D&amp;D 4e game that's <i>just</i> gotten started, although I'm <i>very</i> excited, both about finally getting to play a system that's been sitting on my bookshelf forever <i>and</i> about my character, who is both utterly generic in terms of mechanics <i>and</i> a blank slate, just sitting there waiting for me to scrawl some awesome all over it if I'm given half a chance.<br/><br/>I'm also DMing a D&amp;D 3.5 PbP game almost entirely as a favor to a random forum poster who expressed interest in trying PbP for the first time. Because it's PbP, the game is horribly, painfully slow -- we've been playing for about a month and have covered what I estimate to be approximately a single four-hour session of tabletop play, but everyone's still very much engaged in the fiction and I feel entirely confident that everyone will stick around until the end of the mini-adventure I had planned and at least <i>somewhat</i> confident that they'll stay on for a longer campaign. I'm already seeing an advantage to the slow PbP format in that I began this adventure with <i>maybe</i> a paragraph's worth of prep. Everything else I've been able to improvise while still keeping up a reasonable posting schedule. I'm thinking now, though, that even that paragraph was too much -- one of the players came up with a perfectly reasonable hypothesis about what was going on in the fiction that I would have <i>loved</i> to have come true, but unfortunately I couldn't come up with a way of making it fit with some things I'd already foreshadowed. I'm chalking that up as a learning experience -- I love GMing on the fly in tabletop games, but the much slower online format means I need to do even <i>less</i> "cover my ass" type planning ahead of time.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm playing in a <i>terrible</i> 3.5 PbP game with one of the least-skilled DMs I've ever had the misfortune of playing with. It's a clumsily railroaded, "passive-aggressively misunderstand the intent of every player's stated action" kind of affair that probably would have driven me to screaming fits in a live game. But because it's a slow-ass online game, I'm able to sigh, facepalm, and roll my eyes every time the DM says something stupid (i.e., every post) and then address the game for what it is -- a horribly written text adventure. In fact, for a brief while there I was <i>treating</i> it as a bad text adventure, phrasing all of my characters actions in the form of "GO NORTH. EXAMINE DOOR." But my snarkiness seemed to sail completely over the DM's head, so I've gone back to chewing the scenery with ridiculous overacting while waiting for the DM to tell us what happens next in his hackneyed, pre-written plot. In other words, perverse as it sounds, I'm having a blast. Unfortunately, at least half of the party isn't, as we haven't heard from them in several weeks, so I don't expect this game to last much longer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steven" title="Steven"><img alt="Steven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://sjhhanlon.wordpress.com/files/2007/10/tinyphoto.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steven">Steven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289535/#Comment_289535" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T02:28:44+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  2:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing quite a bit of Burning Wheel recently. We're doing a 'second season' returning to a game that we much loved, but petered out. I'm GMing so I'm working hard to bring in the insights I got from the Adventure Burner (apparently I was doing it all wrong before). We're having fun, but we still aren't quite getting all the rules. A lot of table time is spent with noses in the books, but I'm confident we'll get past that with effort.<br/><br/>We also played a session of Remember Tomorrow. A drug war between Triads, pharma collectives and a skinny, psycho white girl on a personal mission shook things up a bit. In the end we found that drugs had been re-criminalised, the undercover cop in the Triads had taken control for his own reasons and a crusading cop had been a serial killer all along. It was supposed to be a one-off but I think we'll be back. The game evokes the source material very vividly. <br/><br/>Also looking forward to Indiecon and Concrete Cow over the coming months.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289560/#Comment_289560" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T08:03:33+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  8:03AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My face-to-face game group is playing some one shots until mid-September when "Dude" runs a miniseries of Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/>When that raps, I will be running a Star Wars anthology game where we begin with a crew of a tramp freighter using WEG d6 then after a story, we switch game systems, then a story, then switch.

It's been the most satisfying and fun campaign I've played in since the year-long Exalted 1E Sidereal campaign Shreyas ran for me and some friends.. five? Six years ago? Next we're talking some Poison'd and maybe some Knife &amp; Candle. <br/><br/>Also, Shreyas is all excited about using Smallville to play teenage Camelot (inspired by the show Merlin), and I'm pretty psyched about getting some friends together for that. Then there's S/lay w/me, and then the Blowback games I've been running on Skype. It's been weird dropping into gaming groups that have been playing for a long time just to guest-GM, but a lot of fun, too.<br/><br/>Ideally I'd get to play some Fiasco and Freemarket, and more Apocalypse World too. And maybe someday I'll get to play Blowback. But I'm certainly not complaining about the state of things; fall is very gameful, and that's the way I like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289597/#Comment_289597" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T10:59:13+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 10:59AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2010 11:35AM by nemomeme.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in two Apocalypse World campaigns right now.  Turned over MC duties in one of them so I'm a player now in both.  Each game has a very different flavor and I'm really enjoying my characters in each.  As far as I'm concerned I might like to continue playing both campaigns until the end of the year but I suspect they'll each go for about five more sessions.  You never know how these things might pan out though.<br/><br/>I really dug MC'ing and feel like Apocalypse World is a game that lots of people I've gamed with would enjoy.  So I'm pitching it to some others and hoping to start up a third concurrent campaign in a month or so.  My eventual plan is for there to be seven concurrent Apocalypse World campaigns running in Portland, OR.  When that happens I will open my brain to the psychic maelstrom and there will come The New Beginning.<br/><br/>I've got Smallville on reserve at my FLGS and I've been reading a lot of threads on that.  One of my groups likes PTA a lot and I wonder whether we might like to give Smallville a try for some TV drama role-playing after we finish Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>If the third Apocalypse World campaign pitch falls through I expect more Danger Patrol playtesting and/or some Lamentations of the Flame Princess gaming is on the docket.<br/><br/>I've played S/Lay w/Me a couple times in the last month and would definitely like to play more of that.  Very good game for me.  I really want to know what's going to happen to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12805&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">S\xe6hr\xf3kr</a> next.  S/lay has made me want to read more from its source inspirations so that's going to cut into some of my gaming time. <br/><br/>Speaking of which there's something I wonder about Apocalypse World.  It really wants at LEAST six sessions and I'm feeling like ten or more sessions, maybe <i>much</i> more is really where it's at.  A game like this hasn't really hit this community before.  There was a period of about a year where I felt like there weren't all that many RPGs that were coming out that were really grabbing me.  More recently I feel like I could list several that I would like to play that have come out or are coming out soon.  But I personally am going to have to put a lot of them off in favor of long-form Apocalypse World.  In this way Apocalypse World feels a bit to me a little like World of Warcraft in 2005 where other PC game software developers were just putting stuff out into the howling face of a monolithic Blizzard...<br/><br/>edit: I'm personally only interested in the DFRPG for possible John Constantine hacking, but that's another giant horse out the gate in terms of time-commitment, wanting two sessions of campaign/character creation before you even get started <i>playing</i>, so people who start those games up will want to really dig into them for a long time to get everything they can from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289646/#Comment_289646" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T17:17:05+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  5:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gearing up to run the fourth <i>Unity Underground</i> playtest campaign for my Tuesday group and I'm over the moon about it.

I just haven't seen any of them as being as popular locally as Apocalypse World seems to be at the same time that a pile of great games are coming out.  Some people are like, "Let's just play this and hacks of it for the next year, people who are usually about one-shots and three-shots and the next flavor of the month.  I see it as possibly taking a bite out of opportunities for variety.<br/><br/>That observation may be premature and I may have overstated.  Let's just say I'm feeling scheduling pressures like never before despite having a lot more free time.

The prep was killing me, and D&amp;D isn't doing anything to support the character-driven, high-stakes, unpredictable game it's turned into. It was as much fun as ever, but very, very hard work. And if I tinkered with any more rules, the players were going to murder me.</blockquote>\nGod, I'd love to play in a Ptolus game, but I wouldn't want to run one. I am envious of your players but not of you! How long did it run? Have you considered rebooting it as a Burning Wheel game with a Ptolus-y setting? I know that's an odd idea, given that Ptolus' main conceit is that the D&amp;D world is real, but...<br/><br/><br/>My summer has been insane. Lost job, found new job. Picking up the slack around home so my wife can finish her book (historical fiction), due to Berkley very soon now. <br/><br/>Throughout, I've been trying to game. Because of the job situation, cons were right out. Nerdly got canceled; I missed DEXcon and GenCon. I struggled to get a group together to play my new Caldera setting (more in a minute) for D&amp;D 4E. You'd think it'd be easy to find people for 4E but it wasn't. <br/><br/>I also finished up a lot of editing this summer. Maybe some of it was late spring. I can't remember. But I did Happy Birthday, Robot!, Misspent Youth, and Annalise, plus picked up work on Other Worlds (which I'm very overdue on and need to remedy).<br/><br/>Daniel Levine is running an Apocalypse World game and it rocks. We're on our third session, fourth tomorrow night. I'm playing an Operator named Ebb, who is a hair's breadth from being a sociopath. I enjoy seeing him teeter on that edge as he does whatever he has to do to survive in his awful world. I'm hoping he can be redeemed, but we'll see what happens.<br/><br/>I finally got players for Caldera, which is my D&amp;D 4E setting colored with cyberpunk tropes. Millions of people squashed into a stacked, six-level city. Why? Because the senate won't let them leave because they figured out that magic is created by people's creative energy. Caldera has magical tattoos, residuum (magic powder) mines, a custom gargoyle race, castes, mirrorrunning, and monsters borne of the city's collective conscious. When you dungeon-crawl in Caldera, you're just down in the dark streets of the lower levels, and there are <i>people</i> there, trying to live their lives. Anyway, with the two players who could make it (and without two or three more who will eventually join), I kicked off an intro game last Thursday and it ROCKED. I'm looking forward to running that more.<br/><br/>In September, Daniel Levine is kicking off a Dark Sun game run as a "Western Marches" style campaign. That looks incredibly fun but I'll probably jump in only occasionally. My AW game and Caldera game both run every other week, so that's four games a month and that's all I can handle most of the time. Hell, barely that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289848/#Comment_289848" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T10:14:23+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 10:18AM by Daniel H..">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tonight begins a monthly foray into the Tomb of Horrors, 4th-Edition style.

<i>Amadeus</i> crashing into <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>.  So far, though, the scheduling has been a bitch; I suspect this group can't sustain a long-running campaign.  We may have to shift to more episodic play.  Though we're all invested in this game, a few are waxing nostalgic about the Exalted Dragon-Blooded game from a few years back.  I suspect it's easier for us to support that with our once-in-a-blue-moon meeting schedule.  Looks like we may jump back into that one for the winter, using either HQ or the PDQ port, picking up the moonlight-stained threads of Venale in the spring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis" title="Morten Greis"><img alt="Morten Greis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis">Morten Greis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290957/#Comment_290957" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T16:15:21+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  4:15PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am continuing my campaigns. Two of them have been running for a year now and two for several years.<br/><br/>The Wizard Campaign: D&amp;D 3,5 with heavy dosage of house rules. The characters are all students at The Great School of Magic in Glantri (Mystara-setting), when a huge war with the Alphatian Empire breaks out. The students have to deal with school, career, parental and societal expectations and the war ever looming in the horizon.<br/><br/>When we are unable to play the Wizard Campaign, we have the spare campaign: Voyage of the Sky Eagle. A D&amp;D 4th ed. campaign about the crew on board a flying ship on secret mission to ally the Thyatian Empire with the dragons against the Alphatian Empire (same war as above, the two campaigns play out roughly at the same time). The campaign is episodic in nature (a la Star Trek),a dn each player has three characters from which he chooses, when the mission is known and an away team is put together. A light amount of house rules support the game.<br/><br/>The third campaign is with a different group. We're running D&amp;D 4th ed with a light dash of house rules, and we are playing B10 Night's Dark Terror (publ. 1986). It takes place in the same setting and at the same time as the two others, but this time in the Grand Duchy of Karameikos, which is some of the remotest parts of the Thyatian Empire and the war is a very distant phenomenon. This campaign has been running for a year. Once we're finished the plan is to keep playing the old B and X series.<br/><br/>The fourth campaign is with yet another group. The campaign has lasted a year, and is a Delta Green-campaign. The rules are a mash of CoC and Unknown Armies and a heavy dosage of house rules. We're following the agents of Cell S and Cell T as they struggle to stay alive, stay sane and stay human against overwhelming odds. So far one has been murdered by his fellow agent and one had his brain stolen by Mi-go. In addition three NPC-agents were lost.<br/><br/>Hopefully I get the time to play a little more Trail of Cthulhu: Bookhounds of London - and various oneshots of games such as Annalise, Mouse Guard, Dirty Secrets, and whatever I might pick up at Spieltage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290964/#Comment_290964" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T16:46:13+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  4:46PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, I've gotta wait six months before I can join this thread and talk about my autumnal gaming experiences...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290973/#Comment_290973" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T17:56:31+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  5:56PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Morten Greis</cite>the spare campaign</blockquote>\nI picture a beat-up old box set in the trunk of an oldsmobile.

Kicking off an ongoing <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> game for the first time in many years.<br/>2. On the opposite pair of Tuesdays from CoC, continuing playing in a 4E game that has hit mid-heroic and is starting to seriously take off into more player-driven directions.<br/>3. Playing grungily Old-School <i>Castles &amp; Crusades</i> about one Sunday a month, where my drug-addled masochist of a dwarf is one of the more upstanding and shiny of the cast<br/>4. Planning a one-shot run of <i>Tomb of Horrors</i> (4E conversion of original module) for sometime in October with my old 4E group.<br/>5. Finishing up Season 2 of <i>D&amp;D Encounters</i>, and hopefully doing Season 3 with the whole family (including my 11-yr-old).<br/>6. Planting the seeds of some <i>Apocalypse World</i> for after we wrap CoC.<br/>7. Playing some <i>MAID RPG</i>, <i>It Was A Mutual Decision</i>, <i>Shab al-Hiri Roach</i>, and maybe <i>Geiger Counter</i> as one-shots when not everybody can make it to one of the other games.<br/>8.

Millions of people squashed into a stacked, six-level city. Why? Because the senate won't let them leave because they figured out that magic is created by people's creative energy. Caldera has magical tattoos, residuum (magic powder) mines, a custom gargoyle race, castes, mirrorrunning, and monsters borne of the city's collective conscious. When you dungeon-crawl in Caldera, you're just down in the dark streets of the lower levels, and there are<i>people</i>there, trying to live their lives. Anyway, with the two players who could make it (and without two or three more who will eventually join), I kicked off an intro game last Thursday and it ROCKED.

The guys should all hit paragon before the end of the year.<br/><br/>I was struggling with D&amp;D preparation as well.  My solution this time around goes like this: the party's going on a big overland journey quest right now, structured as a skill challenge through random obstacles and weather.  These are relatively easy to write and riff on.  I can insert sub/sidequests within the macro-quest to distract and confound the party, and then I decorate with tabletop minis goodness as appropriate.<br/><br/>D&amp;D demands that the DM prepare lots of encounters in order to properly deplete the party's resources and engage the game's economy and goodness.  When I started DMing, we had a lot of single-fight adventuring days, and that was lame, but fixing it with encounters for the sake of encounters was either grindy or really hard to prepare well.  <br/><br/>This time around, I'm going to try widening the scale of the adventuring day by putting a ticking clock on the macro-quest.  If the party pauses for an extended rest, they have to save or suffer a skill challenge failure in the macro quest.  That will hopefully make them carefully ponder their daily power usage and their willingness to charge off on tangents.<br/><br/>It'll suck when the warlord misses (again) on his Lead the Attack and has to wait eight sessions for it to recharge, but that's life in the infantry, man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12850/autumnal-gaming" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12850/autumnal-gaming" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12850/autumnal-gaming/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12850%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12850%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
