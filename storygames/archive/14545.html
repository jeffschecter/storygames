Maybe violence is the problem you are trying to solve. But violence can't solve the problem. It either fails or seemingly succeeds in the short term but makes the problem far worse in the future. <br/><br/><b>My second thought</b>\u2026 will GMs volunteer? Will players come?<br/><br/>But you lose and gain people no matter what you do. Last Recess was video game themed which meant we lost several older regular male gamers and gained many more female teenagers. I suspect this would be similar but on a much more massive scale. <br/><br/>We could add a charity element where we help raise money for victims of violence. <br/><br/><b>What do you think?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331337/#Comment_331337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T12:56:42+00:00" title="June 23, 2011 12:56PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am already very inspired.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331338/#Comment_331338" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T13:16:16+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  1:16PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depending on when you schedule this, I'd happily donate a copy of Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple to the event.

In those games, violence never really "solves" anything, necessary, but there's still a lot of violence in those games because 1) not all the characters are really that interested in solving problems, 2) solving problems is hard and attempts can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and violence, and 3) according to the premises of those games, violence is easy, readily available at hand, and assumed to be prevelant.<br/><br/>So what parts are you really suggesting be changed, for such a meetup?<br/><br/>-- Are all the PCs interested in solving problems rather than seeking their own interests or causing trouble for others (getting revenge, etc.)?<br/>-- Are the problems solvable without things getting really ugly? What happens when folks try to solve problems and it doesn't work out?<br/>-- Is violence really difficult, unavailable, or just assumed to not be prevelent in the game?<br/><br/>Finally, the other place where violence creeps in is <i>as a consequence for failing or otherwise messing things up</i>.  So, is failure not an option in such games or does failure just never lead to violence, however bad the failure?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331342/#Comment_331342" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T13:45:06+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  1:45PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thought: Wish I could be there.

That could just mean the shorter version won't be as powerful or pure, but that's ok.<br/><br/>But it is also true that you could play Apocalypse World for many sessions and leave your experience thinking "violence is awesome" or more likely "violence is awesome when the other side can't effectively fight back!"

So, I'd be totally down for this. And there are many other folks in that position. Really, I think you'd have a bumper crop of games/GMs etc.<br/><br/>The problem I see is the focus on controlling how violence shows up and plays out in games. Unless you're interested in adopting a Happy Ends-like policy where you issue whistles to the GMs and have them interrupt play with a loud tweet when the fiction starts heading that direction ("Time out! Back to your corners and come back with a retcon for how violence did <b>not</b> just save the day!"), it's unenforceable. But if you're instead looking to host a con where all of the games run are primarily not about violence and violent action, you'd have more takers, and you'd make your point.

I was vaguely thinking more in line with yourself and Joe. And less so in line with games that don't deal with violence at all.<br/><br/>But I could see both work really well. A larger event could take on multiple angles. Games that deal with non-violence in situation where violence may be considered an option AND games that have nothing to do with violence. I think both concepts would be a nice alternative to the average convention game (which isn't a criticism on convention games, just looking to do something different).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331380/#Comment_331380" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T15:50:40+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  3:50PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points Emily!<br/><br/>My initial rough thoughts (which could be completely wrong) was that you would let a game play out normally. Even if the conventions social contract was an attempt at non-violence, if players wanted to break from that, they could and they would be no mechanism to stop them, censor them, or retcon their actions. Instead, the game would end as normal and then in the epilogue you would see the future consequences of violence. But that was just one idea in how to deal with the 4 hour time constraint. Agree with Joe that a more natural progression that is revealed in play through multiple sessions is much more powerful. <br/><br/>One person had an idea that you could commit violence but every time you did you have to donate $5 to a charity helping the victims of violence. A little twisted! <br/><br/>I definitely don't think I have the perfect answer. Right now it's barely a seed in the ground. Plenty of room to grow and to shape that growth! <br/><br/>Outside of Story Games, several people responded to the idea with variations of "no one will come or want to play" and "how can you play RPGs without combat being the point". Which tells me, that this sort of event, whatever the details, could be useful. The visceral reaction that violence is the only way to play RPGs seem like a sacred cow that could use slaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331395/#Comment_331395" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T16:30:09+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  4:30PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps the idea of an epilogue could be developed into its own meta-mini-story-game for each game run?

The average PC, almost irrespective of genre, has a kill count that if they really existed would make them famous for centuries. The psychological impact of having killed tens, perhaps hundreds of people is hard to picture.<br/><br/>Violence is cool if it drives something else, if it means something. It's a sauce, but most games (including those I play and run) lather it on as if pouring ketchup through a firehose at everything from a hamburger to a sherry trifle.<br/><br/>Personally I'd like to see violence in rpgs slapped down, beaten up, sucker-punched, kicked in, blown to pieces, stabbed, slashed, bludgeoned, garrotted, nuked from orbit, shot in the head, buckwheated, hung, drawn and quartered. I'd happily see violence take a critical to location 12.<br/><br/>So yeah, great idea.

Violence in Fiasco isn't the answer.<br/><br/>Or, better stated, violence is an encouraged answer because failure is the ultimate goal in Fiasco. You advocate for your character while simultaneously enjoying their catastrophic failure.<br/><br/>At least that's how I understand it.<br/><br/>So playing Fiasco at a themed convention like this would be one of many angles to take on the theme. It's more of the "we're going to have some silly fun with the whole 'violence doesn't work out well' theme by having lots of violence but having it turn out bad" approach.<br/><br/>Other games might take an approach that focused on more serious consequences with less humor attached. <br/><br/>Still other games would focus on games where violence isn't part of the equation to begin with, like relationship games.<br/><br/>Many approaches to the theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331593/#Comment_331593" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T13:11:14+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  1:11PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very into this idea and will certainly run something if it occurs!<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_331629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331629/#Comment_331629" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T21:56:19+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  9:56PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good idea!

A strawman perhaps, but assuming everone has the same expectations on what is violent is going to lead to such confusions. Especially since notions of what is violent behavior and what is not will likely be part of a player's identity.</blockquote>\nFrustrating but also eye opening! It would be interesting to see people's different reactions. The initial game might be bumpy but it could lead to fantastic conversations afterwards. Also, so many gamers find social conflict to be controversial, it would be curious just to see how that would be handled.<br/><br/>This is also another good reason to also offer games that have no violent component at all as an easy alternative option.<br/><br/>Part of my point is more that you need to frame this discussion / ambiguity or you'll end up with problems. Spontanteous communication of different perspectives may happen or you might just have people thinking other people are stupid, crazy, or abusive. Indeed the later can easily occur with an attempt to discuss.<br/><br/>If individual games (even avowedly no violence games) don't clarify what they mean by violence or that this particular amiguity is to be explored (possibly to the deteriment of exploring the consequences of violence), you run the risk of different perspectives driving things apart.<br/><br/>Also bear in mind you get a very different conversation if you talk about what is peaceful versus what is violent. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331660/#Comment_331660" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T06:10:29+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  6:10AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans: <a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html" rel="nofollow">Power Kill</a>.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331672/#Comment_331672" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T07:54:27+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  7:54AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread so far!

I've advocated, designed and played non-violent games for over two decades now, and have met these kind of reactions all the way. But; a lot of players have given in to my persistent nagging, and participated in games without combat, and have then "seen the light". <br/><br/>Two comments I've had after such games: <br/>- <i>"This is THE best game I've had ever! And not a f***ing knife in it! WOW!!!"</i><br/>- <i>"This was beautiful! Can I hug you?"</i> (a frightening comment, yes, I know. LOL)<br/><br/>The way forward is through actual game-play! Show, don't tell!<br/><br/>Played <i>Fabula Sirkus</i> two days ago; not a single blow to anyone, but a lot of thrills all the way. It's an old classic of mine, set to my standard fantasy-world, but in this instance; a totally non-violent focus. Being a newbie circus-performer with a magical circus-act prone to go wrong (with flames a'roaring) is not  something to take easy as a player ... ;-)<br/><br/>There is SO MUCH TO DO, outside the narrow box of hitting each other with clubs in the head ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_331849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331849/#Comment_331849" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T08:05:04+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  8:05AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2011 8:05AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            double post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331851/#Comment_331851" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T08:26:09+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  8:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love this.

He convinced the party that they were basically devils from hell. So when they decided to kidnap a pair of them to find out some goblin stuff, I gave them a mother and daughter who didn't really fit the stereotype and had their own very sympathetic agenda. The paladin still wanted to slaughter them, but everyone else was like, "dude, really? They are just like us. Let's find a better way." Which was nice. Later on there were big fights as usual, but this scene provided a lot of difficult choices for them to make related to the role of violence in their character's lives. They badly compromised their worthy mission by sparing those two goblins, which made a pretty cool statement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331863/#Comment_331863" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T09:17:24+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  9:17AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I gave them a mother and daughter who didn't really fit the stereotype and had their own very sympathetic agenda</blockquote>\nThis kind of thing is why I think that an anti-violence con is better than a non-violence one.

He has been swinging foam larp swords at people since he was 4. <br/><br/>Surely any day now, he'll stop being a well adjusted, friendly, easily calmed 9-year-old honor student and transform into an axe murderer.<br/><br/>There's no way that all that time spent hitting people with safely padded weapons could do anything except nurture an inevitable rage and teach him that violence is an acceptable solution to his problems.<br/><br/>And now he's old enough that he's started playing Dragon Age. Surely all those blood splatters will warp his sense of reality.<br/><br/>(That being said, to be honest, after the first time I spent a long night playing GTA3, I did sort of feel the urge to drive other people off the road the next day while commuting to work.
