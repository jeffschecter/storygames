Given we were one person short, and that Sorceror takes a bit of prep, we decided to sit down with <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Joy_Division.php" rel="nofollow">Joy Division</a> for this session.<br/><br/>The short answer: it was a blast, but it took some work to make it playable.<br/><br/>First off, there's no guidelines given to the GM about how to set the Risk and Adaptability for the Menace.  We eventually figured out that the Risk doesn't really make the game any harder for the PC's, it just makes the game longer.  We suggest values of 6-10 for your first game.<br/><br/>Adaptability is what makes a Menace hard to beat, and we found that at 2 it was pretty easy though not an absolute sure thing.  Adaptability 3 made the game a bit more challenging; one PC lost three contacts in that battle.  We suggest setting adaptability at one more than the number of PC's most of the time.<br/><br/>After our first round we decided that there was no price for putting dice into Quarantine so we instituted a rule that said that Quarantine dice were not moved into Neutralize  dice until after the Neutralize dice were thrown; this means that any dice you put into Quarantine are out of play for a round.<br/><br/>The game's a lot more fun if you give people, places and things names, and use them in the course of play.  It's a lot easier to give an order for assassination if they're nameless nonentities.  Have scratch paper handy.<br/><br/>Favorite quote: "You just had someone killed because he <i>might </i>be working on a technology that <i>might </i>become dangerous at some point in the future... welcome to the ethics of Joy Division."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PoundFool" title="PoundFool"><img alt="PoundFool" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/93/buddyicons/78471072@N00.jpg?1156208500"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PoundFool">PoundFool</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62183/#Comment_62183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-26T14:49:25+00:00" title="March 26, 2007  2:49PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2007 2:50PM by PoundFool.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am surprised you didn't mention the dichotomy between the original document's tone of sci-fi horror (can you stop a potentially inescapable, all-consuming technology?) and our decent into slight .... camp, for lack of a better word, for which I was very largely to blame.  By camp, I mean the lack of seriousness along the lines of the Men In Black movies (and perhaps the comics, which I have never seen).<br/><br/>One of the interesting aspects of our play, and I think it doesn't apply just to my slightly loony scientist, was a tendancy to have characters behave not quite the way we thought when we wrote their sheets. This may be as much a function of the players, our playing styles, and our inexperience of what the game asks of its characters as anything else. Still, I thought it interesting that the survelience expert ended up ordering those hits while refusing to ever actually get his hands dirty, and my European asthete-inventor with a taste for strum und drang ended up cheerfully creating mess and mayhem. And musical pig/pigeon hybrids.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62210/#Comment_62210" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-26T21:38:53+00:00" title="March 26, 2007  9:38PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn if I don't think "Who gets to play Ian Curtis?" every time I see this game mentioned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62224/#Comment_62224" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T04:47:01+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  4:47AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may be that we just didn't have the time to make the emotional investment in the characters that tragedy requires.<br/><br/>Like when the promising music student had his hands crushed...
