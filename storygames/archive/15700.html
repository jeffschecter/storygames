Similarly the towns people need to be full of loathing and contempt for the PCs.

I would say the master is present and active in about 1/3 of all scenes.  I make sure the minions are constantly sent to do things.  Usually focusing on these points:<br/><br/>1) Something that is impossible for the minion to do because of his Less than Human.<br/>2) Something that the minion is extra qualified to do because of his More than Human but absolutely opposed to his own interests.<br/>3) Something that complicates the minion or another minion's Connections.<br/><br/>And then all of that is peppered with the Master constantly promising but then withholding or conditionally applying whatever the minion emotionally needs.  For example, I remember one PC was actually being ultra effective at serving the Master's demands.  So I made sure the Master attributed credit to just about any other minion other than him.<br/><br/>GMing My Life with Master is extremely proactive.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S. Just remembered another favorite tactic of mine as the Master.  Make sure success on Task A actually hinders the Master on Task B then blame the Minion for it.  For example, send the Minion off to kidnap the Mayor's daughter but then come up with a reason as to why the Mayor's daughter needs to NOT be kidnapped for another part of the Master's plan to work.  When the minion comes back with the kidnapped daughter get angry and ask them why they would do something so stupid?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan" title="Zachary_Donovan"><img alt="Zachary_Donovan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan">Zachary_Donovan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355971/#Comment_355971" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T16:54:40+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  4:54PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oooh.<br/><br/>That is awesome.<br/><br/>Okay, time to go play this game now all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356007/#Comment_356007" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T00:48:38+00:00" title="January 26, 2012 12:48AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2012 12:50AM by James_Mullen.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: Zachary Donovan[/cite]Okay, time to go play this game now all the time.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nGood choice: I'd do that but everyone else in my RPG group would hit me with big sticks. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
