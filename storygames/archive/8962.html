Normal mail is much much cheaper if available, which for one book should be."</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit, I've never before shipped anything internationally.  it's an area of mailing and distribution I've just never had the pleasure of having to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm hoping I can get some pointers from the more experienced designers and self-publishers on here.  How does one go about setting up the least-painless method for shipping internationally, and managing such shipping costs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198017/#Comment_198017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T08:30:51+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  8:30AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't ship "internationally", ship to predetermined zones. For example, we ship to the European Union, let IPR take care of American customers and count on the remaining audiences being a bit proactive themselves. Like, if you live in Thailand, you might want to email me and ask about the shipping costs. There are not enough roleplayers in Thailand for me to worry about them routinely.<br><br>The normal postal services work well enough here within EU, and the cost structures are not very complex. Thus we can offer the same postal expenses to anywhere in EU, which saves on bother. If the situation were more complex, I imagine that I'd let the customer sort himself when placing the order - give a menu for different shipping zones, set up the script to calculate the weight of the order, provide a shipping cost... not that difficult.<br><br>Also, the post office will give you a comprehensive rundown of the cost structure if you ask for it, so there's no reason to query them case-by-case. Just figure out the weight and size categories your normal shipments fit in, and you'll get a pretty good idea of the typical shipping costs you'll be dealing with.<br><br>Finally, if you want to be simple, you can set yourself up to ship "internationally" by looking at the most expensive of your probable target countries and setting everybody up to pay according to that rate. Even if you'll end up shipping some outlier orders to Antarctica that way, the cheaper target zones will balance that overall. This way you can offer one price to everybody, which simplifies things. Might be a good idea if you only have one product and thus will always be sending the one type of package.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
