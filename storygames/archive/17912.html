Apparently low barriers to entry in a trick-show context ("Attempt to entice a person who is barely interested enough to dedicate 15 minutes to it.") interest me.<br/><br/><i>Zombie Cinema</i> can be explained externally (that is, described how it works, why it's played, etc.) in 5 minutes. You could probably get character creation and the first scene in 20 minutes. I'm usually conservative and promise that a group where nobody's played the game might take about 30 minutes to get going, but it'll be much faster if you just ask the other players to follow your lead instead of explaining the rules in advance.<br/><br/>I returned to the theme with <i>Fables of Camelot</i>, which was originally intended for the convention environment. the design precis was to create a game that demonstrates the excellence of roleplaying in 15 minutes. Ultimately an entire adventure takes about 30 minutes, character creation included, but the game's intended to be demonstrative and compelling already in the half-way point.<br/><br/>Yet another game that occurs to me is <i>S/lay w/ Me</i> by Ron Edwards. It only takes 1-2 inductees at once, but it's possible to explain the game and get well into a first adventure in 15 minutes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405307/#Comment_405307" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-02T19:06:16+00:00" title="February  2, 2013  7:06PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be that kind of guy, but I would use my own <b>This Is Pulp</b>. It's really fast when it comes to setup - we started to play while another group was midway into character generation in <b>InSpectres</b> - it uses tropes from Indiana Jones and similar movies, and you can explain the rules while playing. It's actually the only game I found confident enough to play with my non-gamer buddies. It doesn't have character generation which normally takes time. It doesn't have tricky rules. You just draw some stuff on a map together and then begin to play.<br/><br/>You can find the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17608/this-is-pulp-the-structure-of-the-rulebook#Item_1" rel="nofollow">play structure here</a> and take a look at <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/doc/TiP_George_Miller_Jr.pdf" rel="nofollow">one of the available characters</a>. I would recommend to go one turn each on the map, and then play one act instead of three (the acts are pretty similar, so you wont be missing anything out). The game takes normally around 70 minutes to play, if you haven't played the game before. With just adding one thing each on the map and one act, it should take 20-25 minutes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405309/#Comment_405309" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-02T20:25:14+00:00" title="February  2, 2013  8:25PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2013 8:25PM by Felan.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Newbies to tabletop RPGs generally, or experienced D&amp;D (or whatever) players new to story-games as a genre?<br/><br/>For the former, just tell them who they are (you're a cop, you're a convict, for example), narrate a situation, and ask "What do you do?"

You started by asking what media they like. If you know the specific media they offer- like the specific movie or show- you can present them with a key scene from it in a similar manner.<br/>I think the example given was Game of Thrones, where Renly comes to Stark after the death of Robert.

That would definitely get me hooked if I liked police procedurals.  I wonder if it would be worthwhile for us to pool together ideas like that in multiple genres?  I know many players and GMs would be clever enough to pull out a similar say, space opera scenario, from the blue, but for those who can't, would such a database be useful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405345/#Comment_405345" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-03T15:40:08+00:00" title="February  3, 2013  3:40PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2013 3:40PM by Graham.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd take them through set-up for Fiasco. <br/><br/>On a wider note, this problem has been solved before.

It's a great, short little "story game", with minimal but very effective mechanics.<br/><br/>I think it would be quite easy to create a mini-game that uses a small handful of AW-style moves, and the fictional positioning necessary for each move. If you can position yourself to make the move, you get a 7-9, automatically. Include a way to get a better result (like a 10+), which includes sacrificing something. It's diceless and easy to understand for the person playing.<br/><br/>Murderous Ghosts is another good option, as it often plays out in 15-20 minutes. (Unfortunately, if the player is lucky in the card draws, it can take much longer. A modification to the rules might be needed to shorten play - like how many cards must be red or whatever.)<br/><br/>Games which use mechanics based on popular games (e.g. Poker) lower the barrier for entry, as well.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
