I certainly don't hate it and I love me some tolkienesque high-fantasy. But by the 90's I have to say that whenever we got together to play "D&amp;D" we basically played a home brew with AD&amp;D monsters and settings. We still called it D&amp;D, but it really wasn't.<br/><br/>That said, D&amp;D is fine. I really don't have much of a problem with D&amp;D but the games tend to be about things that don't interest me:<br/><br/>GM: "the captain of the guard is standing point blank with an drawn bow pointed at your unarmored chest."  (Here the game is supposed to be about being in jeopardy but...)<br/>Player: "Well, I have 162 hp and that arrow does d6 damage so I walk up and cut his head off, then pull the arrow out of my chest and laugh maniacly." (its about addition and subtraction)<br/><br/>GM: "You push aside the body of the dead orc and in the chest you find a glowing sword and as you pull it from the chest you see the torchlight reflect off of it in an iridescent sheen which takes the shape of a serpent traveling up the razor sharp blade." (here the game is trying to be about mystery and magic, but...)<br/>Player: "Oh, just a +2 sword of holy flame. I've got a +3 sword of holy flame already and that one has a triple crit range. Anyone want a magic sword?" (It's about loot).<br/><br/>GM: "You stand before the doors of the Temple of Badassery, the doors are 50 feet high and the corridor extends beyond them into the inky darkness." (So, here the game is about adventuring into unknown dangers, but)<br/>Player: "We can't go in there. We don't have a cleric. We head back to town and see if we can find a cleric, or maybe a bard at least. Also, anyone have any rogue abilities. There may be traps in there. (now its about, what would you call this? Complete lameness. In what other narrative form do we see this shit?)<br/><br/>GM: "You are at the end of a 60' corridor. Its 10x10 and ..." (the game is about going down a corridor)<br/>Player: "I check for traps every ten feet as we walk"<br/>Other player: "I'm casting detect traps, detect evil, detect magic. Anything?"

I like games where choices matter, where there's jeopardy, where the setting is mysterious and magical (i.e. charged with emotion, not to be taken literally), and where there is adventure and sacrifice, triumphs and defeats of all types.

Thief skills are a good example - they worked nothing like Non-Weapon Proficiencies (i.e. skills), which also felt tacked-on.</li></ul>\nAlso, characters were "locked in" in a good number of ways - you always evolved along a fixed path, without significant ability to change as the game went on. The addition of kits and variant classes changed this, but as the game went on there were bigger and bigger balance problems associated with these - characters who could use Fireball at 1st level, or Disintegrate at 3rd.<br/><br/>Some elements came across as pretty arbitrary, like demihuman level limits. Most people ignored those.<br/><br/>So no, it's not <i>just</i> chic to hate D&amp;D, nor is it merely a large-numbers thing. Those things may <i>also</i> be true, but there were quite a few things that improved in the change to 3rd edition. I still remember loving 2nd edition; exposure to other games hasn't changed that. But it did make me realize that things could be done better.<br/><br/>No doubt the settings were very cool in general, and I wish that there were some better-quality adaptations of them to 3.n edition - the ones I've seen come out a little flat. But mechanically, 3rd edition was a great improvement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76148/#Comment_76148" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T19:47:06+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  7:47PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2007 9:31PM by E.T.Smith.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was such a AD&amp;D hater in my day. Really ridiculous, frothing at the mouth hatred, as in telling AD&amp;D players, no matter how much fun they were obviously having that they're game was *awful* and sardonically laughing off any offer to lower myself to their company, lest I waste my time on such trash. How I regret that behavior, 'cause it made me miss out on a lot of potential fun. I was the guy sitting by myself on club nights, scribbling notes about the cool obscure campaign I'd never get anyone to play while three boisterous AD&amp;D games were going on around me. Oh, mispsent youth.<br/><br/>Still, I'm certainly not going out of my way to look up AD&amp;D groups now, and I think the game suffered some noteworthy drawbacks. And though all the design quirks Colin_Fredericks point out are true, I think they're secondary to the following issues.<br/><br/>First and foremost (and what my personal bugaboo was that drove me to such extremes) was that AD&amp;D was the undisputed big dog. Not just popular, but the standard that defined the hobby; to most people, role-playing and AD&amp;D were synonymous. If you had any desire to do something not covered by AD&amp;D, it could grate vicously to be stuck with it. Compounding the dissatisfaction was the fact that if you had any sort of design awareness it was clear that AD&amp;D enjoyed first place for no better reason than sheer inertia. There were several games, even in just the fantasy genre, that were objectively better designed than AD&amp;D, yet its primacy remained untouched.<br/><br/>Many of those designs were better because, in my opinion, they had a focus that AD&amp;D didn't. The game was an uneven mix of its handlers interests, mixing concepts, systems and goals into a murky stew, leaving you to scoop in blind and hope you got what you were looking for. On one hand this this could be good, because it let folks play around with the mix, moving from element to element as they chose. But more often, those elements would clash horribly, something that became more pronounced as TSR tried to bring the game into directions it really wasn't capable of going. To quote an example I've often used, "this campaign will be about the rivalry between several suitors to romantically win the affections of the Princess. She has Six Hit Dice." By trying to be all things to all users, it ended up doing none of them well.<br/><br/>I mention TSR's handling of the game, and that deserves further attention. The later years of AD&amp;D had the dubious honor of witnessing the corporate inanity of TSR, and some odd actions were inflicted on the line, mainly in the form of crappy supplements and adventures.<br/><br/>The last thing that comes to my mind was that, even in the early 90's, AD&amp;D was a noticeably old design. It had clear and strong roots in the wargaming hobby. Which in and of itself is not a bad thing, but those years also represented the appearance of the first story-games. Anyone to whom the newer style games appealed, for whom games like "Over the Edge" or "Everway" did things they'd never been able to do before, looking back to AD&amp;D's hoary old sand-table thinking must have been like contemplating a return to Detroit after vacationing in Hawaii.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76153/#Comment_76153" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T20:58:34+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  8:58PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played AD&amp;D 2E from just about when it came out, for the next 5 years of my life pretty much every week, or every other week. It was like my Favorite Thing to Look Forward to in my high school days (until I got a girlfriend, then it was "Gaming and Girlfriend").<br/><br/>I think JD has the root of the issue (aside from the obvious great fixes of 3E which basically pointed out the depth of the flaws of 2e).<br/><br/>Frex, I loved kits. LOVED them. I dug most of the "Complete CLASS Handbook", especially the Thieves' one, which inspired a year's thief-only campaign. Kits were slick, because they gave you cool little bonuses as a character concept, without having to worry about how they affected your abilities at 4th, 8th, and 12th levels (like in 3E).<br/><br/>I LOVED Al Qadim, Dark Sun, and Planescape. In fact, I'm thinking about rebuying Al Qadim and running it with TSOY (but making it far more "real middle eastern").<br/><br/>Thaco was weird, the skills were silly, and the saving throws were clunky, but that game provided me some of the best times of my high school years that didn't involve kissing.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76155/#Comment_76155" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T21:08:20+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  9:08PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Al Qadim is just raw greatness served raw.

Why don't you use the bonuses only as attributes? And I still don't get the combat rules. I get always stuck at the squeezing rule. (How ironic.)<br/><br/>The other thing is: I like the idea that monsters/NPCs have different stats than PCs. It signals that the combat values of PCs aren't there to kill each other. thac0 means: this good you are in killing monsters, and it doesn't incorporate any killing other PCs. Because in reality a PC is something completely different then an NPC or a monster. The latter is just a tool of the GM, the former is part of The Party.<br/><br/>But it's really true that AD&amp;D had many illogical things. I still don't know whether I should roll high or low. And it made no sense at all, because (and this is the most irritating) <i>mechanically it's not different</i>. It's just messing with the math of the player.<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76180/#Comment_76180" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T05:26:23+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  5:26AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the squeezing rule?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76185/#Comment_76185" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T06:28:10+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  6:28AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>For example you don't use your attributes at all.

Even when I was a kid the rules seemed so arbitrary, rigid and shoved together to fill the various holes. I remember reading about the demihuman level caps and just getting irritated. An elf could live for a thousand plus years and still never be able to be a higher level fighter than a human? Wha? If you, with a random roll of the dice, get a high attribute you get an experience bonus for that one roll, while your buddy who rolled poorly gets dick all. Shit like that just drove me nuts. Sure, you could mess about with house rules, but the spirit of the rules seemed to be for restrictions and against fun. It was designed to be a lot more about the DM saying 'no' than 'yes'.<br/><br/>I think 3rd edition is a huge, huge improvement over 2nd edition. This isn't to say it's not flawed, because it is, and it wears me out, but hey, you can actually play a level 23 Dwarven fighter/bard/necromancer who can use a bastard sword, without having to alter any official rules.

In 1st ed, you had a chart that cross-referenced your level with target's armor class to figure out your To-hit roll.<br/><br/>Then, some smart monkey figured out that you could just subtract the AC from your To-Hit AC Zero and do the same thing, minus the chart. So your fighter Has THACO 20, subtract an AC ( say AC 9 for a peasant). Congrats, you need an 11 or better on d20 to hit. No chart reference needed.<br/><br/>Edit: After I posted this, I realized why I thought well of THACO: It was an aid primarily to GMs, rather than players. Having the THACO in a critter's statline (especially in modules) meant not having to reference the chart in the DMG during play. My players commonly had a single line somewhere on their character sheets with their To-Hit by AC already written in, so they'd be referencing that during play, rather than doing math or using the DMG's charts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76533/#Comment_76533" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T16:47:10+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  4:47PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2007 4:48PM by Arminius.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albert A</cite>What did AD&amp;D 1E have to fulfill the same role?</blockquote>A set of tables, one for each class basically, with target's AC along one side, and the level of the attacker along the top. You would cross index these to find the number you needed to equal or exceed in order to hit.<br/><br/>This was basically the same as in original (white/brown box) D&amp;D and the later Basic etc. boxed sets. However, in AD&amp;D (not sure about the others), the "20" was repeated on a number of lines of each column, so that it didn't become <i>impossible</i> to hit a target with a low AC quite as fast as it would if you just used a THAC0 system. (Or so I'd imagine, having never used THAC0 myself.)<br/><br/>Although it was kind of messy, it didn't seem all that bad if you were used to CRTs (combat results tables) from wargames.<br/><br/>Edit: cross-posted--but kept because of that funky detail about the repeated 20s.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76545/#Comment_76545" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T19:08:23+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  7:08PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2007 7:09PM by noclue.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Funny, I thought THACO was an improvement at the time...</blockquote>\nIt was.

The design decisions that went into AD&amp;D2 were based not so much on building a game that was fun to play, but on revising, re-presenting, and collating all the accumulated rules for AD&amp;D from all the sourcebooks and Dragon magazine articles, as well as influenced by questionable marketing decisions under Lorraine "I hate roleplaying games" Williams such as avoiding the 1980s "Satanic panic" and cross-selling settings to try to get you to use everything as one giant campaign setting. AD&amp;D rules have this law-like quality, where every published bit is enshrined for precedent and must be carried forward for sake of precedent, or explicitly amended. It became a positively baroque collection of little systems added on here and there, without regard for the larger affect these systems might have on gameplay. The usual answer for "Why is this rule here?" was usually "Because it appeared in a previous publication."<br/><br/>While the settings were certainly cool and lavishly illustrated (as could be expected from a company with such a pool of house writers and artists to draw on), they didn't always live up to their potential when actually played without applying a generous amount of GM-ooph. Most of the published adventures for this system are railroad central. Mainly, the game was written by people who were talented at creative writing, with talent for actual game design being unimportant. (This was, of course, part of a larger trend endemic to the "industry" of selling substandard fiction by dressing it up in a "game" presentation.) The mechanics in the various setting supplements always seem (and by marketing necessity, <i>are</i>) just "tacked on" as an afterthought.<br/><br/>I know a number of gamers who still think AD&amp;D2 is just fine, and without exception they wholeheartedly subscribe to the notion that system does not matter, that GM-ability is the defining conceit for RPGs. Those of us who actually appreciate good game design and see system as a thing that can and should be textually communicated just bristle at such at attitude.<br/><br/>Also, TSR was a notoriously bad "citizen" of the RPG publishing community, actively suing any third party who published material "for use with Dungeons &amp; Dragons." I believe this litigiousness is largely responsible for the rash of fantasy heartbreakers, all "filing the serial numbers off" of AD&amp;D in various ways, every company developing a more-or-less derivative "house system" like so many competing legal fiefs.<br/><br/>Combine this with frustration at the bandwagon heuristic ("If so many people are buying it, it <i>must</i> be the best game system.") and you get a lot of resentment for a game that continued to dominate the hobby during its time. A whole lot of smaller publishers put in a lot of work developing rulebooks to compete with that clunker, only to find that system innovation was basically unrewarded by the market.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76767/#Comment_76767" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T05:59:55+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  5:59AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me it is a mechanical consistancy issue.

The cheesy art, lack of much different from 1e, and the censoring just turned me off completely. And, at the time, Rolemaster and HERO 4th did everything so much better for me and my friends.

JDCorley</cite>Well, there's a reason that "system doesn't matter" and GM power lasted so long - because it works really well for a lot of groups in a lot of contexts.</blockquote>\nOne could argue that such loose GM'ing, when successful, is really just the result of the group knowing their drives and interests so well that they've started to satisfy them automatically without the need for rules support, having gone "beyond" system as it were. Or maybe they're just happy to meet for chips and beer. Whichever.\n<blockquote>The settings produced for AD&amp;D2 are actually pretty fucking cool no matter what you like.</blockquote>\nMeh. A couple of the AD&amp;D2 settings are indeed evocative (<i>Darksun, Planescape</i>) but just as many are merely mediocre (<i>Greyhawk</i>, despite its venerable pedigree) and a couple, I feel, are really flawed (<i>Ravenloft</i>). The good ones are good in spite of the system they are attached, not because of it, and the bad ones are failures because they accent the system's shortcomings. I felt there was only one really good match of system and setting when it came to AD&amp;D, and that was, suprisinlgy <i>Dragonlance</i> (at least the main DL hardback setting guide, not the railroady adventures). I think that's largely because DL explicitly wrote many of the quirks of the game into the world background, and gave a campaign story that gave a damn good reason for characters to quest in ruins for magical artifacts and level up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77037/#Comment_77037" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T23:35:42+00:00" title="June 21, 2007 11:35PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, ain't a one of them good because of the system.
