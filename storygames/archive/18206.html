This is my first AW (hack) campaign ever.<br/><br/>The players initially voted for something definitely asian so I prepared for a medieval chinese hardholding campaign (imagine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Margin" rel="nofollow">Water Margin</a>) but then the players liked one of my old sideproject which I mentioned so it turned out to be something completely different and crazy. Finally! I can mix my beloved ideas and themes such as postcolonialism, South East Asia, archaic and modern culture clashing, weird science fiction, 80's nostalgia ect... with a lot of cultural reference and irony ! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Most of the things were invented on the fly.<br/><br/>I've got the idea to use three original paramilitary class (crazy, juicer, psy stalker) from RIFTS as playbooks and tweak them. They represented three stage of the Other's experiment with humanity on their Great Leap Foward civilizatoric project.<br/>* The first PC is a chiptuned spy who represented the first cyberistic stage. It was established that after the Others disappeared (?), he worked for the mysterious Politburo (?) but he was cast to mental hospital. After the civil war broke out and anarchy gained ground (?) he somehow escaped and became a sleeper agent till he got the SIGN: The Politburo is still operanting and they need his service to assasinate a VIP!<br/>* The second PC was a sentenced to death for murder (?) but got an escape route thru joining an experiment which made him a chemically boosted killing machine. Since the civil war he works as a soldier of fortune, so the Spy could easily hire him.<br/>* The third PC is a biologically engineered animal-human hybrid, created by the Others to hunt down the "zombies" (?). It was immediately established that the spy's target is the "Zombie king" (?) who is hiding in the jungle while gathering strenght (?) so their ultimate goal actually concurred.<br/>* The fourth PC is a "half elf", a lovechild of an Other. Hating his cool psychic powers (?) and alien heritage, he quickly became a counter-revolutionist political agitator and later terrorist who was actually responsible for a mass destructive assault (?) against the New Order. Because he blames the Others for the zombies, and sees the zombs as their last 'legacy' it's nice to know him in the team.<br/><br/>Long story short they are very-very badass antiheroes on a suicide mission... tadam: the Z-TEAM <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I used the basic stats (adds to +3), basic crap and basic moves changing 'Open your Brain' to 'When you think about the Contact (and how it changed everything you know)'. Then they choose two (then later one more) fitting moves from AW playbooks and hacks.<br/><br/>We had two occasion to play and I made a lot of 'mistakes' (I guess old gaming habits) but for me it was a blast. You know... the typical first AW experience <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The players are also very much enjoying it although I consider them to be even more trad gamers than me.<br/><br/>I think the original MC things works pretty well but if you want, <b>you can help me with suggesting fitting MC principles, moves, etc!!!</b><br/>If you need more information for the feel, just think<br/>* Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes<br/>* Apocalypse Now<br/>* Predator<br/>AND<br/>* Picnic on the Roadside<br/>* Druuna<br/>* Beat'em ups <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>M\xe1ty\xe1s<br/><br/>(Sry, English is not my native language)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410892/#Comment_410892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T19:54:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  7:54PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds crazy and awesome!

It was established that zombies are spreading fast and then the PCs tried to go to its root. Going thru reaved lands and searching for zombies essentially killed my original premise and I couldnt accept it I guess. Game became bored as they explored more and more abandoned ruins and nothing really interesting happened. I think it was mainly because I could not forget my old habits of GMing. I should definitely try harder to follow the agendas and principles of *World.<br/><br/>Current situation: They are in the middle of the jungle with nearly no ammunition and a lot of zombie. They are all injured, some of them seriously. They searching for the old forgotten capital which might be the secret lair of the Zombie king. I dont want to see them going down and failing boringly when it's mainly my fault so I figured I would give them the chance to win. I think I'm going to start the next (and maybe final) episode with them <i>actually finding</i> the old capital and then retrospectively figuring out how they improved their chances, how they made it, and what mess did occur.<br/><br/>Will this work? What do you think? Do you have any advise?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419067/#Comment_419067" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-26T06:08:22+00:00" title="July 26, 2013  6:08AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it sounds like the obvious solid approach to your situation.

I used time pass extensively and the campaign closing turned out to be awesome!<br/><br/>Short summary (sry for my English, have no time)<br/>* We started the session establishing retroactively how the characters could find the lost capital and the secret base of the zombie king. The players seemed to enjoy this idea.<br/>* They were assuming a heroic suicide confrontation but I secretely prayed for a more open bang type of situation. Fortunately the characters decided to go into a rave and licked the back of a hallucinogenic toad and of course all botched their "open your brain" roll, so I could establish that the demagogue player lead them on a surreal spiritual journey. The time they regained counsciousness they were standing in front of the zombie king in the top of an angkorian temple surrounded with the masses of zombies. Instead of fighting they started to argue and realized that the zombies are not clearly the bad people etc. They mainly bite and spread and only kill their own kind if the newborn is going crazy. Maybe they DO represent the natural next step of evolution which the Others tried so meticulously to archieve with humans. Maybe the Others left because they realized that their job was done by Earth itself. The king admitted that he is not 100% sure in these but nonetheless he considered himself to be the incarnation of Rama, the great Uniter. But his vision of the unified zombie utopia sounded idealistic and fake. So at the end the characters simply beheaded the zombie king and succesfully convinced the zombie mass that everybody should go home peacefully :O<br/>* One week later: The characters were travelling to Contact Point and I wanted to introduce a crazy car-chase scene. But they shoot out the tires quite fast... so and of story... wow, great!<br/>* One year later: The world is changing fast. The hibrid charater was interested in making an antiserum for the zombie virus. The chiptunes spy became aware of the outer world and he wanted to travel. The juicer succesfully quited the combat drugs  and became a sad alcoholic. The "half elf" established a hermitage. For epilogue they all narrated an ending scene for their character similar to Fiasco. They enjoyed this technique quite much... THE END.<br/>* Maybe someday we will play one more adventure in The Expendables style!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
