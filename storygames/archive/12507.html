If PCs have multiple Bad Habits, then players must be supported and encouraged to make them as diverse as possible; use your BHs to showcase different, even contradictory aspects of the character. If two or more of a character's BHs occupy the same thematic ground, then opportunities for earning Survival points are reduced, but it is a very easy trap to fall into; for example, 'Quick Tempered' and 'Hates women' are both demonstrations of how the character doesn't get on well with others, so that PC is likely to face situations where both conditions could apply. If they had used one of those BHs to show a different side of their character, they would have doubled the number of situations where it was possible for them to earn a Survival point.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. A campaign works perfectly well using only the rules from the 2nd Edition book; gaining 2 Survival points for surviving to the next session is enough to keep the mortality rate to an acceptable level and preserves continuity. The additional rule module I plugged in, Baggage, wasn't a neccessity, but it was helpful in enabling players to hold onto their characters a little bit longer than they otherwise would have.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. On the subject of Baggage, we found two ways in which it worked most effectively: first, when the Baggage represented something physical that the PC lugged around with them, such as a valued possession or a loved one. In this form, the Baggage fitted well with the mechanics that allowed you to roll 3d10 instead of 2d10 when the Baggage was relevant to the task, e.g. firing your Grandfather's antique pistol at the monsters or saving your best friend from danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, when the Baggage represented a goal or ideal, something that was hugely important to the character's life, e.g. travelling to a particular destination or winning a target's affection. This gives players much more of an incentive to go off the rails and gives the GM more ammuntion to use in making the PCs lives more complicated. The very best kind of Baggage is something that has elements of both of these, such as where you want to change the relationship you have to an NPC in your care or you have to deliver an item in undamaged condition to its intended recipient. Given these considerations, I'd change the name of Baggage to 'Reasons to Live', as that better reflects what they should be about.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Every PC should start out with some kind of agenda that is separate from the main plot of the campaign but which allows for them to interfere with each other. This can either be in the form of a Reason to Live, as outlined above, or just a statement by the player making it clear what their character wants and how far they will go to achieve it. In order to keep a campaign varied, you need to give the PCs challenges besides the simple facts of survival and its much easier to do so if the PCs clearly want things that they are prepared to fight for. This also helps in keeping the intra-party relationships on the simmer and provides a source of further conflicts between PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. As GM, you don't have to sit and wait for players to claim Survival points for acting out their Bad Habits, you can offer them a point and suggest what their character could do right now. This is very similar to the way in which Spirit of the Century uses aspects &amp; compels, bribing a player with game resources in order to bring in some disadvantageous narrative thread focussed on their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
