What's <i>Death's Door</i>?<br/><br/>For a little while now, I've been thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_armor" rel="nofollow">plot armor</a> as a game mechanic, specifically as a pacing mechanic.  Characters have a numeric value which represents your plot armor, and when they run out of it, they die.  When you get into a conflict, you can use points from your character's plot armor pool to give you more of an advantage in winning a conflict, but the more points you use the closer your character is to having no more plot armor.  At the Dreamation Indie Roundtable, Ry brought up the idea of a choose-your-own-adventure / questionnaire for character creation (similar to that of Dread).  This got me thinking about how interesting it might be for a character to sort of be tangentially aware of their plot armor.  With that said, I came up with a couple questions for such a game.  I was discussing them last night with Rachel, and she suggested I post them here.<br/><br/>I was curious to see what peoples' reactions would be, but so far no one's biting.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259157/#Comment_259157" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T23:10:46+00:00" title="February 28, 2010 11:10PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2010 11:11PM by nikodemus.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've been thinking about plot armor as a game mechanic</blockquote>\nFor <i>years</i> now I've been thinking about running a freeform game where characters have a single stat, Fate.

I mean, seriously, it'd take an English playwright to work in some technicality about C-section... As if *that* is going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Knowing that you will die soon, what do you regret the most? Also, of what are you most proud?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now that my ex-best friend told me he was ripped untimely from his mother's womb (even if we weren't already ex-bffs, we would be now; You don't keep secrets from bffs!) I'm pretty regretful about the whole having his son killed thing. I'm pretty proud of all the shit I did before the play started, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so that was only a semi-serious answer.
