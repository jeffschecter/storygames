Many of which I would have never expected to be so emotional. The game was like jeepform\u2026 but less intense (which made it more emotional). For example, one technique he used was boredom! There were long stretches of the game that were "boring" from a modern movie perspective. </blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>I've seen tears stream in 5 (I think) Ribbon Drive games so far.<br/><br/>It's emotionally provoking in a few ways: (1) it pushes towards real drama over big drama. Sometimes that makes for stories that echo hard experiences we've had. (2) There's lots of moments of "boring," just like the game that Jenskot's OP describes. Having lulls in the action allow you to just connect with your character, and hear their thoughts. (3) The game is very immersive, and the mechanics are very light and require very little handling time. There's nothing mediating conversations. (4) The game isn't about succeeding at a task; it's about exploring an outlook. When you aren't getting swept away by the success/failure paradigm, you have more energy to put towards empathizing and resonanting.</blockquote>\nThis sounds like really great stuff John and Joe! <br/><br/>I'd like to learn more about how you design and GM towards 'boredom' as a means of characterization, immersion and exploration. I'm not really interested in making people cry per se, rather designing and GMing towards that level of immersion. Particularly best practices for intense 'action-less' character driven parts as a means to explore character, theme and setting.<br/><br/>I want the nitty-gritty how-to so please abstain from theory-crafting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
