My problem is that this happened:<br/><br/>- After a conflict the player rolls the fall-out dice (all d4s).<br/>- The player sometimes gets long-term fall-out.<br/>- I ask the player to choose from the list.<br/>- The player always chooses 1d4 trait or +1d4 on any d4 trait.<br/>- At the next conflict the player always "takes the blow" with these d4 traits and gets many-many d4 fall-out dice.<br/>- The conflict doesn't esacalate, because the many d4 traits are enough to save the high rolls for raises.<br/>- The player gets even more d4 fall-out dice, wich generates even more probably d4 traits.<br/>- Perpetuum Mobile.<br/><br/>Okay, I understand that this is a "hippy story-game", but I think it's too much to expect the players to choose -1d6 stat instead of +1d4 trait if the above cycle works. Why should (s)he?<br/>Am I doing something wrong? Should I choose the fall-out result instead of the players? Should I be more restrictive when accepting the usage of traits to make them hard to use the d4 traits? But that would defeat the purpost that d4s are causing problems.<br/><br/>For now I'm planning that next time I'm choosing the fall-out for the players, most probably by rolling a die or two to be fair.<br/><br/>I'd appreciate any helpful input.

For some, choosing one of those options is a form of expression (trumping the need for optimal choices); I'm the sort of player who may pick a -1d6 because I like what that represents to me.<br/><br/>But, the last long-term game I played, most people given the choice would pick the +1d4. I wasn't fine with that at first; eventually I was.<br/><br/>There is the theory that continual d4 traits around is a self-balancing thing, i.e. that rolled d4's have low value and are likely only used for the character to "take the blow", i.e. cede fictional stakes and stay in conflicts longer than they should, which will create problems if they're responding to raises that are more than just talking. I'm not sure that all players are convinced by this logic; in some sense, having those extra dice around can't hurt.<br/><br/>So on one hand, harder raises (either because they are escalated, or because they have heavier fictional content) will disuade players from taking the blow. Meanwhile, you can either be comfortable with players taking the +1d4 fallout, or you can hack the game to change the options. (If you want fallout to always have some negative connotation, you could have players take a negative fallout trait, and take on a +1d4 trait if they want though I think many Dogs players would disagree with such a hack. Like any hacks, use only as directed, YMMV, IMO, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196206/#Comment_196206" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T19:34:26+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  7:34PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2009 7:37PM by algi.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Crossposted.)<br/><br/>Thanks for your input.<br/><br/>So as I understand you give the advice to escalate instead of the players. But I thought that this game is about how the players handle the conflicts. Of course with time the problems are getting worse (escalating <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> in the town and brings the conflict to the players. But as I understand, the players should decide how they handle the problems. I mean of course where it has sense to escalate, I do, but most of NPCs just want to do their own thing and want the Dogs to sanction their thing. If I would start to bring the conflicts to the PCs and decide in which arena are they fought, that would mean that I came up with a "story", an "adventure" which is completely the opposite of why I would like to play Dogs.<br/><br/>The other thing is: If you look at the fall-out list, when will my players choose the -1d6 stat instead of the 1d4 trait? Never. So why is it on the list? For me it's exactly like it wouldn't be on the list. When will it have harder consequences? Only when the Dogs get injured or die. But - as the book states rightfully - the players decide when they jeopardize their characters, so if the players want, than the fall-out consists of nothing else, than newer and newer d4 traits. The injuries are mended again by a conflict, and I can only win conflicts against them if I attack them with weapons or guns. Is Dogs really so much about knives and guns? I mean, yes, of course, shoot in the head on the street, and sneak in and attack with an axe while sleeping, but these scenes can only get strong if the whole session doesn't consist mostly of these.<br/><br/>And if I could hit the players hard emotionally without the help of the rules (town generation, conflict resolution), than, heck, I could do that in DnD, I wouldn't need Dogs. I think the emotionally thing only works when there is a significant chance of failure - even of intentional failure.<br/><br/>At least that's how I see it right now. Maybe it would've been more fun if I would've escalated before the players and maybe they would've been frightened of the chance of injuries, but long term it doesn't solve the problem, if I see it right. I can't think of anything else as solution than to take away the chance from the players to decide on the fall-out list. Is this totally going opposite the spirit of the game or story gaming?<br/><br/>And thanks again for your input, and sorry that I'm a bit lost and frustrated by the experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196207/#Comment_196207" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T20:07:53+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  8:07PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As other people have said, it's what the NPC is doing to you that determines the size of the fallout dice. If they're shooting you, and raise with an 16, and you see that with 1 2 3 3 3 4, that's going to be 6d10 fallout dice, not 6d4.<br/><br/>Likewise, remember, even if you're just talking, Talking the Blow doesn't mean a clever refutation of somebody's argument or even shrugging it off. It means the attack leaves a mark, so to speak. So when your Aunt is spitting in your face and calling you a worthless disgrace to the Order, are you really going to take the blow? What about when a sorcerer who's packing 5d10 demonic influence dice whispers in your ear to reject the King of Life and all his empty promises, with dark tendrils of hate curling around your mind, and raises with a 20?<br/><br/>Also, regarding fallout: "All of these choices you get to make, whatever you choose, you have to justify it out of the events of the conflict." You don't just get to add "Awesome 1d4" to your character sheet because your aunt spat in your face and you stood there shocked and hurt. It needs to be an <i>appropriate</i> new trait, and if you can't justify it to your fellow players, well, you (or any other player) is within their rights to ask them to justify it better, or pick something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196210/#Comment_196210" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T20:16:42+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  8:16PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>On the flipside, about always choosing the +1d4 over the -1d6 fallout: it works differently for different groups.

It lets you take away a trait that doesn't make sense for your character anymore. So, barring that, I don't know when you would choose to take it, but at least there is one "good" use.<br>\n<br/>\n  I am a "No one get hurt" kind of player (and GM), but I still find it pretty easy to push the "characters" buttons. You have to look at it through the lens of progressing sin to play it "right" though. The simplest, most basic sin in the book is Pride. Think about it. The "bad guys" don't just want to do their thing and maybe get sanction for it. They want to prove to the Dogs that they are right and the Dogs are wrong. They want to flout their superiority and their transcendence above the Dog's Authority. Every single character who is part of the "problem" in a Town started by being too Proud to submit themselves to the King of Life. Think about that mentality, then play it. You are right, almost every person in a Town just wants to live their life and get on with their daily activities. EXCEPT for those people that are part of the problem. They want to prove they are right and get acknowledgment for their innovation or revolution. Of course, they may be sly about it at first. But once the cat is out of the bag, they are going to push until the Dogs leave or accept their moral, mental and/or physical superiority.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think you are right, there is a balancing act between forcing the issue and letting the players tell their story. But there is also fertile ground their for great story telling if you pull out the stops and let the players do what they want too. Like, there has been more than one time that a NPC has pulled his gun, shoved it right in the face of a Dog and has been talked down. That is an awesome feeling (as a player and a GM) when a character hits that Clint-level of badassery that he can win a gun fight without drawing his gun! But, it is never going to happen if you aren't willing to take responsibility for your part of the story and push the conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, if you are already doing all this and you just didn't express it (or I didn't pick it up from the thread), sorry. But if not, I hope it helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does that make sense?

The character had found the faith and come west, leaving his mother behind. <br/><br/>He'd brought his past into a conflict when dealing with a guy who was shamed because in order to save the family farm his wife had to sleep with miners for money. The guy was angry and the guy says something like, "That's only because you were jealous. I don't know if it was of attention, or because you wanted to lie with your mother yourself, but you were jealous of those man and all your faith is just based on running away from the problem like a coward." <br/><br/>So, you wanna take the blow and admit that you abandoned your mother because you wanted to fuck her?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196291/#Comment_196291" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T12:44:16+00:00" title="March  9, 2009 12:44PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whatever trait they do take for fallout should make sense, but other than that requisite, I don't think the trait's name should be all that important.

Sometimes they don't even help you stay in those conflicts, as your opponent will often be able to Reverse the Blow and get to double up his big dice while exhausting your small ones.<br/><br/>Consider that on average, you need to use 3d4 (expected value 7.5) to see 2d6 (EV 7), and 5d4 (EV 12.5) to see 2d10 (EV 11) \u2014 the fallout builds up quickly.  On top of that, your opponent will be able to see even your best possible d4-powered raises (that is, 8) with 1/8 of his d8s and fully 30% of his d10s!  Against Demonic Influence and other d10 traits, d4s are serious baggage.

No dispute.<br/><br/>They do it by letting you stay in conflicts longer, at greater risk to yourself. This is how injuries and personal weaknesses work in movies too! Next time you watch an action flick, check it out.<br/><br/>There's no math or mechanical reason a player wouldn't rather have a d4 than not, ever.
