Any suggestions on how to's or which one's to buy/use?  <br/>Am I correct in guessing that those game in-a-box are very lite RPG/LARP type games?  Are they appropriate for non-gamers?

It's fairly easy, really, even with non-roleplayers. Simply don't tell them it's actually roleplaying, just a party-game, and they tend to lose their preconceptions about orcs, elves and badly smelling teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to give you some advice, it would be to give everyone their roles before the event so they're in character as soon as they step in the door, and also to cook a nicelooking, tasty and thematically suitable meal. This also means cooking something that'll fit with the costumes, such as avoiding food to be eaten with your hands if the ladies wear long gloves as part of the theme and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a spot of wine helps loosen tension and inhibitions the beginning and makes for a more immersive game. And no, don't get everyone roaring drunk, that's not what I mean.

The 'murder-mystery' gives the events a coherent and familiar subject for the evening to revolve around and a historical theme (usually the 1930s) promotes a shared vision and codes of social conduct; could another subject and theme be equally successful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266071/#Comment_266071" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T05:04:26+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  5:04AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played in two.

People really got into their roles, and cared about achieving their objectives. <br/><br/>My best experience was when a player gutted information out of me simply by using his flair and some efficient psychological manipulation. As I was the murderer, it was in a tough spot, but in the end I managed to save the situation by turning the rest of the audience against him so that he could not use his information. Excellent duels of wits and roleplay, totally unencumbered by rules and logistics, and this years before the development of "indie" games.<br/><br/>I also had some of my best roleplay moments in these kind of evenings, which is surprising considering how little preparation they required compared to regular tabletop games (although with some indie games, the situation has improved in terms if of reduced workload, not in roleplay).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266624/#Comment_266624" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T08:36:00+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  8:36AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played one some years back.

For instance, the group plays a group of old friends who have this annual (or monthly, whatever) dinner, and one of the regular attendees was murdered between last dinnerparty and this one. Someone did it, the killer (of course) knows, but everyone would have had a reason to do it. The killer can try to shift the blame and make the others believe someone else did it. No killing off guests, no need for a body or hidden weapons, just good old fashioned intrigue and investigation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268057/#Comment_268057" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T09:27:03+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  9:27AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tore,<br/><br/>That's exactly how most of these "Host a Murder" things work.
