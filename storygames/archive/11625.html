Consequently our <i>Top Secret</i> and <i>Top Secret S/I</i> games involved a lot of Cold War machinations, and with a heavy dose of <a href="http://readgoldeagle.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Gold Eagle Books</a> being the norm, we killed an awful lot of Commies.  Mostly KGB agents and their minions, but Commies nonetheless.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was thinking about those relatively simple games and comparing them to what seems to be the standard of gaming here at Story Games.  Just a cursory examination of the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11445" rel="nofollow">bite-sized AP thread</a> reveals a lot of sophisticated storytelling going on.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of room for the kinds of games where you just do a lot of Commie killing.<br/><br/>Now, feel free to substitute your cannon fodder of choice here.  Maybe it's orcs or the faceless minions of Fu Manchu or whatever.  The point is that they exist primarily to be killed by the PCs, not engaged in a sophisticated battle of wits.<br/><br/>I wonder if we have the time or the inclination to play the kind of games I'm talking about.  Games that aren't full of angst and moral dilemmas and the like.  Which isn't to say that sophisticated gaming is necessary <i>bad</i>.  I don't mean to imply that at all.  I'm simply wondering if maybe we've lost touch with a more basic, cathartic mode of play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259185/#Comment_259185" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T05:09:27+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:09AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nope.

By this I mean, I've never ever characterized my own gaming as "I just want to kill Commies", so the whole idea of me being free or not free to do it doesn't even enter into it. I don't know, I guess I'm free to do it? I could, if I wanted to? It's not a painful piece of identity cruft or a sordid secret in my closet, so the whole classification of killing-Commies vs. not-killing-Commies seems arbitrary.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with using personally relevant categorization schemes, of course - I've been known to use things like GNS to characterize different roleplaying options even while others see nothing relevant in them.<br/><br/>However, what I'm interested in is this: do you think that this killing-Commies business maps to some specific creative goals in playing the game in the first place? You make it sound like an antithesis of story-focused gaming, so maybe what you're asking is whether we're allowed to play games that do not have a story focus? I wouldn't characterize my own adventure gaming as low-brow in the way your Commie-killing makes it sound, but if it counts, then I have to say that I definitely am allowed to play non-story games. Maybe the gaming police just doesn't know where I live, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259207/#Comment_259207" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T05:54:42+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:54AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're OK with it, but I find that sort of thing rather dull nowadays.

If there is a "simple" aesthetic to go back to in the games of my youth, then it is the incessant striving for emulating Lord of the Rings in fantasy adventure form.<br/><br/>Considering it, I wouldn't characterize the goals and play that we engaged in back then "simple". If anything, it was all too complex and engaged with tools too few and ill-fitting to really make the game deliver consistently. I'm a bit skeptical if there is such a thing as simple roleplaying - to me it seems that people only characterize their roleplaying as simple and unconceited (as if anything you do freely and for fun could be conceited) when they want to take an anti-intellectual tack on the whole endeavour. When you dig beneath the surface, I haven't really encountered gaming styles or traditions that would truly be "simple"; there's always a lot of nuance and skill involved in roleplaying, and many goals that can be pushed quite far.<br/><br/>I think I believe that "simple" is something that happens when you want clear systems and a back to basics approach with quick payoffs. That is not particularly attached to adventure games or story games or any other specific set of goals and methods, I think. In fact, my game <i>Zombie Cinema</i> is to my eyes very much a "simple" approach to story games.

It's mostly done as a one-shot. Until recently, we'd be using RECON, since making characters was relatively simple, and EVERYONE knows the rules by heart. And lots of good explosions, bloody deaths, one-shot kills, etc. We even have a few alternate settings we can throw in if we don't want to be killing Charlie, such as a Aliens hack, a Predator hack (we actually played out the story for the original comic of Alien vs. Predator, which was a friggin' HOOT), modern counter-terrorism hack, and a Terminator hack (we kinda had to, since Palladium seems far too entrenched in their financial problems and the morass known as RIFTS). Lately, though, we've been using Dogs of W*A*R for the same thing, particularly because it's a bit more on the heroic side. Less of the players getting killed, more of the badguys getting killed.<br/><br/>It's a kind of catharsis. Gets rid of the stress of having to deal with botching a roll when rolling 9 or 10 dice in Vampire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259245/#Comment_259245" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T07:38:59+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  7:38AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to wrap my mind around what I think about this subject and I keep revising what I want to say.  So I've decided to just say some stuff and maybe I'll change my mind about some of it.<br/><br/>So here's the blunt first response:  That's bad/wrong fun.  Like, seriously.  (But maybe only for me.)<br/><br/>When I was a teen, we played my buddy's game CrimeWave in which we enacted twisted power-fantasies of harm and mayhem.  It was not at all sophisticated.  Frankly, it was sick.  I wouldn't play that now.  During that same time, I'd play D&amp;D and kill orcs just because that's what we were supposed to do.  I don't play that now, either.<br/><br/>Now, I have a hard time seeing orcs (much less commies) as anything other than another tribe of people.  I think I *have* grown out of that mode of play.  Thank God!<br/><br/>But it's not the violence.  I like violence just fine.  In real life, I think violence is frequently the most fitting answer to a huge class of problems.  It's the immorality of it all.  When I was a kid, I was still trying to decide who to be, but I've decided to be a particular flavor of good person.  And that stance doesn't have any room for othering big classes of people.  And when I see that happening for real, and being a big problem in the real world, it just doesn't sit right as fantasy to play through.  It's immoral!<br/><br/>But it also might be important to have had the chance to play that way first.  I'm not sure on that.  And it's also not that clear-cut.  I have no problem playing war games.  I don't necessarily even have a problem being wicked in RPGs if it's set up the right way...I'm still trying to figure that one out.  Playing 3:16 made me uncomfortable.  Being not nice while playing IAWA is fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley" title="MickBradley"><img alt="MickBradley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.canonpuncture.com/wp-content/uploads/mick-blackhat1001.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley">MickBradley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259246/#Comment_259246" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T07:51:33+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  7:51AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, maybe the question to ask at this point is, which easy-to-label groups of they-who-are-not-like-us are on your "okay to just kill, without moral dilemma" list, and which ones are not?<br/><br/>Whoever is on that list for you and your friends, go have fun killing them and getting your catharsis.

I just killed a whole bunch of hobgoblin commies at an open session last night (then was part of a TPK at the hands of a crypto-fascist ochre jelly... ::sigh::).  There's a standing invitation that's been extended to you, specifically, to play carry if you don't want to just kill commies.  If you're not finding enough basic, cathartic gaming around, I'm not sure it's a philosophical problem with the hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259251/#Comment_259251" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T08:19:14+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  8:19AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find my gaming tastes are much like my taste in movies.

The guys we were killing weren't BAD guys, just the guys on the other side at the moment.<br/><br/>So I guess I've grown out of simple moralities, but haven't grown out of cathartic violence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259263/#Comment_259263" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T09:03:51+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  9:03AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: FigureFour</cite>So I guess I've grown out of simple moralities, but haven't grown out of cathartic violence.</blockquote>\nThis is well said and also where I'm at.

Nor can I do much if you don't read what I'm actually writing on the subject.<br/><br/>To whit: I'm fully aware that D&amp;D is the most popular system out there and lends itself well to hack and slash play.  That has nothing to do with the topic, nor am I saying I lack sufficient hack-and-slash in my gaming diet.  I'm saying, and have reiterated more than once in the thread so far, that I'm talking about <i>this group of players</i>, ones that don't use D&amp;D as their go-to system, and whether <i>this group of players</i> has room in its tent for narratively simple games that center around cathartic acts of violence over narrative sophistication.  But while we're on the subject, I'm not even sure it's fair to label D&amp;D players as hack-and-slashers, as I would suspect most D&amp;D games are at least a little more involved than that.  This is certainly what I'm seeing in various D&amp;D APs, though I'm still not of the mind to play the game.<br/><br/>At any rate, I don't mean to be snarky, but I'm not sure how to express my "agenda" more clearly than I have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259275/#Comment_259275" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T09:28:21+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  9:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2010 9:33AM by Sam!.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: FigureFour</cite>Didn't Sam just just say that he's interested in people's opinions on whether or not they feel they have grown out of that style of play?

Sometimes just blasting stuff is the order of the day, while a more involved, narratively sophisticated game is exactly right for another time.  So to answer my own question: I don't think <i>I</i> have grown out of that kind of gaming.  I'm still interested in a layered roleplaying experience, but I'm also very attached to the sort of gaming I did when I was in my teens and wouldn't object to more of the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259279/#Comment_259279" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T09:42:22+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  9:42AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>Lately, though, we've been using Dogs of W*A*R for the same thing, particularly because it's a bit more on the heroic side.

Because it seems like exactly the right thing to do with the system.<br/><br/>And for those wondering: it's Italian Communists because I'm shamelessly stealing the plot of the Mack Bolan novel, <a href="http://www.mackbolan.com/display.php3?num=59" rel="nofollow">Tuscany Terror</a>, not because I have anything specifically against Italians.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley" title="MickBradley"><img alt="MickBradley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.canonpuncture.com/wp-content/uploads/mick-blackhat1001.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley">MickBradley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259287/#Comment_259287" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T10:07:46+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 10:07AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite><cite>Posted By: FigureFour</cite>Didn't Sam just just say that he's interested in people's opinions on whether or not they feel they have grown out of that style of play?

As I indicated to Daniel, there's not a whole lot I can do if people want to draw conclusions totally at odds with what I've written, but I don't much appreciate the threadcrapping.<br/>Okay, if you're really just asking, then I'll try to give you my honest answer.<br/><br/>BUT ... I don't speak for anyone but myself. Ever. I don't think most people would consider me much a part of "this group", and to whatever extent I identify with the issues and play-styles often discussed here, I'm still just one guy giving an opinion. And no matter how I express my opinion, I don't intend it to come off as elitist indie-evangelist fun-police snobbery. Although apparently that's a pretty prevalent reaction to the things I write and say about roleplaying. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My opinion: I'm not interested in the type of play you're talking about and I never really have been. So I can't say I've grown out of it. I don't grok the notion of an evening of "just killing [insert favorite generic class of faceless adversaries]" as being cathartic. It has always bothered me. I think that what we do says something about what we are, even in a game. On the other hand I know that lots of people - including some of my close friends - believe that rpgs are a fine and acceptable way to blow off steam, and think I'm a nutjob for suggesting that such play says anything at all about who we are. And maybe I am. Probably I am. But I do know this much - if *I* were to enjoy/desire that sort of play, it would definitely be saying something about *me*. Which very likely makes me a rather sick puppy, all in all.<br/><br/>Which means I'm not an easy guy to play with, or be rpg-buddies with, etc. Or be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259290/#Comment_259290" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T10:17:22+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 10:17AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MickBradley</cite>I'm still just one guy giving an opinion.

Gaming is pretty much my primary *creative* outlet.  I don't write.  I don't paint.  I don't sculpt.  I game.  My investment in gaming is as a personal artistic exercise.<br/><br/>There are, however, exceptions.  For a game to work for me in the mode you're describing there really needs to be other system components in place that are fun to manipulate and play with.  For example, I have a fondness for low level (1 through 8 or so) tactical D&amp;D.  I like moving the minis around and setting up cool set-piece fights with little tactical twists.  After 8th level or so though, the tactical options become overwhelming and it stops being fun and becomes more like work.<br/><br/>Another exception is: The Committee For The Exploration of Mysteries.  This is pretty much pure over-the-top nazi-punching fun.<br/><br/>Sons of Liberty also has Founding Fathers take it the Redcoats with a zany card game.<br/><br/>These games are pretty much fun as GAMES with some bad-guy-punching verbiage pasted on top.  That's why they work for me in this mode.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259320/#Comment_259320" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T11:56:59+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 11:56AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>If all you're looking for are data points and personal anecdotes then here's mine[....]</blockquote>\nAnd thank you for it.

It was fun, but I kept on having real issues fighting anything that was a person! Like, there were these thugs that were obviously a low-intensity fight waiting to happen, and I think I rolled every skill on my sheet to not fight, and then i was casting my healing spells on them after my party-mates took 'em down cuz I didn't want to be a murderer. I, the player, felt kind of nauseous at the thought of intentionally hitting other fictional human beings with a mace.  <br/><br/>But fighting monsters and undead was absolutely not a problem at all.

When I was pretty young he played a game of D&amp;D with me and my friends to make sure it wasn't Satanic or something. He ended up playing a thief and in the game was stealing from pretty much every character in the game. At one point I told him he shouldn't/couldn't do that and he asked me why. I told him that it wasn't good, and he might get in trouble. He asked me if those two things were the same -- if he wasn't good and didn't get in trouble did it matter, and if he was good but still got in trouble, what then? <br/><br/>I dunno why he asked a 9 year old those questions, but he did. And shit like that ended up getting into my games. Why have a thief if he doesn't steal? If he does steal then what? And what if he is bad but doesn't get in trouble? <br/><br/>Thanks dad, you boned up my childhood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259433/#Comment_259433" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T17:50:31+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:50PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I encountered this passage today, and it reminded me of this thread:\n<blockquote><cite>W.R. Irwin, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Game of the Impossible: A Rhetoric of Fantasy</span>. University of Illinois Press, 1976</cite>Tolkien . . . defends and praises fantasy more than he describes it, but from his evaluating comments understanding may be inferred. Enchantment, that result of fantasy in both the reader and the work, is better than magic. Magic is a technique designed to achieve power in the primary world; enchantment is a condition that fosters both art and faith. "Fantasy is a natural human activity." As such, it is the ally, not the enemy, of reason. A clear [faculty of] reason is needed to make successful fantasy and to prevent the abuses by which fantasy can deteriorate into its opposite, "Morbid Delusion." Moreover, it helps maintain a keen perception of what is real and what is not. It recognizes facts, but refuses to be enslaved by them. "If men really could not distinguish between frogs and men, fairy-stories about frog-kings would not have arisen." Further, as a natural human activity, fantasy asserts the right of man to be a maker, within the limits of his power, which is an expression of his having been made in the divine image. And what he makes, if he remain true to fact and nonfact, will not only do much to mitigate his fallen state but will also form an opposition to the ugliness and unnaturalness brought forth into the world by those who seek power for the wrong reasons. </blockquote>\nIrwin is summarizing Tolkien's view on fantasy there, and what's neat is the association asserted among fantasy, truth, and reason, standing in direct contrast with "morbid delusion" (probably accompanied by self-deception and casuistry). I particularly like the assertion that fantasy <i>matters</i> in the real world, because it defies those who would argue that, oh, it doesn't mean anything. <i>Well, y'know, it kinda means something</i>.<br/><br/>Anyway: when I was 16, working through power fantasies about defeating dragons and slaying orcs helped me. At 44, not so much. The only way I can slay orcs now is ironically--but irony is the language of Poughkeepsie, not Elfland (to borrow Ursula K. Leguin's technique for culling bad fantasy from good). Tolkien talks about "enchantment" as a property of fantasy: okay, Professor, I'm right there with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259435/#Comment_259435" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T17:56:19+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:56PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>At one point I told him he shouldn't/couldn't do that and he asked me why.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clint Krause</cite>I've played many different types of games, but I personally prefer stuff that's a little bit low brow and a lot bit violent.  That said, I've no problem with folks who like more serious/weighty stuff (other than the occasional eye-roll when people get over-the-top pretentious about it).</blockquote>\nI tend to be of the same mind, Clint.  As much as I enjoy a good action, I enjoy an action-oriented game just as well.  Interestingly enough, I don't much go for the tactical sort of action, where everything is scrupulously tracked with minis and/or markers, but something more abstracted.<br/><br/>When I posited this thread I wondered if maybe the collective pursuit of seriousness and weight had made the action game pass\xe9.  I suspect there are quite a few folks, including right here on Story Games, that are either actively scratching their action itch with their games or are wishing they could, but not participating in such a way that their preferences are out there for everyone to see.  There seems to be this idea that roleplaying should Be About Stuff, as opposed to being escapist entertainment, and I'm not sure that's where everybody wants to go.  Sometimes you just want to kill the bad guys, as the subject line says.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261189/#Comment_261189" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T09:46:30+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:46AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>I wonder if we have the time or the inclination to play the kind of games I'm talking about.  Games that aren't full of angst and moral dilemmas and the like.  Which isn't to say that sophisticated gaming is necessary<i>bad</i>.  I don't mean to imply that at all.  I'm simply wondering if maybe we've lost touch with a more basic, cathartic mode of play.</blockquote>\nI get my catharsis in a different way. I play Dogs in the Vineyard and do terrible, terrible things with a straight face and no apologies, all the while basking in the irony that my friends and I know how awful it all is. I run My Life with Master and play the Master to the hilt, pushing the minions as hard as I can. I do such awful things as the Master, that I insist that we don't stop until the minions have learned Love and have overthrown the Master and killed him. I play 3:16 and take every opportunity to showcase my trooper as a mindless killing machine. My trooper follows orders and does his duty, but I know that he's a serial killer. I GM carry, a game about war, and I push the grunts hard, watching their troops fall around them because of the decisions they made. I know how it makes them feel, how it makes me feel. <br/><br/>When I'm done playing those games, I feel like we all got the point of it. Some horrible things went down in the fiction, but I can tell from the reactions of the players that they understand the horror of what their characters did. It was still fun. We were able to separate that moment of triumph when our 3:16 soldier killed 1d100 people in a single burst of fire from the reality that we also felt a little disgusted by it.<br/><br/>I guess I'm saying that to achieve catharsis, I don't need to act out a power fantasy where I /get off/ on killing some "other" group. I can step into that power fantasy and be /disgusted/ by it, and get the same cathartic feel. At the end of the game, I don't go, "Yeah, it's okay that we killed those dudes." I know it's wrong. It's okay that we role-played killing those dudes, though. <br/><br/>I suspect that most of the folks posting actively on Story Games are here because they want a certain kind of game that isn't about mindless killing. "Mindless killing," to me, means a bunch of killing without any story. It's no surprise that story gamers don't want killing without story. And I mean story in a bigger sense than "a series of events in time," in case you're wondering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261196/#Comment_261196" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T10:01:43+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 10:01AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I guess I'm saying that to achieve catharsis, I don't need to act out a power fantasy where I /get off/ on killing some "other" group.

From the perspective of my teenaged self I definitely wasn't self-aware enough to draw the internal distance necessary to enjoy something in its badness.  And I believe there are certain groups (like Nazis) that no one's going to feel guilty about killing in the most ingenious ways.  I only used Commies as an example because that was the target group of many a youthful game.<br/><br/>I would wonder how many people are able to enjoy a game in the way you describe, though.  I've touched on the topic of playing bad (if not outright evil) characters and/or doing terrible things in the game fiction and for every response like yours I've gotten I've received one with someone turning their nose up.

I feel guilty about role-playing killing Nazi <i>people</i>. I also feel guilty about role-playing anything where I lump a huge group of people into some label that makes it easy for me to kill them.\n<blockquote>I would wonder how many people are able to enjoy a game in the way you describe, though.</blockquote>\nIn my experience running the games I listed, above, almost all of them enjoy it. They laugh and shake their head at the Awful, knowing it is Awful, but have a great time at it.\n<blockquote>I've touched on the topic of playing bad (if not outright evil) characters and/or doing terrible things in the game fiction and for every response like yours I've gotten I've received one with someone turning their nose up.</blockquote>\nI suspect they're turning their nose up at the way you approach the subject, not the subject itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261306/#Comment_261306" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T13:12:06+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  1:12PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "And I believe there are certain groups (like Nazis) that no one's going to feel guilty about killing in the most ingenious ways."<br/><br/>Really?<br/><br/>I just watched Inglorious Basterds last week.<br/><br/>Part of what's cool about Inglorious Basterds was that it took this idea to its logical conclusion: to the Basterds, Nazis aren't really even human, it doesn't matter what we do to them!  We can beat them to death with baseball bats, carve up their living flesh, and scalp them as trophies!  And like many Tarantino flicks, it made you simultaneously identify with, and be appalled by, the "heroes."<br/><br/>Kinda like Adam was talking about.  On the one hand you have Hitler riddled with machinegun bullets, his corpse twitching on the ground, and you're like "awesome!"  And when Hans Landa gets his in the end, you hate him so much by then you love every second of the horrifying scene.<br/><br/>But you've also got the drunk officer who just desperately wants to get back to his newborn child Maxmilian, the sergeant who gets his head beaten in by "The Bear-Jew" in the first scene, and the soldier who wants to go burn his uniform who gets carved up anyway as a matter of procedure.<br/><br/>The Basterds are barely recognizable as human beings.  They're killing machines, human weapons, vessels of hatred and violence who happen to be pointed at a bunch of bad guys who are bad enough bad guys that nothing is supposed to be too bad for them -- as you say.<br/><br/>But if you watched it and got *only* the "YEAH AWESOME KICK SOME ASS!" part and not *also* the "oh shit that is fucked up man that is really fucked up" part, then I don't know where you're coming from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261307/#Comment_261307" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T13:14:19+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  1:14PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Holy shit someone else got what I got out of Inglorious Basterds!</p>\n<p>Too many people go into that movie thinking it is Kill Bill.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261311/#Comment_261311" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T13:25:47+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  1:25PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just chiming in that I play action-oriented games almost exclusively.

I'm not saying blasting Commies/Nazis/Unitarians is superior to other modes of play, either.

A lot of people are reading it that way, but I'm 99% sure that what Sam was trying to do was discuss the sort of play Adam was describing as "power fantasy?" and people's opinions of it. Specifically if people felt it was "childish" or that they had "grown out of it".<br><br>I'm pretty sure that the only reason "commies" were mentioned is because Sam did his "power fantasy?" gaming in America during the 80s playing espionage games.

A lot of people are reading it that way, but I'm 99% sure that what Sam was trying to do was discuss the sort of play Adam was describing as "power fantasy?" and people's opinions of it. Specifically if people felt it was "childish" or that they had "grown out of it".<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that the only reason "commies" were mentioned is because Sam did his "power fantasy?" gaming in America during the 80s playing espionage games. Commies/Russians were the generic villains of that genre just like terrorists/Arabs are now.<br/>Thank you, Dylan, for getting it.<br/><br/>If you go back and actually read the original post, you'll see that I use Commies as an example because, as Dylan points out, they were the enemy of choice during that period for espionage games.  These days it would likely be something else, probably Islamic terrorists, and there would be nothing wrong with that.  In fact, I'd be surprised if they weren't the staple of a Gold Eagle-style campaign.  And speaking of which, it might be helpful if some of the more scandalized participants in the discussion actually took some time to visit <a href="http://www.mackbolan.com/" rel="nofollow">MackBolan.com</a> and saw what I mean by Gold Eagle.  Just read a few synopses of Mack Bolan's adventures after <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2339&amp;Mode=like">#39</a> to see there were a lot of Commies being slain in those books, as well, throughout the early- to mid-'80s.<br/><br/>Anyway, you'll also note upon reading the post that I allowed for a whole variety of "preferred enemy," including orcs and the like.  As I've lamented more that once during the conversation since, I should have used Nazis as my primary example because at least then there would be no question what we were talking about.<br/><br/>So, to make it clear: no, I'm not referring to Story Games members as Communists and, no, this is not an enticement to kill the <i>actual</i> Commies that are left out there.  Though you <i>could</i> try to revive some of the Cold War-styled games by positing China as the enemy.  It would be a little subtler than including Russians in the old games, but I suspect it could be done.

Both are times that I've tried to play a more non violent game in a hack and slash orc killing marathon.<br/><br/>Now, I've never felt bad about genociding some orcs, and I probably never will except in the most abstract way. I play all sorts of war games and strategy games and am perfectly comfortable wishing for the imaginary deaths of imaginary people. They don't have hopes, dreams, families or a future. They're game pieces. I can IMAGINE that they have those things, then I can speculate that if I was really involved in their deaths, that would be bad, but I don't actually feel anything close to guilt or regret for killing them.<br/><br/>However, In reality, I'm a pretty non-violent guy, so I've enjoyed exploring that sort of fiction, where my character is appalled by the sort of violent tropes of the stereotypical fantasy gaming world. It's got nothing to do with MY feelings about killing hobgoblins, and everything to do with my feelings on what makes an interesting person and what makes that persons interactions with the world around him interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261573/#Comment_261573" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T05:25:53+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  5:25AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>If you go back and actually read the original post, you'll see that I use Commies as an example because, as Dylan points out, they were the enemy of choice during that period for espionage games.</blockquote>\nSam, I got that from post one.

If I'm playing a heroic paladin who falls to his knees and weeps with guilt after killing a hundred orcs, that doesn't mean that I'm feeling the same way. I probably enjoyed every minute of the big orc killing fight (assuming it wasn't tedious, for the sake of arguement) and then thought "Wow. This paladin thinks of himself as a good guy, and he just killed an entire TOWN. That's sort of fucked up."<br><br>Like I said, I don't feel guilt over imagining that an imaginary guy killed some other imaginary guys (well, not very often). I also don't feel bad when I win a game of Warhammer (despite the fact that I just ordered the deaths of dozens of innocent plastic lizardmen) or when "I" jump on another harmless Koopa Troopa. <br><br>That doesn't mean I don't think that exploring those feeling in the fictional context isn't interesting or meaningful, but it's not interesting in every game I play.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261601/#Comment_261601" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T07:41:55+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  7:41AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyway, I'm going to do my part to stop the threadcrapping and am going to discontinue responding to trolls.<br><br><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=2157" rel="nofollow">FigureFour</a> has a solid guideline for responses to this sort of discussion that I think I'm going to adopt from here on out: "If your comment is about politics or history instead of about games, don't post it."<br/><br/>And on that note, I'm going to absent myself until someone has something to say about <i>gaming</i> that relates to the actual topic of the thread.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261627/#Comment_261627" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T09:05:33+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  9:05AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam,<br/><br/>I'm re-reading your original post to try to understand what it is you really want out of this thread.

It's not about communism, it's about the kind of games that involve a "bad guy" group and how we as gamers react to those games.<br/><br/>Actually, that reminds me of a gamer I used to know who refused to play "war games". Interestingly enough, he didn't mean tabletop strategy war games (he actually played those occasionally), or even roleplaying games about a war, he was talking about games where one group was "the bad guy" and the players job was to stop them at all costs.<br/><br/>It seems to me that certain gamers tend to react that way to ANY game, which I find pretty interesting. I don't know if it's habits formed in old "power fantasy" games (it does seem prevalent in gamers who grew up with D&amp;D), the moral distancing effect of knowing your "enemies" are imaginary, a desire to "win" the game or some combination of factors, but I've routinely observed gamers identify a person or group within the fiction and then "go to war on" that person or group.<br/><br/>Heck, I've noticed that behavior in myself sometimes, and I still don't know what it's all about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261644/#Comment_261644" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T09:40:24+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  9:40AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "it's about the kind of games that involve a "bad guy" group and how we as gamers react to those games"<br/><br/>I have actually enjoyed those kinds of games a great deal, for many years.

If that's less satisfying, why? <br/><br/>And if you don't want to come up with fictional justification for this guy really deserving to be hunted and put down like an animal, why not? Why does that ruin the game for you?<br/><br/>There's no judgment meant here, either. I play D&amp;D 4E and happily mow down the enemy and don't think too much about it, and I'm pretty sure my character feels really justified doing it (see "4b," above). But I have to admit that I feel icky about it LATER, when I'm reflecting on how my character flung fire on the baby-kobold-infested huts with the glee of a flamethrower-carrying soldier in Vietnam.

Or better yet, take the political/cultural ideology that you, your family, friends, community, actually tend to support and then think about playing a character who enjoys killing THAT group. Would you as a player still get the catharsis you're looking for? Would it still be the simple game that you played when you were younger?<br/><br/>In other words, replace your cardboard bad-guys cannon fodder group with a cardboard version of a group that has your own cultural/political ideology, and then answer your original question for the rest of us.

It was a "have you stopped beating your wife" kind of question.<br/><br/>So I guess, to make you happy by not addressing anything but the overt, foreground content of the post, we would have to respond this way:<br/><br/>"No."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261767/#Comment_261767" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T23:50:01+00:00" title="March 12, 2010 11:50PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZGZZlM-AJo" rel="nofollow">This seems relevant.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261769/#Comment_261769" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T00:27:37+00:00" title="March 13, 2010 12:27AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I swear, I just want to give Ira Glass a big ol' hug.

The players seized on that and set out to completely annihilate their gathering place, sniping them with .460 Weatherbys, setting the place on fire, and mowing down flaming figures as they tried to escape.  Being Germans, I do think there was some catharsis in that.<br/><br/>On the other hand, both of my grandfathers were drafted into the army during WW2.  One of them into the Kriegsmarine, where he spent most of his time on French fishing boats making sure they didn't smuggle anything.  He was forced to join the Nazi party by threat of having his own high-seas fishing boat confiscated (non-party members could not own businesses).  Then after the war he was accused of being a Nazi by virtue of being a party member.  The other one served on the Eastern front and doesn't really talk about that (I don't blame him), except to point out that when the war was coming to a close, they raced West to make sure it was the Americans who took them captive instead of the Russians.<br/><br/>And so it becomes difficult to "just kill nazis and feel great about it" when that would include my grandparents.  At least neo-nazis <i>chose </i>to affiliate with evil, maybe that's why that KULT example came up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
