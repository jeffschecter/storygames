A single bite cannot contain the awesome. Although I didn't fully appreciate it at the time (tired, daylight savings time going away) we had a really watershed game of AW last session.<br/><br/>This is an epic campaign we've been playing over Skype for over a year with Brendan and Trevis and a couple other non-story-games-regulars. At this point we've all got second characters (which spreads the screen time thin) - I've been playing a pacifist maestro-turned-hardholder who so far has managed to not kill anyone - except for some collateral damage from a grenade I threw back once. <br/><br/>So, we've got this zombie problem. The maelstrom infects you with white sickness and from there you can be controlled by the entity behind the maelstrom. So a bunch of our citizens turned against the hold but I really didn't want to kill my own people - maybe there's a cure! (I *so* don't want to kill people that when one of my gang tries to sell a white zombie into prostitution I merely exile him from the hold) - so we contacted the maelstrom and tried to cut a deal.<br/><br/>No, wait, I have to go further back. We had this literally androgynous gunlugger, a whitebirth who survived, who assumed (s)he couldn't have children, but then one night in a brain-opened haze (s)he and our skinner got it on. And conceived a child. A child that should not be.<br/><br/>So. When we contacted the maelstrom, what did it want? It wanted a vessel. It wanted to be born. Guess whose child it wanted for that.<br/><br/>So I had to decide. Was I going to give the maelstrom what it wants - saving a hundred of my people at the cost of one child (and one friend) - or was I going to value my friends and their child more than the lives of these people?<br/><br/>Well, I tried to superman the hell out of that choice.  I stalled, lying to the maelstrom and telling it I'll bring it the 'vessel' but then I had our savvyhead work on a cure, hoping he'd deliver before the maelstrom lost its patience.<br/>(Side note: our savvyhead's workspace is also where we contact the maelstrom. That'll be important in a bit.) We round up the now docile zombies and put them in what used to be my establishment, back when I was a maestro.<br/><br/>Now, that gunlugger I mentioned? Recently came to be possessed by the spirit of his/her dead grandfather, who was a brainer, and now (s)he's a brainer too. These things happen. But our skinner talked our savvyhead into fixing the gunlugger. ("What's worse? Some zombies or a psychotic gunlugger?") So our savvyhead did it (earning a delicious xp) - making a containment crystal that imprisoned the ghost, but setting back work on the cure.<br/><br/>Welp. Turns out the gunlugger didn't want to be un-possessed. So (s)he came by the savvyhead's van, all friendly like, grabbed the crystal from its containment field and made off with it.<br/>That sets in motion a string of mixed &amp; botched rolls, and the savvyhead's workspace fucking blows up. (Shouldn't have kept the spare gasoline for his van in there while working, eh?)  All work on the cure is lost, and our connection with the maelstrom is broken. (And the hocus ended up with second degree burns all over his body, but that's another story.)<br/><br/>Yeah, so the zombies are angry again. I open my brain to contact the maelstrom, and hit the 12+. So I have a talk with it. The hocus shows up too - happened to be opening his brain at the same time. The maelstrom is pissed that we broke contact, still wants the vessel, doesn't trust us. The hocus agrees to become possessed by the white and to babysit the carrier of the vessel - there's our concrete assurance. So we've managed to buy a little time.<br/><br/>But I know it's not going to last. So after I come out of the maelstrom, I give the order: "If the zombies act up again, kill them all."<br/><br/>And then I realize I've done it. I've made my choice. I've chosen my friend over my people, and, for the first time, I've made the decision to kill. <br/><br/><br/>---<br/>And, in hindsight, I look back on this sequence of events, and I realize that if I was watching a TV series, I would think it was so fucking <i>contrived </i> that the gunlugger just <i>happened</i> to have this ghost crystal in the van that had the cure. Like the Writer was forcing my character to have to make that choice. But nope, just the way the ball bounced - if we'd hit a 10+ just once when we were trying to save the van we might still have a cure and a complacent maelstrom.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367053/#Comment_367053" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T00:15:52+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 12:15AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "if I was watching a TV series, I would<br/>think it was so fucking contrived that<br/>the gunlugger just happened to have<br/>this ghost crystal in the van that had<br/>the cure."<br/><br/>You kinda lost me there. From what you've described I don't understand how that is contrived. I'm not saying it's not I just understand the context of the contrivance I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
