I'm not sure that we ever implement any of those ideas. This is me trying to fix that.<br/><br/>Please suggest ways we can make sure that first-time attendees feel welcome and included. My ideas:<br/><br/><br/>* Buddy System -- every new person gets assigned an old person to answer questions and make sure they find the fun<br/><br/>* Meet and Greet -- instead of going heads-down into games as soon as you get there, host a formal "everyone takes part" event; certainly someone can turn this into a game of some kind?<br/><br/>* Chores -- give early kitchen duty to some people so they immediately have something in common<br/><br/>* Welcome to Camp Nerdly Pamphlet -- even though everyone supposedly knows how it works from the wiki and whatnot, people don't; produce a short leaflet to explain how things work (I WILL DO THIS)<br/><br/>* Say Hello -- remind yourself often to say hello and meet people you don't know; introduce people you do know to others (this ought to be part of the Nerdly Code)<br/><br/>* Orientation -- some kind of not-stupid and not-boring event to welcome first-time campers to the event<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411552/#Comment_411552" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T09:05:48+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  9:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2013 9:06AM by Nathan_H.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the pamphlet's a neat idea, Adam.  <br/>Maybe a big, lazy game that runs throughout the weekend?

People can spy out what's going on through the conplanner site, or the g+ site, or on here, but that's not exactly outreach.<br/><br/>Dave tries the "meet and great" early on by assaulting people with frisbees.  Would anyone want to volunteer for some indoor instant activities?  Old regulars playing some Uno or whatever with new people as they sign in?  Rotate them through some tables with the agenda to learn more about them?<br/><br/>4pm - 8pm is perfect for this, as it's just arrival, unpacking, and dinner.  There's four prime hours for this, followed by a pitch session and a gaming slot.\n<blockquote>How about a special button/sticker/badge for first-year Owlbears?</blockquote>\nI would challenge the other way around, and I'd volunteer for this too.  What about a badge/button for regulars who are willing to take time to answer questions and get people into games, and put that as their first priority?  Would anyone else do this?  Should it be done in shifts?<br/><br/>Would you be more inclined to volunteer for a buddy system?  With a one to one relationship rather than a "find someone with a badge" model?<br/><br/>I really think the Pitch Sessions go a long way, but there are always going to be people that are too shy to make decisions and introduce themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411566/#Comment_411566" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T09:55:46+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  9:55AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2013 9:56AM by Rafael.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pitch sessions were ultra-confusing and disappointing for me as a first-time attendee.

Maybe we split the difference and randomize seating on Friday night, but leave people to their own devices the rest of camp. Part of the fun of camp is interacting with old friends, and meals are prime interaction time. Of course, there's no harm in reminding people to invite first-timers to sit with you and your friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411587/#Comment_411587" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T13:11:08+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  1:11PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2013 1:11PM by Rafael.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think the pitch sessions must have this "read-only" feel about them, when they're intended to be "read-write."

(I was really hoping to go again this year, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to, due to having a kid who's a little too new to the world to go camping. Sad for me.)<br/><br/>I had a good enough time last year to want to go again, even though there was a normal amount of that "Uh, what's going on here? Am I cool to join this group, or will that be a weird social transgression?" stuff in my head. <br/><br/>But I think that's just how it goes. To be honest, having an assigned buddy or meal group would not have been something I'd have been jazzed about. Sometimes that stuff can just add a layer of protocol and etiquette that you have to also grok as a first-timer.<br/><br/>Which is all by way of saying that Nerdly seemed pretty functional and most everyone was friendly. So don't fret too much! If you're a Nerdly leader, like Adam, you're already doing a pretty decent job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411597/#Comment_411597" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T15:38:18+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  3:38PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of feeling like a gaming convention in the woods, I wish it felt more like camp.  <br/>That is all.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411598/#Comment_411598" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T15:46:43+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  3:46PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2013 3:48PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am happy to talk to newcomers 1-on-1, hear what they're looking for, and recommend games or people to seek out.  I don't know how useful an offer that is without some sort of officially scheduled time block and location for it, but nevertheless, it stands.  Come say hi!  I'm the guy with the frisbee.<br/><br/>I don't have any great ideas for a larger camp structure, other than a short time set aside for everyone to do that (chat with a newcomer), such as 15 minutes after Friday dinner.<br/><br/>As for pitch sessions, I think Rafael perfectly summed up the flaws.  If we could iron those out, it'd be great.  Here's my thought:<br/><br/>1) camp leader gets everyone's attention to focus in on a central spot<br/><br/>2) game leaders pitch games from that central spot, ending each pitch with "I'm gonna go stand over there, join me there if you want in"<br/><br/>3) participants can move to join game leaders whenever they want<br/><br/>4) once the last pitch is complete, the camp leader instructs everyone to go to a game if they really dug the pitch, and to stay put if they have questions or didn't like any of the options<br/><br/>5) everyone with questions about the pitched games will ask, and decide whether to join or remain in the middle<br/><br/>6) the camp leader will then ask everyone in the middle what they'd like to play; if someone in that group can meet that need, great; if no one can, maybe someone else in the room will offer to leave the game they're at and run/facilitate something<br/><br/>I think this would work well for some people, but not for anyone who doesn't like standing in the middle of a room of people and saying what kind of game they want to play (which is probably a common preference).  But, I dunno, I'm sure pitching to a crowd isn't the easiest social feat for all the game leaders either, so maybe all's fair, and this is the best we can do without having pre-con sign-ups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411637/#Comment_411637" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T05:54:00+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  5:54AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having a formal role for someone, a defined job, to be director of the pitch, is a thing to consider.<br/><br/>They would grab the attention, as Dave is putting forward, get people to pitch their game, direct players, and quick;y take note of what game is taking place where.  So game organizers would "check out" essentially and let the director know what game / where / how many / how many open slots are left.<br/><br/>The natural extension of this (to me) seems to be to have that person stick around after all the pitched games have made, questions answered, and people have gone off to begin.  This way they can put together some pick-up games, or organize those that didn't find what they wanted into a group or three.<br/><br/>I know we have plenty of people coming this year that would be comfortable in that role, myself included.\n<blockquote>Instead of feeling like a gaming convention in the woods, I wish it felt more like camp.  <br/>That is all.<br/></blockquote>\nThis comment interests me greatly, but I would like more.

It works fine until there is an overflow situation where seven people want to play a five person game. I think the easy solution to this is to make it a general rule that the people who have been to the most Camp Nerdly's must bow out first.<br/><br/>It is also awkward when someone pitches a game that nobody wants to play - they've made a good faith effort and as a result are locked out of other games, which fill while they are standing there watching.<br/><br/>Another problem is that it is difficult to assemble everyone at one time. The kitchen cleanup crew, for example, has occasionally been shafted by this process.<br/><br/>Now I'm confused by what the ConPlanner site is for.

So having conplanner as a central form of registration / payment / scheduling seems like a good fit up front.  And you can and should sign-up for games on the site.<br/><br/>But to avoid that clique-ish feeling of people secreting themselves off and excluding other people, it would be super cool if people who have a full game still came to the pitch, and said "This game is full unless one of my players hears something they want to play instead."  I mean, it's still an option, right?  I'm not going to be offended if someone makes that call and leaves Puppetland or Itras or something.<br/><br/>And yeah, I've been that guy, who pitches a game and has zero interest.  It sucks.  It sucked doing it for years at D*C.  It sucked harder to have people pass up on games we were offering to <i>watch</i> full games of <del>comment redacted</del> instead of playing a game I really wanted to run.  That's not something even Nerdly can avoid.  It's going to happen.  I can't tell you how many people turned me down for XXXXtreme STREET luge.<br/><br/>But on the flip side, Sea Dracula made last year.  How much more niche can you get?  Nerdly is a cool place where people try to look out for each other, and make sure people have fun for the scarce few hours we get there.  Which means when we dive in we dive in deep.  Yeah, that's a little intimidating up front.<br/><br/>I like this discussion on how to avoid some of the pitfalls, and improve the processes we like using.  It's very useful.  I'm just not sure how much "big" change is needed.  I like a lot of the "little" ideas to even out the playing field.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411664/#Comment_411664" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T09:00:21+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  9:00AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about at each pitch session, a few of us step up and offer to be Explainers (but not Mansplainers), and people can glom onto us and ask questions.

It also places a social expectation of alertness and courtesy onto the people most likely to get all clique-y.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411685/#Comment_411685" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T13:35:38+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  1:35PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seconded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411690/#Comment_411690" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T14:18:30+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  2:18PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thirded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411803/#Comment_411803" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T21:11:25+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  9:11PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe someone could also come up with simple guidelines of what makes a good pitch session to post on here, G+, and the wiki for people who will be running something for the first time. Is this a thing that already exists somewhere? Some of you are pros, but it's kind of intimidating to promote a game when you're new to the pitching concept and/or the Nerdly crowd. Even if someone is still nervous about the presentation, a simple list or guide may help them relax about having said the right thing (and avoid lots of the same questions: "how many people?" "is this okay for my 12-year-old?" etc).<br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411831/#Comment_411831" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T06:26:36+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  6:26AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is an excellent suggestion.  Hopefully I can coordinate with Adam to put together a "welcome to Nerdly" kind of pamphlet, and include that kind of information there as well.<br/><br/>The big points are mostly:<br/><br/>- Rating (some people use MPAA ratings like G or PG-13, but whatever you feel comfortable using) to let everyone know the tone of the game<br/>- Complexity (can you learn it in 5 minutes? are there a lot of moving pieces?)<br/>- Size (how many people do you want, and how tight is that requirement?  2-6?  5-6? 4-20?)<br/>- Fun (you know it's fun, because you like it.  Where is the fun in this game?  Is it the setting?  is it the neat way the mechanics interact?  is it the beautiful pieces on the board and how they inspire imagination?  what can people expect to be fun about this?)<br/><br/>But you can also include other important stuff like <br/>"This is an outdoors game, so we'll be running around a lot" <br/>or "These cards are like my children!  Don't bring cheetos to this table!"<br/>or "This is just a playtest, and I'm [insert progress] far in to it, so mostly I'm looking for feedback on [insert piece]"<br/><br/>The most important part to any good pitch is the Fun, so maybe do that first.  I'm more comfortable with those points in the order I typed them, because I like getting the rest of the stuff out of the way and then talking about the fun, but hey, make the pitch comfortable for you.<br/><br/>Does anyone else have any pointers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411857/#Comment_411857" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T10:58:17+00:00" title="April 11, 2013 10:58AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really liked the old "write it on a giant piece of paper on an easel" method.
