I went to Gencon in 2009 and really didn't.<br/>I'm trying to sort out what changed, and whether it's worth it in the future.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Lots of cool people are there.<br/>2. I can talk to game designers about their cool new products.<br/>3. The rush of being at the center of it all, in the big city, where the buzz is being generated, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. There are no vegetables or fruits available in the downtown core. (please, correct me. I couldn't find any.)<br/>2. Hella expensive.<br/>3. Sweaty and hot.<br/>4. I dislike the heavy commercial aspect to it.<br/>5. I find it hard to actually get a solid gaming schedule in.<br/><br/>So, I'm debating its value.<br/>I don't like buying stuff. I don't like fried food.<br/>I do like games. I do like people.

We solved this first by going to the mall - in the food court there is a place that does Mexican stuff and you could build a big salady meal for lunch without all the rubbish on it. We also found a big organic store a few blocks away, and got tons of fresh fruit, juice etc. I can't remember where it is now or what it's called but I'll try to find out. <br/><br/>2. Expensive. What can I say? The downtown hotels are very pricy. Stay a way out, and come in by bus, or even taxi. It will still be way cheaper.<br/><br/>3. You can spend almost the entire day in AC, if that's what you wish.<br/><br/>4. Commercial? Yep .There are lots of fringe, non-commercial things going on; after hours gaming, for example. You can enjoy yourself for a whole week without buying a single thing for a stand.<br/><br/>5. See 4, plus, you can book yourself solid with games to a rigorous schedule all week if that's what you want.<br/><br/>I'm glad you like to talk to game designers about their cool new game, but your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> might conflict with this a little. Most game designers want to sell their cool new games.<br/><br/>Sound like it's not worth the risk for you, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258012/#Comment_258012" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T05:26:41+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  5:26AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To address your cons\u2026<br/><br/>1. Food:<br/><br/>Quality places to eat if you are vegetarian are scarce but I really enjoy\u2026<br/>- Cafe Patachou <br/>- Noodles &amp; Company <br/>- There is a good make your own burrito place in the mall<br/><br/>2. Money:<br/><br/>In terms of expenses, I suggest bringing a mini inflatable mattress and crashing on a hotel room floor. Usually roommates won\u2019t charge you an even split but a reduced amount. And I find this a better option than staying far away.<br/><br/>3. Heat:<br/><br/>This is extremely variable but you don\u2019t have to spend too much time outside. You can even use the walk ways between the convention center and hotels to get to many places. <br/><br/>4. Commercial Emphasis<br/><br/>The buy emphasis is minimal at Games on Demand and the Embassy Suites or pretty much anywhere outside of the dealer room. You can fill your schedule with out of print or very old games that no one is even selling at the con. The boardgame ballrooms are also fantastic as they have plenty of open tables and games you can try and play for free. They sometimes even have people that will teach you the rules and give you free food! The Rio Grande room last year even had a veggie buffet! <br/><br/>5. Gaming<br/><br/>I\u2019d love for us to develop a backchannel for playing easy pickup games. It\u2019s already very easy between Games on Demand and the Embassy Suites. Maybe using twitter, texting, a mobile wiki, or ?<br/><br/>My understanding is there will be way less of an indie presence in the dealer room. No Pirate Jenny, possibly no Forge Booth, no Play Collective, and no Ashcan Front. It will likely be Design Matters (which is wonderful but small) and IPR. Even more of a reasons to focus on Games on Demand and backchannels. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I would add up the expenses in terms of time and money and explore all options. If I had to choose between Gencon or going to several small indie cons (Go Play Northwest, Camp Nerdly, Dreamation, Jiffycon) I would go to 3-4 indie cons instead. That said, due to travel, Gencon can be cheaper (and uses less vacation) although going to several small indie cons will give you more personal face time with people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258037/#Comment_258037" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T07:18:31+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  7:18AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>No Pirate Jenny, possibly no Forge Booth, no Play Collective, and no Ashcan Front.

If I had not had that prophetic zeal I doubt I would ever have started going, which would have been a mistake for me. <br/><br/>Gen Con always has very high quality games in all the genres of play. Some of the best role playing I've ever done I did at Gen Con. That alone makes it worthwhile to me. I wish I could play now but I'm commercially driven anymore.<br/><br/>As to the food situation. Convention Hall food is always bad. I always leave the hall to eat. Vegetables make me feel good so I get then at every meal. The Food Court in the mall has veggies and steak places always have salads.<br/><br/>Then comes the cost. For me, anymore, Gen Con is a profit making trip because I'm selling stuff at my booth and keeping expenses real low because I commute in to the con from Bloomington (an hour south of Indy). When I paid for a hotel I shared space with friends which made it less costly but it was always a big cost. Gen Con is a spectacle and they cost. I think it is the major trip for many people. If it isn't for you then maybe don't go. It will always be costly. <br/><br/>All in all  I love Gen Con and look forward to attending for many years to come. I anticipate a time in the future when I get out of the commercial side and get to play again. That will be nice. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258042/#Comment_258042" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T07:44:09+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  7:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a great time at GenCon.

A few years ago I was covering Origins for the newspaper and was absolutely miserable the whole time. Turns out I had screwed up some of my meds right before the weekend and was basically going through depression/withdrawl. I have to be real careful now to make sure I'm taking care of myself both at the convention and in the days leading up to it, otherwise it becomes a struggle and I just feel sick.<br/><br/>I think most everyone has a point in saying it is all about knowing what you are wanting out of the convention and then going for that thing while you are there. Doesn't mean you have to ignore stuff, but wandering with purpose is better than wandering without.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont" title="chaldfont"><img alt="chaldfont" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont">chaldfont</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258718/#Comment_258718" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T09:40:28+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  9:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as food, downtown Indy has a ton of variety, just not right over by the convention center.

Even so, the best stuff in town isn't downtown, it's in Broad Ripple or the suburbs.<br/><br/>Some of my favorites are Yats, India Garden, Barcelona Tapas, and the City Market.
