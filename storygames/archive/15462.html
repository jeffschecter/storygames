I'm taking the lead on organizing the event for Gen Con, and I'd like to gather any additional feedback or suggestions based on previous years.<br/><br/>When I was asked by Gen Con to better explain the concept of Games on Demand, here's what I said:\n<blockquote><br/><b>What are the goals?</b><br/>To my mind, the event serves two main purposes: 1) creating an opportunity for attendees and volunteers to play new and unusual games, often with the designers, and have fun; 2) serving as a "long-demo" space for the booths and publishers selling the books, giving them a way to expose people to their games.<br/><br/><b>Who\u2019s in charge?</b><br/>Games on Demand doesn't belong to a specific company, and is more of a community social event. It is a volunteer-run operation with close ties to the publishers and vendors (such as IPR, Pelgrane, Design Matters and others) that sell the games at the show. Vendors (such as IPR) have in the past supplied the event with badges, materials, and discount coupons, and many individuals and publishers have invested their time and energy to make it happen each year.<br/><br/><b>Which games are on demand, exactly?</b><br/>This definition has always been shaky at best. Whether you call them "indie", "story" or "small press" games, it means roughly the same thing- small games that often feature unusual mechanics or ideas, from creators and publishers who are mostly unknown in the broader industry. To be fair, most of the games we're talking about come out of a specific community, but the event is by no means limited to people we know. We had some people running their independent games this year who were certainly new to the community, which was both weird and great.<br/><br/></blockquote>\n I have a few specific goals for this thread:<br/><br/>1) If you've helped organize or run the event in years past, and would like to work with me to organize things a bit better, please chime in or drop me a line directly. I'm currently in talks with the Gen Con staff about plans for 2012 and I'd like a small team of advisers to help me sort that out (between now and January).<br/><br/>2) If you've run Games on Demand at another show (Origins, PAX, etc.), and would like to do it again, I'd be interested in coordinating our planning. Drop me a line or jump into this thread with your ideas.<br/><br/>3) If you have any specific feedback on the event, including what we should repeat from last year and ways we can improve, shout it out. One thing we have discussed is putting on a mix of scheduled events alongside the usual Games on Demand in generally the same area. Thoughts on that would be welcome.<br/><br/>4) If you have ideas about how to better define the event, it's goals, or the concept of which games we're talking about- in terms the general public will understand- I'd like to hear them. <br/><br/>NOTE: I'm not particularly interested in re-hashing old arguments about what "Indie" means or doesn't mean. Let's keep that talk to a minimum. <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350670/#Comment_350670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T09:17:41+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  9:17AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If Terry and I can make it to Gen Con, we plan on spending most of our time running games at Games of Demand.<br/><br/>I'll spend some time thinking about the above questions and get back to you if something fruitful develops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350737/#Comment_350737" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T20:03:43+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  8:03PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would definitely love to help.

And then you either leave money in a box or track down the creator and pay them directly.  It's a bit harder at more commercial conventions that have their own rules about sales, but my sense is that people often sell out of backpacks on an individual basis.  It's just harder to have an open sales venue distinct from the convention, because we'd likely get reported and then be in trouble with the convention staff that we want to work closely with in the future.  Often, if you have a connection with a game store that's selling at the convention, you can get them to carry your games for you, even just temporarily, as long as they have shelf space or a place near the register to put them.<br/><br/>Unless something crazy happens with my job, I'll be at PAX Prime this year and will be glad to help out however I can.  Also, I have the poster files from the black-and-white poster we used for PAX, based on the color poster from GenCon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351001/#Comment_351001" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T06:16:06+00:00" title="December  9, 2011  6:16AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I doubt we can do a sales table at Gen Con, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

Games increase sales and sales increase games played, so it's a positively reinforcing feedback cycle.  This can either be in a special zone or by simply having play space closer to the dealer's hall.  <br/><br/>If we can find a way to have fewer booths (therefore fewer people stuck manning them at any time and lower costs), I think that we could increase the fun quotient at least 20%.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351076/#Comment_351076" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T02:35:19+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  2:35AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect it is early but do we have a list of games coming out next Gen Con?<br/><br/>Terry and I can currently run pickup games of Kagematsu, Grey Ranks, Fiasco, Mouse Guard, Trail of Cthulhu, Cthulhu Dark, Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, Dread, Lady Blackbird, The Mountain Witch, My Life With Master, Smallville, Leverage, Action Castle, and many more. But many of these games may not be for sale at IPR or at Gen Con at all. <br/><br/>Does that matter?

Lets coordinate for sure. I really like the idea of there being a WAY that we all do this at Gencon and Origins, and elsewhere if people are interested. I think a cool way might be, everybody come willing to play, but also to run a game. This works at my home con, and it worked well recently at Burning Con too. Is working up a schedule ahead of time counter to the Demand idea? Or can there somehow be a loose schedule (we did this at Origins a bit, by gathering what GM's were willing to run ahead of time and posting it up).<br/><br/>I organized with Jim Crocker and Evan Torner at Origins last year, with Jim doing a lot of the heavy lifting by talking with a GAMA rep that he had a relationship with (thanks Jim!). Nick Wedig, Jason Morningstar, Kat Jones and a bunch of other people were eager and willing to run things in that space last year as well, and it went awesomely! <br/><br/>I think really it's just a matter of more streamlined organization and communication. It'd be great to have like, an email discussion going with everyone interested in organizing. Maybe we can coordinate on gmail or google+? I see there's talk already on google+, but maybe email might be a better forum for serious, concentrated discussion? I find when people randomly post on here or social networking forums, there's a lot of maybes and not a whole lot of commitment. I think commitment is key in getting a good event!

The plan as it stands is to make some modest changes from last year and doing what we can improve the event for everyone involved. <br/><br/>Right now we should be getting a 12 table room in the Convention Center, probably on the upper floor overlooking the Exhibitor hall (though the details are still to be worked out). That gives us twice the space we had last year, in a more central location. I don't think we'll actually be able to double attendance and GMs, so we'll split the space into both standard Games on Demand open gaming and scheduled games, taking tickets for both as we did last year (1 specific or generic ticket / 2 hour slot).<br/><br/>If you're interested in running scheduled games for the event, touch base with me before trying to enter it yourself. Likewise, if you want to volunteer to GM open games or help facilitate GoD, let me know. Volunteers and GMs who put in enough hours will get comped badges (and maybe a place to sleep). I'll be working out the scheduling details more as we get closer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355986/#Comment_355986" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T19:38:03+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  7:38PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>twice the space we had last year, in a more central location</blockquote>\nSounds like more than a modest change!

Derek asked me if we'd want to stay open later (from 10pm - 12am for example) and I said my only concern was covering the time and being able to take tickets. <br/><br/>In general, I'd like to make sure our actual attendance is a large percentage of what we anticipate it will be. Empty seats during our event hours make it look less successful on paper, giving us less leverage for space, etc. That said, if we have the interest and volunteers, we can make the hours whatever we like. <br/><br/>I should also note that we won't have to lock up the room at night, so people can stick around after 10pm and keep playing if they aren't drawn elsewhere in pursuit of booze.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
