It was way cool but for some reason I hit a overwhelmed-wall and read no more.  I am going to look over the info though.<br/><br/>Paul, that's pretty much the spirit but with multiple artists!!  Did it every go off?  What was Ed's reaction to the idea?<br/><br/>George, I am hesitant (although open to ideas).  Initially I would say yes because the idea was that most feel that B&amp;Ws take less time.  I have an idea.  How about if the restriction were "do four pieces that you would charge $20 each for." I think that would set up the playing field in the way that I intended (based on "the angry industry" thread).<br/><br/>Remi, so here is the goal.  How much art can an artist produce in an hour's time, assuming $20 an hour is a rate an artist can live with.  It was suggested that art with restrictions would take more time than art the artist was inspired to illustrate from her their own creative juices.  Bu I see your point and your input is exactly what I needed.  Some ingredients shouldn't be too much harder to work with and would be more like what would be expected of them on a commision (although less restrictive).<br/><br/>I could definately come up with some ingredients.  I think soliciting artists is a great idea.  Do any of the artist folks have any suggestions for a good venue to cross-post such a contest?  <br/><br/>Just so we're clear I would not do this until the beginning of the year after the holiday madness settles down.  So we have some time to hash out the details.<br/><br/>Joe, without needing specifics about past contests, anyone that has some suggestions on do's and don't of this sort of this would be very helpful.<br/><br/>Also I would need a person to manage the liscense specifics.  I am rather ignorant of the multitude of liscenses out there and to be honest I don't think it would be wise to learn them while organizing it.  Anyone willing to step up to the plate to discuss and make a decision how we can come up with a liscensing structure most of us are happy with?<br/><br/>Thanks for your input,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111991/#Comment_111991" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T10:56:39+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 10:56AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a spitball on the wall... why even have a "contest," <i>per se</i>? Why not, instead, make it a sort of "match-up" or "square dance" or "secret-artist-Santa" thing?<br/><br/>Basically, any artist who wants to play submits... whatever: color or not, done in an hour or in a week, whatever. Then, each submission set is randomly allocated to a designer who expresses interest. ...And there's the rub, I guess: we'd want designers to be committed to producing a salable game (oh, god, don't make me define that, in the harsh glare of the angry industry thread) because the artists' compensation would be exposure in that game. Maybe, then, we'd want "design Teams" to drive projects home...?<br/><br/>Hmmm... or maybe just collect and then display/post all the sets of art and have any and all interested designers propose game pitches, associated with one (or more, if possible aesthetically) sets? Then, each artist would decide which of the proposed project to which to attach their art. The drawback there is that some artists might not have any proposals, which would be disappointing (but, hey! that's incentive to really make evocative, inspiring art!). That way, an artist who is propositioned for a project has a pretty good chance of being seen in said product, as the winning designers will want to run with their ideas (presumably); and if they drop the ball after X months, the artist can just go down the list of losing proposals, seeking a designer who will finish a project.<br/><br/>Yeah... I like that: everyone's reward is exposure, each artist gets to choose the "best" game for his or her art, and each designer gets to choose the "best" art for his or her game/product (might be a setting book or whatever).<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112049/#Comment_112049" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T12:44:45+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 12:44PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'd be interested in this, as an artist, though I'll have to see what sort of solid form the contest takes before I make a firm decision. <br/><br/>I think it might be prudent to find out how many designers are definitely interested before going on an artist recruitment drive. While multiple designers could conceivably work with one artist, I can't see multiple artists working with one designer. Basically there should never be more designers than artists involved here or the artists are wasting their time.<br/><br/>I agree with Remi that some strictures should exist for the artists so you don't get complete randomness. I recall seeing another contest here involving a set of keywords that the designers had to pick and choose from. Seems like that'd work in this case as well.<br/><br/>Once the rules are set in stone I could make a post about it on a smallish webcomic forum I call home, and see if there's any interest there. Posting to a gigantor community might see you a bit overwhelmed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112060/#Comment_112060" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T13:04:21+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  1:04PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things I think might be good:<br/>1.

I think avoiding the insane publishing argument is the best tack to take. Asking someone to participate in something fun for free isn't immoral.<br/><br/>2. I agree with Bent that there should be enough designers interested that each artist's work will be guaranteed to be used.<br/><br/>3. I think it would be fun if the artist's participation were in two stages. The first would be the initial 1 or 2 illustrations to kickstart the design process, but perhaps as the design comes along, the artist could do 1 or 2 more illustrations at the request of, or working with, the designer? I see this having two nice outcomes:\n<ol>\n<li>A designer could learn a little bit about art directing, feeling out what an artist's strengths are and using those skills to their fullest. Even if the artist is working in a style that may not be the designer's first choice.</li>\n<li>The flow of information should be both ways, with the artist perhaps acting as a sounding board for the designers ideas of how art can influence the game. Ideally this would give the artist some insight into the design process, and the demands of content.</li>\n</ol>\nAnyway, those are my ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112070/#Comment_112070" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T13:20:55+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  1:20PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that each product should be available for free, but I don't think you should also limit people from developing something into a commercial enterprise as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112076/#Comment_112076" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T13:26:37+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  1:26PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>2. I agree with Bent that there should be enough designers interested that each artist's work will be guaranteed to be used.</blockquote>\nThat's utterly irrelevant, if you take the approach I describe above.<br/><br/>1) X artists put up whatever they are willing to give away, for self-promotion, in whatever style (color, BW, sketch, paint) or base 2D medium (scanned art, CGI, rendered).<br/>2) Y designers come up with pitches--of any length and detail level--and associate them with a given artist's set of work. Basically, the designers "apply" to be the one given rights to use the art.<br/><br/># Artists &lt; # Designers doesn't matter: only one designer (or team) per artists submission will win rights to use it.<br/>As I noted above, # Artists &gt; # Designers could lead to disappointed artists, unless some designers submit pitches to more than one artist to make up the difference.<br/><br/>The whole point being that everyone is opt-in, the best artists will have their pick of designs, and the best designers will have awesome art as the very seed of a new game. And players get X new free games (assuming no artists bail out, after seeing all pitches for their art). Win, win, win.<br/><br/>Give it some serious thought. There's no prize with which to deal (that's built-in: exposure); you don't really need an organizer (artists can just post threads with their art, designers post pitches in those threads); the only "judges" are the artists, the only thing "judged" is willing submissions; and the outcome is resolved individually, to each artist's (and, thus, designer's) tastes. Heck, it needn't even be a timed or "scheduled" thing: as artists put together packages, they can post them and then give some kind of time limit during which designers must post pitches... hell, or not, if they're willing to sit on their art indefinitely, awaiting an inspired designer. This "contest" could instead become a "practice."<br/><br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JenniferRodgers" title="JenniferRodgers"><img alt="JenniferRodgers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/847/n8DBFAZ4ANH6I.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JenniferRodgers">JenniferRodgers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112078/#Comment_112078" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T13:28:10+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  1:28PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don, if submitting already existing stuff ends up being ok, I'd be happy to participate.

Yes.  Exposure?  I think that participating is the exposure angle.  The goal is to get artists to flex their creative muscles and produce art that will be evocative of a cool game.  Then designers to look deep into that art and find the essence of CHAOLAUZUI.  I don't know that I want to make it completely random because honestly I want designers to be inspired and go with the inspiration, on the other hand I want to make certain all artists get designers using their stuff.<br/><br/>What I would really like to see out of this is some cool ashcans that inspire playtesting and actual products so that everyone gets rewarded for their efforts.  I do believe in the free market, though, so I feel that the "better" artists and designers will rise to the top and produce superior product on budget.  Although I love the sentiment that art should be expressive and edgy I am uncertain that it's what is best for the hobby.  I think that's part of the idea here.  Sure the character sheet that was a big arrow to death was edgy and even evocative but I felt it probably was lacking in the spirit of the contest (or at least what I read into the spirit of the contest).  <br/><br/>Jenn, I have no problem with previsouly done art (how would we know) as long as it's representative of a commisioned piece you would produce for someone for $20 (without the consideration that you've already complete it).<br/><br/>I am torn between David's perspective and a few others.  On one hand a purely competive environment where the artists vie for designers then designers compete for the best game version of that art leaves me a little flat.  Hmmm, maybe I could make a game out of it.  Maybe there is a minor and simple bidding process where you would bid on multiple artists for your game design and then they would be distributed appropriately so that everyone got someone.

For what it's worth, Remi, I totally agree with your points 1 (all free, for all) and 3 (once matched, artists and designers work on as much additional art as the artist is willing to give).\n<blockquote>1) Exposure isn't a prize.</blockquote>\nUh... I guess we can't get into a "uh-huh!", "nu-uh!" debate; but as a (former) graphic artists, I can promise you that four ~$20 pieces (call it $100) is a pittance for anyone who doesn't need or wouldn't benefit from exposure (i.e. any popular or professional artists). That sum would hire me for less than two hours. Unless were talking about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xddN-ysrFlk" rel="nofollow">Denny Dent</a></span>, not many high-quality artists can even finish one decent color piece in less than two hours, let alone four or more pieces (i.e. enough to make more than a token impact on an RPG book).<br/><br/>Of course, I am now squarely in the cross-hairs of folks whose techniques or styles allow them to produce at a much higher rate, who are well-exposed, or who would be doing this to help *designers* rather than themselves: good on 'em, I say. They are a valuable minority.<br/><br/>But that brings me to a significant question: What's the aim or agenda of this endeavor? I felt the opt-in-submission + designer-application process made a very balanced endeavor which ultimately would maximally serve the interests of matched artists and designers; what's the point of a "competition" which will end up with winners and losers (unless SG has some alt-definition for competition that I do not yet know)?\n<blockquote>2) I'm uncomfortable making this into choosing sides for dodgeball, but with people's art. Asking people to contribute work should result in a designer at least attempting to use that work.</blockquote>\nOk, I can say this is a bit absurd. I could do a few (very amateurish) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://davidartman.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=33" rel="nofollow">comic style drawings</a></span> and be somehow guaranteed that a designer submits a work to me? That's definitely not a competition; it's a stroke-fest, with the designers (mostly) as the gripping hand.\n<blockquote>3) This is a personal thing, but I think it would be very healthy if there were a greater breadth of styles and techniques beyond the ones generally on display in RPGs. I believe your suggestion would result in those artists who cleave most closely to the accepted paradigm of RPG art would be the ones with the most offers, with quirkier or more personal work being ignored.</blockquote>\nAgain, I gotta say absurd, particularly in light of the SG/indie scene. If we ran this on RPG.net, sure, the "cut abs and big tits" art would be raise a ruckus.<br/><br/>But in this forum, I'd expect any and all artists to be considered, and those with evocative styles will... uh, evoke interest, period. In fact, I am surprised that you'd show so little faith in this scene, to presume that folks here (and folks drawn here, say, from The Forge) would be dismissive of quality art just because it didn't fit some "RPG paradigm." I seriously doubt it, though I don't know most folks here except by their work and posted (or implied) ideologies.\n<blockquote>I would prefer to give the designers at least a small opportunity to stretch aesthetically, rather than just pick over whatever piece most fits their preconceptions of 'good art'.</blockquote>\nAll the more reason to open up the format of the endeavor to an opt-in, take-applications style, rather than run some competition where some (most?) of the artists will be sent packing ("not RPG style") or some (most?) of the designers are press-ganged into wrapping a game around art they don't particularly dig.<br/>...continued...

The former trusts some presumably knowledgeable authority to thrust two folks together to make a match-up, and it hopes that the match-up becomes wonderful and productive. Conversely, speed-dating places a "buffet" of options before people who self-select to be judged (and judge), and it lets the participants' have (mutual) authority to get together or not.<br/><br/>Which practice would we rather endorse?<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112384/#Comment_112384" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T11:27:15+00:00" title="December  6, 2007 11:27AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I am in and would love to work with you all on this <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I will still want someone willing to handle the IP protection and liscence discussions.

With a few click on the CC site, and we get:<br/><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" rel="license nofollow"><br/><img alt="Creative Commons License" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/88x31.png"/><br/></a>This work is licensed under a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" rel="license nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License</a></span>.<br/>Choose "Share Alike," if the game is suited to hacking (setting, genre, or mechanics); otherwise, lock it down with "Non-Derivative," and it's as inviolate as pirates are willing to let it be.<br/><br/>Although... with my proposed process (sorry! I'm NOT harping, just pointing out) this wouldn't have to be an aspect of the endeavor at all: let each match-up decide for themselves, as they develop. Some might figure, "eh, the exposure is enough" while others might think, "You know, this game ROCKS; let's get this on Lulu and split the profits!" In short, once you remove some external authority, organization, or judge, then each match-up can work out amongst themselves how they'd like to proceed. ...Although it would be smart for artists and designers, during the submit/apply process, to give some indication of personal preference (ex: "Here's my art, and I am hoping for a commercial endeavor" or "Here's a great game idea I had for your art, but I'd really like to be sure it's a free release").<br/><br/>Also, I presume the 14 day time for designers to propose games only expects an "executive overview" or "high concept," right? Because I could barely get out an outline in two weeks, for any kind of "complete" game idea I'd have.<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112411/#Comment_112411" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T12:53:31+00:00" title="December  6, 2007 12:53PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            14 days seems like a pretty complete game.  For my secret santa I'm designing an RPG just for them (what little I know of them) along with some other stuff.  I banged out the character creation this afternoon.  Saturday it should be done.  Sure, it won't be playtested yet but it will be done and about 4 to 5 pages of a complete game.  Everyone is different and there will be restraints on the design process similar to the artist restraints.  I like budget being a part of the process.<br/><br/>Those who have run other contest before what was your experience like, briefly.<br/><br/>BTW Jason my hope is that designers take advantage of the Dreamation weekend to get some playtesting done.

And even for the ones who do, it's pretty low rates for the kind of thing that would have serious creative investment put into it (as opposed to the generic art-to-spec work that pays those rates). Bare minimum "industry standard" doesn't seem like where you would want to be for this endeavor. Why cripple the project by hobbling the artists?<br/><br/>And again I ask you... Why restrict the artists at all? Are you going to put a time limit on the designer too? Restrict them to 4 hours of writing, or "a game you'd sell for $100?" <br/><br/>This doesn't make sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112594/#Comment_112594" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T20:15:52+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  8:15PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that the $20 limit is kind of mysterious.

There are a lot of designers and artists out there, the excited side can find someone else to finish the job.

This consists of one game designer, one artists, and one artist / game designer.<br/><br/>2) Come up with art inspirations, if necessary. I'm thinking a game chef style thing, but that'd be up to the TRIUMVIRATE. Artists to 3-6 pieces based on those inspirations over a two week period.<br/><br/>3) Post all art sets. Designers may choose a set of design for it. Like game chef, we may see people choosing multiple sets for one game, which is either whatever or a total disqualification. I *strongly doubt* that any art set will go unchosen. However, if this happens, that's not a total fail for the artist (see below.)<br/><br/>4) Post all the games. Artists may, if they wish, do 1-2 pieces inspired by a game.<br/><br/>5) The TRIUMVIRATE convenes to JUDGE the material. Winners are chosen in the categories of Best Art, Best Game, and Best Combination of Art and Game. Even art w/o a game can win in Best Art.<br/><br/>6) The winners are congratulated.<br/><br/>7) People go on to make awesome games with awesome art.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>P.S. I'd rather not be a member of the TRIUMVIRATE, because I want to participate and be JUDGED. But, you know, if it comes down to that, I'm 1/3rd right away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112742/#Comment_112742" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T10:09:07+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 10:09AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remi, I guess what's got me stuck is that there needs to be payment exchange at all. If it's presumed that the designers are going to be paying publishing fees, I don't see why they should be paying an artist for work that was produced without strictures or editing. I don't see why this can't be a fun little jam between two creative parties, rather than a serious publishing endeavour. Maybe the proceeds just go to charity, like Drowning and Falling?<br/><br/>I don't want to insult my freelancer brethren, because I realise how contentious the idea of doing art for free can be when you're a professional trying to eke by, but if it's that bothersome a concept, maybe just skip the contest? That said, it's not hard to dial down the amount of effort one puts into a piece of art to suit the project at hand. I can produce four drawings that I think would fit the bill in a few hours, with modest effort, and I wouldn't feel cheated for doing it for free. The reward would be the collaboration.<br/><br/>That's my take anyhow. I may be alone in the wilderness here, but that's cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112743/#Comment_112743" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T10:10:45+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 10:10AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The money thing is a little confusing, Don, and I hope you'll either clarify or just drop it.
