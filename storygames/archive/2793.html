Here's a thought about using it in QIN (crossposted at rpgnet):</p>\n<p>All characters have a River. Inside it are up to five pools in a row. The first pool is its Head and the last is its Mouth. Each pool is big enough for one die. In the middle of the table is a big pool called the Sea; it can fit an unlimited number of dice.</p>\n<p>When you roll doubles, you can take the critical success, or you can take a standard roll of the rolled value and float one of the dice, showing its value, in your River. It goes into the Head pool and causes any other dice to flow Mouthward. If there's a die in the Mouth already, it flows into the Sea.</p>\n<p>When you make any roll, you can take the die closest to your Mouth, or one in the Sea, and flow it into the roll, after you roll it, and calculate the result of your roll based on your River die and one of the other two. You <em>are</em> allowed to make a double this way, but you're not allowed to flow into a roll and float out of the same.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63487/#Comment_63487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T07:45:06+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  7:45AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is hawt.<br/><br/>I feel like with the flow here, there should be something about stealing from another's river but I'm grasping at a feeling there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63488/#Comment_63488" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T07:50:54+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  7:50AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

A quick rundown:</p>\n<p>An action in WotG consists of rolling some number (usually &lt;= 7) d10s. You get results from matching dice. This generates a two-digit number of the form XY, where X is the number of matched dice and Y is their value (10 reads as 0 but it gets you a second kind of currency). Once you have selected your result (and if at least a pair exists in the roll, I think you are <em>required</em> to select at least a pair as your result (not sure about this)), you may 'float' sets of dice into the River. After you float, you may flow dice out of the River into your roll. (I might have bunged up the order of float and flow there. It's specific and you're not allowed to do it out of order.) This will for example allow you to take a roll like 1 2 4 4 5 7 7 and select the 27, and then if you've got 27 in your River, you can turn it into a 47 by flowing those dice. At some point in this sequence, you're also allowed to 'wash' the River, clearing away and discarding all the dice in it.</p>\n<p>Basically it's a kind of buffer for 'excess' good rolls. The main benefit of being an experienced character in WotG is having a larger River to work with, which interacts with large dice pools to give you the option of either consistent middling effectiveness or dramatic effectiveness spikes.</p>\n<p>I introduced the concept of the Sea because WotG's 'wash' was kind of inelegant to me, and I like the subtle side effects that it causes; large numbers of people with small Rivers will flood the Sea with diverse dice that then make <em>everyone</em> more effective around them! I think maybe floating should be mandatory under this system, so that this actually occurs ever.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63761/#Comment_63761" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T02:03:24+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  2:03AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Judd, I imagine you could have a little, um, boat.</p>\n<p>Say that you own X boats. When you float a die, you can put it on your boat. This doesn't do anything if you end up using it before it gets to the Sea, but if it does, and someone else uses it, then they have to take your boat, and the next die they float is put on your boat. Then, since it's your boat, you are able to steal it whenever you like just as if it's in your own River.</p>\n<p>You could even have different sorts of boats with different properties - like, the above boat is kind of mean to your enemies and a cool teamwork thing among your friends; you could also make it so your boat only goes to the Sea and prevents someone from taking your die until you give permission, at which point the boat returns to your dock, or maybe it's a trade boat and people have to pay for your die with some secondary currency.</p>\n<p>Aren't metaphors great?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63769/#Comment_63769" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T05:09:59+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  5:09AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the run-down Shreyas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
