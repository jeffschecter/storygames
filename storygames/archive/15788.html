A whole load of boardgames have some pretty dull subsystems: "move token on the score track", etc. They're typically fine and unobtrusive.<br/><br/>What you want to avoid are <i>tedious</i> subsystems. Not every mechanic needs to be fun or entertaining in itself -- but if they're not, they should stay out of the way.<br/><br/>Even more so, most really great boardgames aren't about entertaining mechanics at all. They're about solving problems in an interesting space. Don't confuse mechanics used to build that space with the space itself. The space is what is interesting, the mechanics are there to give you access to that space.<br/><br/>If those mechanics are tedious, don't work properly, or -- even worse -- are not needed to access the problem space in the first place, then yeah, the game is going to suck.<br/><br/>Games with entertaining mechanics are fun for a short time. Games with entertaining problem spaces are fun for a long time.\n<blockquote>Give players something to do when its not their turn</blockquote>\nBoth sort of games have their place.<br/><br/>One thing I <i>adore</i> are boardgames where you can just relax when it isn't your turn: you can chat with the rest of the players, etc. This works best when the rounds don't take too long, and when the situation doesn't change too drastically during a typical round -- so you don't need to take long to re-orient yourself.<br/><br/>Sure, games where you're "on" <i>all the time</i> are great too -- but not nearly as social.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358493/#Comment_358493" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T10:24:37+00:00" title="February  9, 2012 10:24AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nikodemus</cite><br/>One thing I<i>adore</i>are boardgames where you can just relax when it isn't your turn: you can chat with the rest of the players, etc. This works best when the rounds don't take too long, and when the situation doesn't change too drastically during a typical round -- so you don't need to take long to re-orient yourself.</blockquote>\nIn my experience, this is terrible, and it tends to drag the game out.  Maybe in something simple like Ticket to Ride where most turns you just pick up a card or two, and it's easy to watch other players do that while thinking of something else, but in anything with reasonable complexity you need to either be watching other players on their turns, or thinking of what you're going to be doing next.<br/><br/>Maybe I just have bad memories of really long Twilight Imperium games where people talk on the side, you come to their turn, and then they have to figure out what to do.  It's not a reorientation problem, it's that the game gave them something to do during other players' turns (i.e. plan theirs), and they didn't do it.<br/><br/>So "give players something to do when its not their turn" doesn't have to be something particularly active.  It can be planning, it can be giving suggestions (like in cooperative or semi-cooperative games), the ability to interrupt, or just making other players' turns interesting enough to watch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358512/#Comment_358512" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T12:29:30+00:00" title="February  9, 2012 12:29PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I understand what you mean by this, but it is hyperbole.

It doesn't take the focus of attention away from the parts of the game that are interesting. Similarly, rolling dice, drawing cards, and other simple gestures are so familiar and efficient that they have become automatic.</p>\n<p>By contrast, some games have non-interesting mechanics that are <em>also not automatic,</em> and this makes them a lot less fun - for instance, the otherwise excellent game <em>Power Grid</em> has an intricate, context-sensitive resource replenishment mechanic that doesn't involve any decision-making, takes a lot of time, happens every turn cycle, and requires you to look at a table basically every time. It's like someone flushed the toilet while you're taking a shower - a rude shock that interrupts the otherwise excellent flow of that game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358515/#Comment_358515" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T12:30:43+00:00" title="February  9, 2012 12:30PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Er - my point there was, "If you're going to make a mechanic that's not interesting, at least give it the properties that allow it to become automatic - minimize the number of steps and remove context-dependency so players can just do it without thinking about it."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358521/#Comment_358521" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T13:09:57+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  1:09PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2012 1:11PM by nikodemus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite>So "give players something to do when its not their turn" doesn't have to be something particularly active.

I'll chat with the guy who I haven't see in months. I'll put a kettle on.<br/><br/>If there's something to do all the time, fine, but if it takes so much focus that you can't speak with people at the same time... not so great. If there's enough air in the game that chitchat on top of it isn't a problem, much better.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that this doesn't really apply the first or maybe not even the second time I play. Then I'm engrossed in figuring out the game. It's when the basics have been learned that these things start to matter. I don't mind thinking about tactics, but ... there's a limit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358522/#Comment_358522" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T13:19:42+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  1:19PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2012 1:20PM by timonkey.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>By contrast, some games have non-interesting mechanics that are<em>also not automatic,</em>and this makes them a lot less fun - for instance, the otherwise excellent game<em>Power Grid</em>has an intricate, context-sensitive resource replenishment mechanic that doesn't involve any decision-making, takes a lot of time, happens every turn cycle, and requires you to look at a table basically every time. It's like someone flushed the toilet while you're taking a shower - a rude shock that interrupts the otherwise excellent flow of that game.</blockquote>\nI actually find that mechanic to be one of Power Grid's biggest strengths.  Not the actual physical replenishment obviously, but the strategic planning it encourages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358523/#Comment_358523" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T13:23:53+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  1:23PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nikodemus</cite><br/>If there's something to do all the time, fine, but if it takes so much focus that you can't speak with people at the same time... not so great.

Some like to chat about other things over the game, others don't, for others it depends on what game you're playing.  There's a type of heavy strategic game where I don't want much talk about non-game stuff, but I don't want it that way because we set it as a rule and people end up sitting quiet and bored, I want it that way because we're all so engrossed in the game we wouldn't consider talking about something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358524/#Comment_358524" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T13:28:22+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  1:28PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to add on to this:<br/><br/>"- Do not add a rule to take care of an unusual situation."<br/><br/>Fix, or remove, the elements of the game that create that unusual situation.

I find playing Battletech on the computer via MegaMek vastly inferior to the tabletop play, specifically because it calculates all the modifiers for me.  Sure, it follows all the same rules, but because I don't interface with them, I can't make the connections as well to the fact that I can't hit because my target is moving too much, since the computer hides it all.  If I don't actually have to physically implement with the resource resupply rules in Power Grid, I'm not going to understand them well enough to strategize based on them.  Maybe a "board game" on one of those big tablet computer tables would be a good space.  It can do it for you, but also very clearly show you what's going on similar to another person doing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
