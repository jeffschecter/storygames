We have a bunch of stuff, but if you or someone you know would like to make sure your zine or game is included, please get in touch with us (meow-&gt;babycastles_com).<br/><br/>Some particulars:<br/>- Our budget for this installation is exactly zero dollars, so if you're not going to be personally attending IndieCade East, don't look to send us something you want back.<br/>- Likewise, we're not going to print and assemble anything longer than a couple of pages, if at all.<br/>- Any zines or games that are sent for this exhibition WILL ultimately end up in a more permanent zine library where they can be accessed for free by the public. Probably somewhere in Brooklyn.<br/>- If you live in the New York area, or will be attending IndieCade East, you can loan stuff for the duration of the show and pick it up when it's over. But remember that the public will have had free access to it for 3 days, so some wear is to be expected, and we can't be responsible if somebody slips it under their coat and walks away with it forever (sorry).<br/>- There will be no official games-on-demand-type folks to run games (although if it were to happen spontaneously, that's fine).<br/>- You can say you've had your work featured at the Museum of the Moving Image, a major New York institution, as part of IndieCade East.<br/><br/>If that all sounds good to you, get in touch!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427015/#Comment_427015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-11T12:08:58+00:00" title="January 11, 2014 12:08PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2014 12:10PM by Emily_Care.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds great.
