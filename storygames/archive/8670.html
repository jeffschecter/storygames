The dragon has been awakened, and the town is in danger.<br/><br/>This game is a very simple 1 round <a href="http://www.hamsterpress.net/news/list" rel="nofollow">Engle Matrix Game</a>. This post will explain the situation in Thunderfast. Post 2 explains how we\u2019ll use the Engle Matrix Game rules for this challenge. Post 3 is a list of characters you can choose from to complete the challenge. The goal of the challenge is to slay the dragon. My goal in posing this is to try out the suitability of Engle Matrix Games for resolving heroic fantasy challenges.<br/><br/>Thunderfast is a large town in the mountains on the border of a fantasy-Europe kingdom. It has the standard amenities and services, including an inn, blacksmith, temple (complete with resident healer), a small wizard\u2019s guild, and militia. The town is of primarily wood construction, behind a stout stockade, which is sufficient to deter the occasional brigands or goblin raiding party. The townsfolk mine coal from the hills and chop wood from the forests. Beyond Thunderfast is monster-filled wilderness. <br/><br/>Nearby Thunderfast peak is known to harbor a dragon\u2019s lair, but until recently the dragon had been sleeping for centuries. Some greedy miners started exploiting rich mineral veins on its slopes. Their digging opened the Labyrinth and awoke the Dragon, who flew out to Thunderfast to make his ultimatum: \u201cDeliver all your gold unto me in seven days, or I will burn Thunderfast to the ground.\u201d The people are terrified, and aren\u2019t even sure they have enough gold to satisfy the dragon. They\u2019ve offered the town treasury and their undying gratitude to any hero that can slay the dragon.<br/><br/>Thunderfast peak is a low, wooded mountain with a deep volcanic crater at its peak. The dragon lives in a natural cave at the bottom of the crater. The cave comprises several chambers, worn smooth by the Dragon\u2019s belly. The wrym itself sleeps (they say) atop a heap of coins, gems, and treasure from vanished kingdoms deep in the cave. <br/><br/> There are two barriers to approaching the cave: The crater\u2019s sides are loose skree slopes with little cover, allowing the dragon to easily detect approaching invaders. Beneath the cave is a treacherous labyrinth of stone and ice filled with pitfalls and winding passages.  <br/><br/>The dragon is of enormous size, far stronger than any mortal and darkly cunning. It is greedy, vain, and cruel, and looks scorns all bipedal life. It can breathe gouts of magical flame. Its senses are as sharp as the keenest of men and its will is like iron. It has claws that can cut through steel and scales as hard as chainmail. A normal person cannot hope to defeat the dragon in an even fight. The whole town militia might, if it got very, very lucky. Even a hero would stand a less than even chance. To slay it will take more than walking up to it and whacking it in the head with a sword.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191746/#Comment_191746" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T19:18:37+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  7:18PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2009 8:26AM by tony_dowler.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To complete this challenge, choose a character (they are listed in the next post), then make an argument. An argument is a description of events and can include the actions your character takes, the consequences of those actions, the actions others take, their consequences, random events, and facts about the world. The referee (me), will rate the likelihood of your argument taking place on the following scale:\n<ul><li>Can\u2019t miss: roll 6 6\u2019s in a row to fail</li>\n<li>Really likely: roll 2-6 in 6 to happen</li>\n<li>Pretty likely: roll 3-6 in 6 to happen</li>\n<li>Okay: roll 4-6 in 6 to happen</li>\n<li>Pretty unlikely: roll 5-6 in 6 to happen</li>\n<li>Really unlikely: roll a 6 in 6 to happen</li>\n<li>Impossible: roll 6 1\u2019s in a row to happen</li>\n<li>Then I\u2019ll roll the dice, and tell you if your argument occurs.</li></ul>\nAn argument will be rated as more likely if:\n<ul><li>It\u2019s supported by facts already established in the situation</li>\n<li>It\u2019s reasonable in the context of the fiction</li>\n<li>It explains how barriers are bypassed</li></ul>\nAn argument will be rates as less likely if:\n<ul><li>It contradicts facts established in the situation</li>\n<li>It\u2019s unreasonable in the context of the fiction</li>\n<li>It ignores barriers in the way </li></ul>\nYour first argument will receive a default rating of pretty likely.<br/><br/>YOU GET TWO ARGUMENTS FOR THIS CHALLENGE. Your first argument regards how your character prepares to slay the dragon, and can include events up to, but not beyond, encountering the dragon. It can\u2019t include actually slaying the dragon. After the first set of arguments are judged, I\u2019ll make a new thread for the second set.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll close this challenge after a few days, or when I get as many challengers as I think I can handle.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> fixed a typo<br/><br/><b>Update:</b> In the interest of keeping the challenge moving even if your argument fails, I'll propose a counter-argument. This is what happens if you're argument fails. It basically describes what happens when your argument fails at its' weakest point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191747/#Comment_191747" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T19:20:11+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  7:20PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Choose one of these characters (and give them a name). Multiple people may choose the same character. Then make your first argument in a post.<br/><br/>For extra fun, don't read anyone else's post until after you make your own!<br/><br/>Character 1: The Barbarian Warrior<br/>A wanderer of the wastes beyond civilization, the barbarian has fought and defeated many foes. Her strength, courage, endurance, and fighting prowess are unsurpassed by mortals. The barbarian is not subtle, but neither is she any fool. She fights for glory and to discover if there is any foe who can defeat her. All she owns are the clothes on his back and her great sword.<br/><br/>Character 2: The Itinerant Wizard<br/>The Wizard has wandered a century amassing forgotten lore and arcane knowledge. Though weak of body, his intellect is formidable and he is deeply learned on every subject. He can work magic. Some of the most difficult magical feats he has ever performed include: producing a tower of flame from his palm, conjuring an iron anaconda to fight for him, and swaying a crowd to his will.<br/><br/>Character 3: The Dark Elf Assassin<br/>Universally feared and mistrusted, the Assassin still has a reputation for delivering on every contract. She is lightning quick, dangerously, cunning, patient, and determined. She has trained endlessly with her bow, and rarely misses any humanly possible shot. A face-to-face battle against an armed opponent doesn\u2019t favor her light frame, so she prefers to strike from the shadows, a technique she has perfected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191752/#Comment_191752" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T20:01:21+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  8:01PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 8:02PM by Willow.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't understand those die mechanics.<br/><br/>Can you explain what "roll 2-6 in 6" means, and how very likely and really likely differ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191756/#Comment_191756" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T20:12:36+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  8:12PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 8:13PM by Piers.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Irimitas the wizard stroked his chin thoughtfully as he listened to the townsfolk\u2019s situation.  <br/><br/>\u201cYes, I can help you, but my plan is dangerous and I cannot be sure that I will succeed.  Listen, this is what you must do...\u201d<br/><br/>1. I will need the mountain folk, miners, and the blacksmith to aid me.  We must take timber, coal and a series of iron devices built by the blacksmith according to my specifications on our mission to the peak, as well as ropes, planks, and climbing gear.  In addition, I will need the wizards to prepare wizard\u2019s fire according to instructions I will leave with them.<br/><br/>2. Those who remain in the town must be prepared for the possibility that the attempt to kill the dragon will not succeed.  The women, children, and any other non-combantants must be hidden, scattered through the forests, and only the militia will remain in the town to offer up the treasure and to defend it as a last resort.  <br/><br/>3.  While the townsfolk ready themselves, I will make a first reconnaissance of the labyrinth beneath the peak.  It is here that I will begin the first of magics that are necessary to the plan\u2014magic directed not at the dragon but at those who will accompany me.<br/><br/>4.  Four days before the dragon\u2019s return we will enter the labyrinth.  With the aid of the supplies we carry\u2014bridging materials and climbing gear\u2014we will make our way slowly byt steadily through the labyrinth under my careful guidance and shrouded by my magics.  <br/><br/>5. At the same time the spell I had previously prepared will slowly work on the minds of my companions: the labyrinth is the perfect focus for a spell that distorts perception of the passage of time.   We will traverse the labyrinth over four days, but to those who travel with me the time will seem shorter\u2014short enough that they will believe that we have arrived in time to save the town, when instead we will only arrive when the dragon has already left to destroy it.<br/><br/>5. Thus we will arrive while the dragon is absent from the caves\u2014as my familiar will warn me from his station on the slopes of the mountain.  We will have to move quickly: gathering the treasure trove in the highest part of the smooth-hollowed cave-system; setting up the preconstructed iron dams with their sluice gate; turning the gold to molten metal using my magics and the alchemist\u2019s fire; maintaining the temperature with the coal fires.<br/><br/>6.  When the dragon returns, furious, from its expedition\u2014and no doubt expecting our presence from the terrified survivors\u2014it will be met with a torrent of molten gold.  In the narrow tunnels where it cannot help but crawl on its stomach there will be not escape.  It will not be able to avoid the boiling flood; its fiery breath will be useless; and its iron scales will offer no protection.<br/><br/>\u201c...the townsfolk may not thank me, but the dragon will be dead.  And with its teeth...\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191765/#Comment_191765" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T21:37:36+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  9:37PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>I don't understand those die mechanics.<br/><br/>Can you explain what "roll 2-6 in 6" means, and how very likely and really likely differ?</blockquote>\nDoh!

Fiendish and devious! I love it!  <br/><br/>In its favor: The materials you describe should be readily available, and I think you should have the kind of knowledge to pull it off. The spell is consistent with your magic, which is described as being able to sway minds. <br/><br/>Against it: There are a lot of steps to this argument and quite a few places where things could go wrong.<br/><br/>I rule it as pretty likely. However, I'm going to leave off point 6, since we're just toing up to the point where you encounter the dragon. Actually roasting it will require its own argument.<br/><br/>Also, as a counter-argument, I propose that everthing goes to plan, except that you arrive late, and the gold is not yet molten when the Dragon returns to its lair. <br/><br/>Now I roll the dice... a 6!<br/><br/>The enraged dragon arrives to an unleashed flood of molten gold.

There, the Assassin and any archers I have rounded up will emerge from their hiding places at the rim of the crater, firing arrows, and weakening up the beast.

After asking after all the knowledge the town has of the dragon and finding out about its great pride and massive labyrinth lair, she will set out for the dragons lair, approaching the labyrinthe after a short trip on foot. The maze is a treacherous place, full of ancient crumbling stone, tight passages, and large grandiose rooms now covered in sheets of ice, but Jenna is able to avoid its many dangers with relative ease, having been brought up in the harsh wilds of the wastes. While on her way to the dragon's chamber she stumbles upon the perfect place for her upcoming battle: a wide chamber with a relatively low ceiling, in its center what was once a massive lake has become frozen over by a thick layer of ice. <br/><br/>She then approached the dragon boldly and makes her claim: "Dragon! I am Jenna, barbarian of the wastes. The town of Thunderfast told me of you, but I am not in their employ- although if you defeat me, you shall be free to take all their gold, as I have slain all others in the town who would be capable of opposing you."<br/><br/>"I'm sure that such a being as you must be constantly bothered by inept fools looking to slay you for some quick gold, why just last week I heard of an Itinerant wizard who came to your lair, only to be promptly devoured. But I am no such fool. I am the greatest of warriors and I wish to see if <i>you</i> are worthy of challenging <i>me</i>, for I am the greatest warrior ever to emerge from the race of humans."<br/><br/>"But we cannot battle in your grand chamber! No, we wouldn't want the throes of our mighty battle to damage your magnificent collection of treasure that you have taken over the years. But at the same time, I would not lure you into a trap like some dishonorable wizard. No, we shall do battle in your home territory, simply in a different location. Come, oh great dragon, there was a room not to far from here that I passed which shall serve perfectly as our battleground...." <br/><br/>"Great" she thinks, "he bought it. He's sure to use his breath of fire and plummet him into the ice water of the chamber, and the low ceiling will prevent him from escaping the reach of my great sword. I actually do want a fair fight, but after all, I'm taking these measures to ensure <i>fairness</i>...."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192254/#Comment_192254" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T08:52:45+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  8:52AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>Ah, Chthonia the Itinerant Wizard knows what to do.</blockquote>\nA very nice plan...

Not out of pity, of course.  And not even for the gold that is on offer.  Instead, she has required no compensation from the council of elders except to force both the temple and the wizarding community to do her bidding.  <br/><br/>There are ancient rituals -- pieces of which have been collected over the many long years of The Mosquito's career, that can turn an ordinary arrow into certain death for any mortal creature.  While some of the ritual elements go against the teachings of the temple and the customs of the wizards, the preassure put by the dragon onto the people of Thunderspire have inclined them to make exceptions.  The Mosquito now has a sting -- a single arrow, unlike any known in the modern era.  She could take her new prize and depart, leaving the town to it's fate.  She has considered this many times.  But she never defaults -- her clients know that.  Maybe one day she will.  It will be her final contract.  But it won't be today.<br/><br/>Each of the past four days she has spent the time scouting Thunderfast peak and the labyrinth while the priests and wizards toil for her.  She has realized that even with her extraordinary skills and abilities, the chances of sneaking into the dragon's lair are quite poor.  And so, she has decided not to do so.  She will wait and use the dragon's own plan against it.  When it comes to burn the town, it must depart the cavern, fly over the lip of the crater, wheel to the south and approach the town from the north between two mountains -- perfectly lined up to ignite the town in a few quick passes.  The Mosquito will sting the dragon from the deep shadow of a crevase on the cliff above the town to the west.  <br/><br/>And her planning has paid off.  The dragon, infuriated at the lack of payment has come to roast the filthy bipeds who disturbed her, just as The Mosquito expected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193556/#Comment_193556" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T08:48:39+00:00" title="February 22, 2009  8:48AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>The assassin known only as The Mosquito has answered Thunderfast's plea for help.</blockquote>\nOK, sounds like a plan!

The narrow twisting tunnels of the entrance worn smooth by the worm's belly over hundreds of years.<br/><br/>3. The beast itself, lithe and strong, covered in iron scales but with vulnerable wings.  <br/><br/>The situation itself was almost perfect: the tunnels provided the perfect conduit for the molten metal--little would be lost in cracks and crevices; it would be difficult for the creature to evade the flood and almost impossible for it turn around if caught at the right moment; its fiery breath and iron scales would provide no defenses.  <br/><br/>The searing flood pours over the dragon, burning its muzzle, searing its feet and a long swathe of its underbody, destroying its wings completely. The creature would probably die and die quickly, but there was no reason to leave things to chance, to allow the possibility that in its death throes it might destroy them.<br/><br/>So, as the sluice gate is opened and the flood of gold unleashed, Irimitas stands apart from the his helpers, holding in his carefully gloved hands a beaten sheet of metal in the runnels of which a thin thread of gold trickles as he tilts and turns the sheet.  He thinks back to another magic, his Iron Cobra, he'd conjured it, had he?  Nonsense!  Did they know nothing of magic?  Rather, it had been constructed at great expense and animated by the powers of sympathy: like acts as like; do unto one, do unto the other.  His brow furrows in concentration he moves the sheet, the gold dipped earlier from the molten pool turns, following the channels that are shaped just like the tunnels of the cave, and runs back again.  Below the frantic strruggles of the wounded dragon are overwhelmed by the surging hiss of the molten flood, again and again.

"I've seen more intimidating farmers than you."<br/><br/>"Well we're here" Jenna entered the frozen lake chamber, the ice softly shimmering in the dark of the mountain. "We'll see how intimidating I really am."<br/><br/>"Indeed we will" laughed the dragon as it inhaled deeply, a small spiral of flames already visible in its toothy maw.<br/><br/>Jenna reacted quickly, smashing the ice with her greatsword and diving into the icy waters. The bitter chill froze her to her core, but she resisted its icy lures with the force of someone who had lived in the north her entire life. The dragons flames blasted outwards in a fiery tornado of flames, melting the ice in front of the dragon, but failing to burn Jenna, deep under the icy water as she was. Not long after the dragons blast the remaining ice began to crack and sigh under the dragons immense weight, and it soon collapsed, sending the ancient wyrm into the frigid depths. The dragon did not have the benefit of having lived in winter for many years, and being a creature of fire that lived in a lava heated cave, was quite unused to such cold temperatures. <br/><br/>Jenna swam back up to the surface, scurried up the dragons flailing neck and plunged her sword into its skull with all the force she could muster. A piercing shriek of agony was let loose by the dragon as the rest of its body was claimed by the icy pool, sinking to the dark depths of the lake. Jenna crawled to the passage that connected the lake to the rest of the cavern, totally soaked and freezing cold. <br/><br/>"Well at least now I can call myself "dragon slayer" she said with a chuckle "although I've faced human foes greater than that before. I suppose I shall have to keep seraching in order to find a foe that is truly worthy of my skill."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193863/#Comment_193863" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T07:05:53+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  7:05AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many know that The Mosquito "has trained endlessly with her bow, and rarely misses any humanly possible shot" and "she prefers to strike from the shadows, a technique she has perfected."  Time and again she has employed such techniques.  The trick is in the set-up.  If it were not for the special nature of her quarry, she could finalize this contract wither her eyes closed.  <br/><br/>But this is a dragon and it pays to be cautious.  So, her first attack is one of her normal arrows.  She knows that the dragon is no mere beast.  It will not flee at the first sign of pain.  Instead it will seek to quench the rage that the pain causes.  And so, when the dragon first wheels into view and flies into range, bent on the destruction of the town, The Mosquito lets an arrow fly into the dragon's right eye.  As if on cue, it screams in fiery anguish, turning to hunt whatever would dare to wound her so.  To do so, the dragon must bring the left eye around to direct at the shadows in which The Mosquito hides.  And just as that happens, the other arrow -- The Sting, emerges from the shadow and is buried deep within the head of the now blind, falling and dying dragon.  Soon it is over.<br/><br/>The Mosquito can recover her Sting and that of the dragon's treasure that she desires and on she moves.  It is not her problem that the region around the town of Thunderfast will be plagued for a thousand years by monsters crawling from the pool of dragon's blood that soaked into the ground where the ancient beast fell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193888/#Comment_193888" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T09:22:34+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  9:22AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite> It is not her problem that the region around the town of Thunderfast will be plagued for a thousand years by monsters crawling from the pool of dragon's blood that soaked into the ground where the ancient beast fell.</blockquote>\nNice touch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195865/#Comment_195865" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T09:47:35+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  9:47AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2009 9:50AM by tony_dowler.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry it's taken me so long to close this challenge out.

The purpose of the counter-argument was to provide some continuity, so that the challenge didn't just <i>halt</i> if you missed a roll.

As it was, there was never a chance for a character to try to get out of a situation.  Maybe toughening up your criteria and requiring two failed challenges in a row to take out a character--though that would have made the whole thing much longer.  As it is, I don't think that the counter argument got to shine properly.<br/><br/>Thanks, Tony!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196172/#Comment_196172" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T11:17:20+00:00" title="March  8, 2009 11:17AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had forgotten about this thread.<br/><br/>The dragon emerges, and smashes my barbarian/champion.  I use some illusions to thicken the brush at the edge of the crater, and the archers fire down into the crater, weakening the beast, and gathering my power.  By my calculations we will have time for three volleys of arrows before it breaches the ranks of archers at the lip of the crater.  The archers will retreat, drawing it to me.
