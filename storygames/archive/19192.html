They're a lot like RPG's so I thought I'd provide a bit of information about something that's a bit weird and you may not be aware of.<br/><br/><br/><b>What are they?</b><br/><br/>A Quest is a type of interactive fiction, typically done on forums or message-boards. The author of the quest presents a character and a situation, and the audience suggests things for the character to do. The author then selects one or more of the suggestions, and creates a new post describing how the character attempts to implement the suggestions, and the resulting situation. This continues, back and forth until the story ends or the author stops updating.<br/><br/>That's all a bit dry. I think an example is in order.\n<blockquote><b>Author Post 1:</b> This is SALLY! She is in the KITCHEN. She is six! She wants to eat some cookies but the cookies are on the top shelf and she is too short to reach them! What should she do?<br/><br/><b>Suggestion Post 1:</b> Find a ladder.<br/><b>Suggestion Post 2:</b> Can you ask your mom to give you cookies?<br/><b>Suggestion Post 3: </b>Build a mountain from the corpses of your enemies to reach the cookies! (there is always someone like this)<br/><br/><b>Author Post 2:</b> &gt; Can you ask your mom to give you cookies?<br/><br/>She cooould... but it's not cookie-time which happens only after dinner and only if she's been good. And besides MOM went away and isn't in the house right now. The only person here is MR. BEELZEBUB, and he doesn't give cookies to anyone.<br/><br/>&gt; Find a ladder.<br/><br/>That's a good idea! SALLY goes outside into the BACK YARD. It is overgrown and full of DYING DANDELIONS. The sky is red. SALLY walks through the DYING DANDELIONS to the WOODSHED. Her feet are now covered in DANDELION SEEDS.<br/><br/>The WOODSHED is dark and dusty. There are many strange objects in the WOODSHED. They have funny names like "LATHE" and "ROUTER" and "CHOKE PEAR". There is also a LADDER. The LADDER is big! SALLY is not big. She would have to drag the LADDER to get it to the KITCHEN because it is too heavy for her to pick up. <br/><br/>SALLY thinks doing that might make a lot of noise and wake up MR. BEELZEBUB. <br/><br/>What should she do?<br/><br/><b>Suggestion Post 4:</b> Is there a rug or something? Maybe you could put the ladder on that when you drag it so it wouldn't make so much noise.<br/><b>Suggestion Post 5:</b> Choke pear? Oh dear. I don't think is a good place for us to be. I think we should leave immediately. Go get the police Sally.<br/><br/>...<br/></blockquote>\n<br/><b>Where did they come from?</b><br/><br/>Like with most things, pinning down the first Quest isn't easy. The earliest example typically cited is <a href="http://nepeta.mozai.com/Ruby_Quest" rel="nofollow">RubyQuest</a>, created by Weaver on the Traditional Games board of 4chan. It is about a rabbit named Ruby who wakes up inside a locker and her attempts to escape from an elaborate underwater base. It may not have been the first, accounts vary, but it established a lot of the traditional tropes of the genre.<br/><br/>Quests, especially the earlier ones, lean heavily on existing conventions from the Adventure genre of computer games. In a lot of ways, an art-based quest like Rubyquest, is an Adventure game played by a group of people, where the interactions with the computer are all simulated by the Author. <br/><br/>Things like abstract inventories, 'Weird Puzzle Shit' and fantastical environments are very common.<br/><br/>There has been a trend away from this reliance on Adventure Game tropes in recent years, but seeing them in some form is far from unusual even now. <br/><br/><b>Wait, isn't this just like Homestuck?</b><br/><br/>Andrew Hussie, the author of Homestuck, DID do two Quests (<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=1&amp;p=000002" rel="nofollow">Jailbreak Adventure</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4" rel="nofollow">Problem Slueth</a>), but Homestuck is more properly categorized as a Webcomic. It is styled in the traditional Quest format, and maintains many of the established tropes, but it is non-interactive. <br/><br/>Both suggestions and responses are generated by Hussie himself. There was a suggestion box, but it was not used to control the story and was removed by the beginning of Act 2. Due to the incredible popularity of Problem Sleuth and Homestuck, the volume of suggestions made using them prohibitively time consuming. <br/><br/><br/><b>How do they differ from each other?</b><br/><br/><i>Art / Text</i><br/><br/>The first big division is whether or not the author of the quest uses Art and Words, or only Words. Those that include art are sometimes called ArtQuests and those that do not are often called TextAdventures. <br/><br/>ArtQuests tend to update much slower than their TextQuest counterparts, due to the cost in time and energy to create the art, though they tend to be more popular and find it easier to attract readers.<br/><br/><i>How they pick suggestions</i><br/><br/>On some boards, posts may roll dice, and several quests ask that suggestions roll a die, with the suggestion with the highest die roll being the one picked. This is not common.<br/><br/>Slightly more common than die-rolls is picking the most common or most popular suggestion.<br/><br/>By far the most common method is for the author to simply pick the suggestions that they think would be the most interesting.<br/><br/><i>Secondary Mechanics</i><br/><br/>The majority of quests have no mechanics save for the fictional logic of the author. A tiny minority include secondary mechanics. A secondary mechanic is something that happens inside the adventure and happens after a suggestion has been chosen. <br/><br/>These are often simplified versions of the systems seen in Video Game RPGs, such as hitpoints, mana, levels, skills etc. Thus, the author could pick a suggestion of "Shoot the green alien with your laser cannon" and then roll dice to determine if the character actually hit.<br/><br/>These systems can get very elaborate. The social combat system of <a href="http://tgchan.org/wiki/Lunar_Quest" rel="nofollow">LunarQuest</a> for example is deep and interesting, and could be adapted into an rpg of its own.<br/><br/>A tiny number of them use full rpg systems. <a href="http://www.mspaforums.com/showthread.php?50758" rel="nofollow">CorgiQuest</a>, for instance, is run using the rules for D&amp;D 3.5. This is extremely rare. CorgiQuest is the only one I've ever seen to do this. <br/><br/>Most quests feature a single or very limited set of protagonists, telling the story from their perspective and responding to readers commands. There are a small number of quests that diverge from this format, such as nation-building or warfare quests, but even they often have a traditional protagonist in addition to the RTS style mechanics, and they are few in number. <br/><br/>Despite their rarity, they tend to be very popular when they do show up. <a href="http://mspafa.wikia.com/wiki/Art_of_Domination" rel="nofollow">The Art of Domination</a> is a good example of this style.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20the%20Quick" title="Jack the Quick"><img alt="Jack the Quick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20the%20Quick">Jack the Quick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427881/#Comment_427881" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-02T09:46:15+00:00" title="February  2, 2014  9:46AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Who does this, and where?</b><br/><br/>There are a lot of places where this kind of thing pops up, but as far as I know, there are three main centers for them at the moment. <br/><br/>Like play-by-post rpg's, each community of Quest authors has their own style. <br/><br/><i>4Chan/tg</i><br/><br/>The TG board of 4chan is the oldest Quest community. Due to the way that the 4chan boards work, a thread that is not constantly bumped will fall off the edge of the board. Because of this, they tend to update in long bursts. An author will post several dozen times over the course of a few hours. Due to the need for rapid posting, the use of art is almost non-existent, almost all quests are text-only. I haven't seen an ArtQuest on there in over a year.<br/><br/>Weaver's ability to create serviceable artwork in only a few minutes is a rare skill.<br/><br/>The content of these quests tends to be constrained by the prejudices of the board. While there are quests that feature sexual content, they are in a minority. Roughly half of the quests on this board are fan-fiction of some kind, taking place in one of the popular universes such as Warhammer 40k. In an unexpected twist, there has been a recent run of Magical Girl quests on this board that have been highly popular. <br/><br/>Because threads inevitably vanish off of the board, they are archived on a variety of sites like /suptg.<br/><br/>Text is typically written in a third person limited perspective.<br/><br/><i>TGChan</i><br/><br/>An image board in the 4chan style, but dedicated entirely to Quests. This board does not require constant bumping to retain a thread, thus much longer gaps between posts are possible. This board favors ArtQuests almost as exclusively as 4chan favors TextQuests. There are very few TextQuests, and they struggle to find an audience.<br/><br/>The content of the Quests are nearly all fantasy, and most have non-human protagonists. There are a lot of anthropomorphic animals, but an equal number of quests featuring Kobolds, Goblins and other fantasy races<br/><br/>The use of Adventure Game tropes is very limited here, and Secondary Mechanics are rare. Fanfiction is also rare, most Quests on this board are original content. <br/><br/>Authors typically post once or twice a week, and the quality of art ranges from quick sketches to full digital paintings. <br/><br/>Most Quests are written in third person limited, with a significant minority written in second person limited. <br/><br/>The board is not moderated (much) and Quests may feature sexual content and extreme gore. They typically don't, but they can. <br/><br/><i>MSPA Fan Adventures</i><br/><br/>This is a sub-board of the MSPA forums for Quests. It has a very large and active community. <br/><br/>This is a traditional forum, not an imageboard, so a wide variety of posting schedules exist. Many people post weekly or biweekly. ArtQuests are a majority, but only barely, and there are many TextAdventures as well. <br/><br/>As you can probably guess by the name, the majority of Quests on this forum are Homestuck fanfiction. Despite their number, the community as a whole tends to be dismissive of  FanAdventures, as they are often abandoned very quickly, and there are so many of them.<br/><br/>The non-fanfic Quests tend to be science-fiction or urban-fantasy.<br/><br/>Adventure Game mechanics are common (due to the influence of Homestuck), and Secondary Mechanics are relatively popular.<br/><br/>The art varies significantly, but you tend to see a lot more jagged pixels and antialiased lines on this forum, as well as the use of sprites. <br/><br/>Most adventures are run in a second person perspective ("You are standing in a room."), with a significant minority written in third person limited.<br/><br/>The forum is moderated and Quests may not contain sexual content or gore.<br/><br/><i>Smaller Boards</i><br/><br/>There are a number of other places that have a lot of this kind of content, Spacebattles and Eagletime, but they are comparatively tiny and import most of their culture from one of the main three.<br/><br/><b>Are these RPG's?</b><br/><br/>Good question. I don't really know. They're interactive fiction certainly.<br/><br/>I find most boundary work for RPG's to be dreadfully boring and not particularly useful, but its interesting in this case.<br/><br/>Is the author roleplaying as the character? Maybe, they're interpreting the suggestions AS their character, that might be considered roleplaying. <br/><br/>Are the people making the suggestions roleplaying? They're responding to the fictional scenario with fictional actions, which is usually one of the criteria for roleplaying, but they're responding collectively. <br/><br/>Does a suggestion count as roleplaying if the author doesn't use the suggestion?<br/><br/>Does any of it matter? I pretty sure the answer is 'no'.<br/><br/>I think if you took a 'traditional' rpg, and broke it down into pieces, and did the same thing with a Quest, you'd have almost all the same bits. Characters, shared fictional space, interactivity, randomization, uncertainty of the future, social contract, etc. They're just screwed together into a different shape.<br/><br/>Like you took an rpg and turned it inside out.<br/><br/>That's interesting. <br/><br/><br/><b>What can we learn from these?</b><br/><br/>I think we can learn a lot from these things. <br/><br/>Things I've learned so far:<br/><br/>\u2018This thing we do\u2019 can be done in a lot more shapes and styles then we tend to think that it can, and it\u2019s also being done right now, by lots of people, with great enthusiasm, most of whom have never played a Tabletop RPG, and wouldn\u2019t necessarily like them if they did. <br/><br/>That the technology and format in which we do this thing, dramatically changes the way that we play, and the form that this play takes. Note how ArtQuests tend to be favored on forums where update speed isn\u2019t a necessity. <br/><br/>And that communities, even communities on the internet, tend to become insular, and promote the replication of dominant themes. This tends to happen unconsciously, as part of a larger pattern.<br/><br/><b>How did you get into this?</b><br/><br/>I do one of these myself. It\u2019s called <a href="http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?54354" rel="nofollow">All Night Laundry</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427882/#Comment_427882" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-02T10:27:20+00:00" title="February  2, 2014 10:27AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just gonna mention <i>A Doomed Pilgrim in the Sundered Lands</i>.
