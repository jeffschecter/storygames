A deep theme throughout the series is how institutions affect those involved.  <br/><br/>I thought about hacking Dust Devils but the "Devil" concept is too internal and not exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm contemplating using a hacked version of Lacuna's Static where certain actions create "static" which aggravates your superiors.  At certain points things happen (like on your custom Static chart in Lacuna) as command responds and they apply pressure to you.  How to relieve that pressure?  Put dope on the table and arrest suspects.  That intense struggle between satisfying your superiors and hanging on to the case long enough to make it a true career case is what I'm after.<br/><br/>I completely know how to role-play an in-fiction institution but I'm having trouble coming up with how it could affect you mechanically.  None of the games I own do this, I don't think.  <br/><br/>Yes, Robert, although it doesn't have to be your character sheet.

Failure might accelerate it, but most institutions, particularly those run on lots of hierarchy, work on a notion of "how long will the superior let you muck around before he has to get involved to save his own ass?". For a while, it is sufficient for the chief to know that officers Dick and Jane are out there working the Spot case. If they don't have results by some time, however, then he has to step in and exert more control over them.<br/><br/>This time is also not constant. If the mayor is all over the chief's ass about the Spot case, he gives Dick and Jane a lot less leash. In other words, it matters how much interest the institution has in the outcome.<br/><br/>Lastly, maybe the only reason the mayor cares about the Spot case is that the public (or just the press) is in an uproar about it. In other words, other institutions have the ability to alter how much interest the player's institution has in the outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233788/#Comment_233788" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T00:51:40+00:00" title="September 23, 2009 12:51AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm deliberately doing this in <a href="http://quincunx.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">Quincunx</a>, and used an earlier version of it in <a href="http://www.vulpinoid.com/RSR_A4_sml_bw.pdf" rel="nofollow">Rajah Spiny Rat</a>.<br/><br/>A character only improves through the course of the game by facing complications derived from the traits they identify with. During scene framing there is a 50/50 chance that the player will be able to choose a complication relevant to their character, otherwise one of the players to either side of them chooses a complication from the character's sheet and introduces it into the scene.<br/><br/>Players may choose to accept the complication associated with their trait, thus gaining strength over that trait (and potentially better powers), or they may deny this aspect of their personality (and thus lose some of the benefits associated with this trait).<br/><br/>Traits may link to virtues, vices, paradigms, occupations, mystic powers, hobbies, virtually anything...as long as their is something that might cause issues for the character and something that might provide them a benefit, it has the potential to be used in this fashion.<br/><br/>The concept here is all about dealing with the outside world and identifying oneself in context with the events that happen beyond.<br/><br/>Of course, a series of educational sessions run at Gencon Oz over the weekend have meant that I'll be making some dramatic changes to the Quincunx rules-set. The concept described above will remain intact as it worked quite well, but quite a few other changes will have to occur around this concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
