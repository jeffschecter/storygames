But it's coming along, slowly but surely. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are going to be a bunch of gaming articles coming up, including Bad Gamer Archetypes, the male and female editions, How To Play the Opposite Gender, and some reviews.  I'll probably do a big "Here's where everything is" post once I get it all done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks to everyone here who has had good things to say about it!  I really appreciate your support. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I may be looking to add some other female columnists, because Wordpress will let me do that.  World Domination, it will be mine, oh yes...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112827/#Comment_112827" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T13:03:48+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  1:03PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2007 12:51PM by Eldir.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, the Wordpress site looks cool! You probably won't get around to this until you've at least finished migrating the old columns, but I just thought I'd mention that I'm female, geeky, and write quite a bit, especially on story games, gamemastering, and actual play. Other things I can write about include how culture affects roleplaying, group dynamics and dispute resolution, managing information online, etc. So tell me if that sort of thing is something you'd like to add to your site, if/when you decide to add more columnists.
