You could easily model the conditions to reflect the pull of the darkside. Relationships, Beliefs, and traits would fit your needs for evolving characters and relationships. Combat is tense, dramatic, versatile and streamlined. Helping rules make group actions meaningful. Characters evolve in a natural and logical fashion through play. GMing is super easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think Dogs could work in terms of character and conflict features. Not enough support on the GM side. Hacking sin escalation would be an easy fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarwars Saga is definitely Simy. Starwars D6 I have mixed feelings on. The support and fictional material is AMAZING! But the system is fairly generic. Relationships aren't priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpirit of the Century character setup would be a good fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to run a Mouse Guard game in the near future. I will let you know how that runs. I suspect very well. It's not only the most streamlined version of burning wheel, it is one of the easiest games to run (not just burning wheel, any rpg), and is very... very friendly to hacking!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180764/#Comment_180764" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T10:38:16+00:00" title="November 29, 2008 10:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me throw the Solar System (from The Shadow of Yesterday) into the mix.

I would second the idea that, if you want to use the FATE system in SoTC, getting "Starblazer Adventures" is a very good suggestion, as it is FATE tuned to handle Space Opera from the same time period that the original series came from.  The feel will be there.<br/><br/>The advantages Solar would offer is that the players are more focused on the advancement and reward structure than you have to be and the system's "Bringing Down the Pain" mechanic (called Extended Conflicts in the Solar text) lets you run fast and loose until it is important to the players - then slow down and make it count.<br/><br/>I would also, for my part, suggest a peek at the PDQ# rules from Atomic Sock Monkey.  There is a free download of them at their site and they could be easily used to run Star Wars (as mentioned above, any good game can be - it is because good games and Star Wars both tie into that Mythic element that makes adventure stories so darned good).<br/><br/>All of the above games will make relationships important to play and take the focus off of combat tactics and put it more in terms of cinematic action.  You should be well served by any of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180805/#Comment_180805" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T19:02:47+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  7:02PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I also do not mind if the relationships are directly supported by the system as long as the system is narrativist.</blockquote>\nI don't even know what you're talking about here, so I will bow out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180807/#Comment_180807" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T19:05:36+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  7:05PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like I said on the other thread Star Wars is basically space Samuri with laser swords, robots and princesses riding in hot rods fighting space Nazis.

Corebook and add-ons haven't got any rules about that. In addition to Filip`s post: we have played by the book as long as we could, but after 12 sessions we were dissapointed. Too many useful rules or tables from Revised weren't included in Saga rulebook, instead in new edition there are too many unclear phrases in the new edition (look up on XP anc CL section), this book also has got one of most unfriendly text-pattern I have ever seen (1st place in that category for Cyberpunk v 3.0) - i guess JD Wiker and co published their game too fast - anyway, look at erratas and Jedi Consuelings.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Oh, I see!

In this case that one more force power was decisive. That's the different between Saga and previous edition: in Revised we had duels between force users with unbalanced levels and character with less level still had got chance to achieve his goal/survive encounter. In Saga every level above an enemy gives your character significant advantage.

That is, you are annoyed on principle that you bought an incomplete game?<br/><br/>Is this based on a game failure? That is, during actual play, you and your friends encountered a situation that not only did the rules not cover, but you could not amicably resolve using resources outside the game text?<br/><br/>I think Jason is saying, "Yeah, okay, so the rules don't cover this, but anyone with half a brain can get past it. Here's what we did. The game was fun." And you're saying, "How could the game be fun? The rules didn't say to do that!" But his game <i>was</i> fun. <br/><br/>In my Crazy Sim thread, I gave that example of when things really broke down at the table. Matt thought his character could kill the bear with a dagger. I thought the bear would bowl him over and pin him and eat him. He thought the rules said he could do that, and I-as-DM couldn't do that. I thought the rules said that he could do that if I let him, but supported me in saying that I could overrule him if I thought it was best for the campaign setting. The rules themselves (combined with a clash of player priorities) put us in an untenable situation. The game was not fun, and one of us was gonna go home having lost something important to us (Matt, cuz he wasn't the DM/host/social group leader, and that sorta sucks, doesn't it?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186372/#Comment_186372" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T15:32:42+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  3:32PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2009 3:44PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>Well, you're playing with this houserule that makes all your play a houserule.</blockquote>\nSo are you, so does everybody, so I don't know what your point is.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>Any design that requires the player to simultaneously perform multiple fundamentally incompatible duties (in this case: providing good adversity and protecting the players) is a bad design, unless it includeas a factor that makes both possible at the same time.</blockquote>\nWhere does this come from in the "the GM determines if a skill is sufficiently distracting to provoke an Attack of Opportunity when used" text?

It is impossible for any other kind of loss to ever happen in any kind of RPG.  Especially not in a Star Wars game, where as we have seen in the source material, the main characters are constantly dying and never being captured or frozen in carbonite or watching helplessly while their homeworlds get blown up by giant space lasers.<br/><br/>Remember, folks:  only PC death is a meaningful consequnce of failure!

In addition to that, Filip wrote something very important about this - neither Saga nor Revised nor even d6 emulate the movies (and one beautiful example for that: destroying Executor during the battle in RotJ). But I understand your point, however I haven't played that way since years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>JDCorley</b><br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Yeah, a new force power is cool, but I don't see it as inherently any more unbalancing than anything else you get when you go up a level...in fact, balance was one of the things we were very happy with for nine months.</div>\n</blockquote>\nI must be more precisive - before the campaign finale we had two significant encounters: first between three 3th level PCs and two 5-6th level NPC and second between our PCs (one of them advanced to 5th level) and one 7-8th level NPC (I really don't remember if he was 7th or 8th).<br/>\n<br/>\nThose were two entirely different encounters - both duels were between force users (excluding Kamil's character, who was scoundrel/scout), but they didn't have the same course of events. The first duel was quite fast, balanced but fair, however second was (like Filip said) TPK. Of course I suppose, that those differences may have came from my own experience with Saga rules, but IMO having one or two levels more gave NPCs huge advantage. I think that these differences will dissapear in duels between more experienced oponents (more levels = more options and tactics which may be used by players/GM), but after all these session in Revised and Saga my point is that Saga is much harder for beginning characters than Revised edition and what is more - one level more for NPC makes an encounter unpredictable.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Of course there's risks, sometimes quite important ones. It's just that player character death isn't one of them</div>\n</blockquote>\nLook at Destiny Points and all subsystem involved in them - players CAN chose playing that way (precisely, each Destiny gave you two options, for and against) and then death or other situations may be meaningless in order to achieve goal.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">You mean he didn't just...make one determination, like...like the rule says to?

Like I said below to Accounting for taste I`m too damn tall and my ponglish isn't well <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Filip</b><br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Filip">Filip</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Actually, no. It's a matter of builds and of your, intentionally or not, suboptimal tactics. As Kamil noted, if I was GM-ing, the whole party would have been dead after maybe three sessions.</div>\n</blockquote>\nI guess yes, but I notice one more problem with that. In order to preparing FOT (full-operational-tactics <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) I must know all options and consequences of my decisions. Revised d20 gave me really clarified informations about all these factors (covers, AoOs, force skills/feats and combat actions), so I could make encounters which were suited to my scenarios. While we were playing Saga I didn't have these aids - in every encounter I/we have had some problems with "missing rules" or "ask daddy" and that duel with Sith was on the top of all crashes in our campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Filip said and what is also my "statement" about Saga-flaws:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">It was also impossible for the daddy to provide adversity and challenge for us without establishing fundamental factors of its resolution (and this changed the challenge level beyond what was taken into account by the reward system, incidentally also broken). On multiple occassions the daddy seemed irritated by having to make those determinations (especially after spending a few minutes flipping pages to find a definite answer in the book), and we've been fully empathising, knowing we'd feel exactly the same way if we were in his shoes</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">But don't forget the rules are not meant to emulate the fiction in any way. Either way, not being a Jedi fanboy and not giving a damn about canon, I'm more concerned with what happens in the game when this or that occurs, as it informs my decisions.

My wife hates character creation and no matter how cool it is, it's an absolute horrendous slog for her. So getting into combats where death was on the table for her character was like gambling that the next 2-3 hours of her life would be miserable, and she hated that feeling. So we made a rule that no player character would ever die.  We apply it to all games, not just Star Wars. In the "How We Fragged Our Jedi Commander" scene, they were all playing pregenerated characters and wouldn't have to make a new one if there was a death, because we were just going back to the regular characters anyway.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deckard</cite><br>So, you know, why is there no TV in Star Wars?</br></blockquote>\n...I...don't know how to even start to answer this. Did you want there to be TV? Did you have TV and feel it was against the Star Wars feeling?

Ummm, well yeah. Of course they do; else they'd be playing "GURPS: Space Opera" or some-such. And you're surprised that, even though Sim, they don't harp over the occasional unclear rule (i.e. "system doesn't matter")? Well, I'm not surprise (again) because, for many folks, the rules are only there to quickly handle stuff that can't be freeformed or handwaved or acted out (due to some "fairness" or "realism" or "simulationism" drive).<br><br>Folks want to play to feel like they're in the movie... so, for instance, they don't want to die from a random Storm Trooper blast; they want to die as a sacrifice, in a meaningful way that advances the plot and makes them a martyr or hero (or "beloved" villain). So, for instance, they don't give a shit about tracking hull integrity and shield percentages and atmospheric pressure, they want a whiz bang, WWII-style fighter pilot battle where the fight MATTERS (else, they'd play Star Fleet Battles: The Star Wars mod).<br><br>Note my use of "Sim-as-Nar" above: I think that's a big "mixed agenda" for folks playing within a beloved, specific IP. They care about the details of this or that technology... but ONLY in as much as it drives them to play that has the thematic feel and catharsis they recall from the IP.<br><br>So then, "what is the best RPG for Star Wars" might very well be PTA or It's Complicated or any number of other flexible (generic) systems aimed at developing narrative and theme. Unless you're a grognard, in which case it's going to be the high-Sim, high-detail, every-setting-fact-sacrosanct game like SWd20 or even (as I said in another thread) a very detailed Hero Campaign Sheet and fistfuls of sourcebooks.<br><br>So I say again: "what is Star Wars" is your first question. The Canon, The EU, or just the setting? Start here:<br>* Can the PCs kill Luke before Episode IV?<br>* Can the PCs destroy the Death Star while Luke is blasted out of the sky by Vader?<br>* What's more important: accurate simulation of the technological capabilities, or how the technology is largely irrelevant WRT theme?<br><br>Those basic questions will determine (a) the degree of setting protection the game must have and (b) the focus of play at the table, the creative agenda.<br><br>Knowing that (for a specific group!) will let us rattle off probably ten different RPG systems which could "get at" Star Wars... as that group sees it only.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deckard" title="Deckard"><img alt="Deckard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deckard">Deckard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186669/#Comment_186669" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T15:23:54+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  3:23PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 4:05PM by Deckard.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>JDCorley:</b><br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Did you want there to be TV?

I`m only a bit curious how can we chose the best system, if:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. we don't know anything about the agony`s group, and<br/>\n2. we know, that every group include people with different priorities, and at least and last...<br/>\n3. most groups have their most preferred system which emulates SW (in their opinnion) and they still return to this title, even if it crashes or has some flaws.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour questions are fair and valuable and they can help in some way, however they make sense only then, when all or most of players (running PCs and the GM) can give reasonable answers. That's IMO the worst thing with games - all our discussion is worthless when the only person who has decisive vote is... the GM (surprise!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I may, please do not use terms from the Big Model - I haven't read essays since years, I am not familiar with the Forge so I can't answer in a clear way about this model.

As an actual Star Wars game, it doesn't have much to do with Star Wars past the title.

It clearly isn't a perfect system for Star Wars, that's certain.</div>\n</blockquote>\nI suppose that some of our experiences were the effects of my scenario (mixed graphic novels, some part of movies and my own creativity). On the other hand I agree with you, because a game must provide aids useful in running near every type of scenario - from Blast`em all (or rather "Frag grenades wars") to Plot`em and then blast, including some mix from comics, movies and novels or even computer games. And it doesn't do it.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">But I guess it was the point when we finally dropped any pretences of actually playing a game and just rushed to wrap the activity up so that we could move to something more playable.</div>\n</blockquote>\nPowerful but quite a fair point.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">If we weren't ready to have our asses handed to us, we'd play some softie Nobody Gets Hurt Story Games instead.

Maybe everyone else believes it, maybe they don't, probably they just roll their eyes and go "there goes Jason talking about something that doesn't make any difference again".  But a demonstration is a good way of practicing with a system, trying out new things that you might not be eager to do with your "main" character, learning things about a system you might not have noticed at first, and also, as I noted, it had great story effects.

You know, I'm still a bit confused, because every demonstration is a statement. Moreover - in games where GM authority is significant (and Saga or d6 seem to be like that) every important element comes from GM (or may be changed by him). Let me show you something:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">If I, the GM, say "it's possible for teamwork to overcome powerful badguys in this game", that doesn't demonstrate anything.

Your statement is quite clear: "something bad and powerful is waiting for players and it can be overcome by good teamwork". What is more, I bet you a beer that some players may interpret your words as "..and ONLY teamworking can save us". In an rpg with a strong GM authority there is no place for eyes rolling, unless GM wants intervene to save those unlucky or ignorant players.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to my words before - my point is that every statement is a demonstration and vice versa - every demonstration is a potential statement (please notice the fact, that in traditional rpg players can only guess which GM's declarations are significant, but the GM knows which facts are important for his scenario).<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Houseruling doesn't imply there's a problem to be fixed!

Improvement is a part of a process consisting of step/situation A (before) and step/situation B (after). Now you said that the only reason why you changed the rules is a will to make them better. I ask: better than what? Doesn't better mean "without some defects which made thing worse"?<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">.I wasn't complaining?

Maybe it's just semantics, but I see "problem" as things that are generally wrong or bad.  Generally, most players I've hung around with and played with are cool with character death in d20 games. I am. But my wife isn't. That doesn't make Star Wars Saga (or any game) flawed for including it, so they don't have a "problem".  <b>I</b> may have a problem, as game organizer, and <b>she</b> may have a problem, as game player, but the problem doesn't belong to the game itself since most players don't have that preference.  (This is a side effect of believing that all play is customization of the written material - you must take responsibility for your own preferences!)<br><br>The other subsystems linked to death still worked terrific, because the players still played hard to avoid characters being knocked out, knowing that the consequences for that would still be bad. (Just not death.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deckard</cite>what is the purpose of that demonstration in a game where missing, flawed or unwritten rules are replaced by "GM determination"?</blockquote>\nI disagree that "GM determination" is not a rule.

Huh? Where did I say this? I just said it was a great game, and it is. Nothing in this vale of tears and woe we call life is without flaw.  Did we run into any "problems" in the normal sense of that word? No. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deckard</cite>OK, I see your point, but IMO it can creates some problems with some titles I know. What about games which include a boardgame structure, heavy and precise rules?</blockquote>\nGreat question. There are games that are not amenable to easy customization or wide ranges of play. (These are the same thing.)  Then it's doubly super-important that you be aware of and responsible for your preferences, so you will be able to quickly identify that a game of that kind is not for you and not waste your time banging on the walls over and over. <br><br>My current group dislikes narration passing. They're aware of it and take responsibility for it. If we consider playing a game with narration-passing in it, we have to decide whether that element is important, unimportant, central, peripheral, how many other things might be changed by changing it, and so on. It doesn't have anything to do with any flaw or positive element of the game if we decide "hey, we can play this game THIS way and have fun" or "shucks, we can't play this and have fun." It's us taking responsibility for our preference. <br><br>Primetime Adventures is a brilliant game. I will defend it against all comers. With a stick. But it is not right for my current group because the narration-passing is too centralized a part of it. Is that some flaw of Primetime Adventures? Is it a "problem" that Primetime Adventures has that needs to be fixed? No, certainly not.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>Well, as you note yourself, GMs in complicated games can be wrong.

Fortunately they give some excellent advice on how to GM the game so as to increase the possibility that your GM will make good calls. And most GM bad calls are not game-breakers.

What is more if you look at both rulebooks, you will notice that Saga contains 14 pages of advices, but the Revised has much more (25 pages or so).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm curious about one more thing. Saga was released as the next stage of Star Wars d20 so all promotion was directed at those players who had been playing Revised. However it is possible that WotC have tried to sell Saga to newbies who didn't play Revised or other editions. So I ask: if Saga is for newbies, why doesn't it have as much advice as the Revised. On the other hand if Saga is for veterans of previous edition (including me), why does it change rules so much (from complex rules and limited GM determination to "ask the daddy mode")?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deckard" title="Deckard"><img alt="Deckard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deckard">Deckard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187382/#Comment_187382" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T11:25:46+00:00" title="January 10, 2009 11:25AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2009 2:29PM by Deckard.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">It is for most RPG players, up to a point at least.
