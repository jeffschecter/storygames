Baron Munchausen. Polaris, probably, and... well, now I'm off down the slippery slope and basically have to start naming everything that isn't a "trad game." <br/><br/>Yeah, see, lately I'm starting to think/fear that in the end, the definition of "roleplaying game" is going to boil down to "those story games which play essentially just like D&amp;D," and then we keep dickering about what constitutes "essentially" until the end of time, splitting hairs on the heads of angels...<br/><br/>When Willem and I led the indie-RPGs discussion at Bar Camp Portland, we ran smack into this wall as soon as we tried to talk about anything, where nobody could agree on what an RPG was, and definitely nobody agreed with <i>me</i> on what an RPG was. I was trying to use something not too far from my story-games definition. A gentleman whose name I didn't get, shame on me, told me no, it's important that the RPG term continue to refer to the experience that people expect.<br/><br/>All at once I realized he was exactly right. There's an influential computer programmer named Steve Yegge who gave a very funny talk last year about "marketing for programmers," in which he used tech jargon to explain it all: "a brand is a CONST pointer." (CONST being a variable type in C++ that you can't ever change after you define it, and a pointer being a variable that doesn't really hold anything meaningful on its own, but points into a certain spot on something else.) You can't move a brand; once the culture is decided about it, it's decided. GTE learned this when it tried to shake the reputation "GTE = crap network" by building an awesome network. It failed, nobody changed their minds about GTE, and nothing changed - until they changed their name to Verizon. Then people said, hey, new carrier, great network! and the shareholders lived happily ever after.<br/><br/>The term "role-playing game" is a brand. It does mean a certain thing, just not a well-articulated thing, and not always the exact same thing, but much more certain than a lot of us think. I think that is worth respecting, and not just because trying to change what it means in the wider culture is doomed. I think the people who seek out the experience they know by the term "role-playing game" have a point when they say it's already hard enough to know whether it'll be the experience they want, without us throwing things like stakes-resolution and player-control currencies under that rubric.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151896/#Comment_151896" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T11:46:42+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 11:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite><br/>Because once you let GURPS in there, there goes the neighborhood?<br/>-Marco</blockquote>\nHeh.

Story game is the term for what the broad definition of RPG should be, if the culture hadn't decided it was a very limited thing in the first few years and then didn't begin to challenge that for another 20 (a challenge that's still very much in the minority).  At least, that's how I use it. <br/><br/>So, I agree with David. Story Game is that term that breaks us out of the unfortunately limited definition of RPG. But a monopoly game where you roleplay your counter or a chess game that inspired a novel?  No. Those aren't story games.<br/><br/>However, I don't also figure, okay, RPG is that definition.  No, language changes, so to me, RPG and Story Game are almost synonymous.  There's a bit of venn diagram going on. There are some RPGs that aren't story games (much of the mainstream stuff) and there are some story games that aren't RPGs (Once Upon a Time), but most of them are both. And hopefully, 20 years later, RPG won't be crammed into a corner of "actor stance players of a single role, and an author director, with rules focused on physical capabilities, especially combat." But the way to change that is to not use that definition.  Sure, if you're doing some presentation, you have to speak to your audience, but not in general usage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151909/#Comment_151909" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T12:16:25+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 12:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 12:20PM by David Artman.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>How can you define a rpg on the basis of the kind of experience, when you can't define that experience?</blockquote>VERY broadly. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Reminds me of trying to define "pool."

It's going to be really hard. But...<br/><br/>Back when Scott McCloud wrote <i>Understanding Comics</i>, and he put his definition of comics out there (for those unfamiliar, it's "pictorial and other images, visually juxtaposed in deliberate sequence"), there were people outraged that he left out <i>The Far Side</i>, which (usually) had only one image rather than any juxtaposition. Leaving aside the people who thought that there was some kind of status game going on and that something "worthy" was being "left out," you had a lot of people who just couldn't consider a definition of comics reasonable if it didn't account for everything that appeared on the comics page (except the chess column). <br/><br/>But things were already changing. First, nobody knew it yet, but the newspaper comics page was becoming less and less important to the comics medium. So, the context that shaped so much of their internal felt sense of the definition was already starting to shift out from under them. Second, once the shock wears off, people actually do figure out when you're using a term as a category term rather than a status marker. It just takes a bit.<br/><br/>So, I'm just as okay with leaving one or two of the groups you cite out of the RPG category as McCloud was with the word "comics" not applying to <i>Family Circus.</i> Leave out too many and you aren't doing your job, but the job is to correctly find the line. If a couple of groups (I'd say your first example, definitely) find that they've actually been playing something other than an RPG this whole time, well, their game is gonna be just as fun for them, even if it takes a few years to get used to the change of terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151912/#Comment_151912" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T12:29:32+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 12:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I'm not really a fan of the term Story Game at all.

It was a response to a bunch of reviews / internet bullshit where people were saying stuff like "Polaris / My Life With Master / Universalis / etc. are not roleplaying games."  And Clinton basically said, "I'm sick of this bullshit; I don't care what is or isn't an RPG.  I'm just going to start calling everything I do 'story games' and not worry about what definition they fall into."  So, in that sense, it's a real tragedy that a bunch of people have tried to turn "story game" into yet another tiny label for a specific kind of game.  In my mind, it happened like this:<br><br><b>PEOPLE:</b> We don't have a term for all these weird indie games.  Both World of Synnibar and 1001 Nights are indie games.  WTF?  How will we ever distinguish the hippy stuff from the grognard stuff?<br><br><b>ANDY:</b> Doo doo doo.  I'm going to start a forum called "Story Games" were we can casually talk about all kind of stuff that might or might not be RPGs.<br><br><b>SG FORUM USERS:</b> Dirty hippy game stuff!  D20 sucks!  Brain damage!<br><br><b>PEOPLE:</b> Hey, all those people on Story Games talk about dirty hippie indie games all the time.  Clearly that's what "story games" means; games that are about the <i>story</i>.<br/><br/><b>SG FORUM USERS:</b> 4e rocks!  Githyaki 4ever!  Man, you know what's awesome?  Killing things and taking their stuff.<br/><br/><b>PEOPLE:</b> WTF?  Why are you on SG?<br/><br/>Which brings us to the present.  Honestly, I'm pretty much over trying to create terms for different bits of roleplaying or play styles.  If I want to talk about a specific kind of game or play style, I describe it, instead of relying on a term that's likely to be misinterpreted.  Even then, miscommunication is likely, but I think it's much more unlikely than it is when people throw labels around.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151922/#Comment_151922" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T12:50:40+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 12:50PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 12:56PM by James_Nostack.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, tell you what: rather than arguing about this deductively, what's the <b>operational</b> difference between playing a Story Game and playing a Role-Playing Game?

I've been trying to define it, in my mind, based on the words that comprise the term (which, incidentally, is the same way I form the defnition of the term "role-playing game" in my mind, by using the words in the term)<br>Based on that, I see the two terms as defining separate sets, neither a sub-set of the other, but overlapping in some places.  The way I see it, there are RPGs that are not SGs, SGs that are not RPGs, and there are also games that are both and games that are neither.<br>I would argue for a game like Once Upon a Time potentially being an SG in that it could be a game with a strong focus on story.  Hence, Story Game.<br>But perhaps the term Story Game has been defined in a way that is not simply a Game about/with/focused-on Story?                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151927/#Comment_151927" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T13:08:27+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  1:08PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Personally, I'd define "story games" as, "whatever the people on S-G want it to mean, which tends to be (but is not exclusively) games from about 20-30 designers sharing certain features and a general emphasis on face-stabbing."</blockquote>\nRight, like D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151929/#Comment_151929" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T13:16:54+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  1:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are these things we're discussing really <i>games</i>?

While this may at first seem a simple task, he then goes on to lead us through the problems with each of the possible definitions of the word "game". Any definition which focuses on amusement leaves us unsatisfied since the feelings experienced by a world class chess player are very different from those of a circle of children playing Duck Duck Goose. Any definition which focuses on competition will fail to explain the game of catch, or the game of solitaire. And a definition of the word "game" which focuses on rules will fall on similar difficulties.<br/><br/>The essential point of this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein's point is not that it is impossible to define "game", but that we don't have a definition, and we don't need one, because even without the definition, we use the word successfully. Everybody understands what we mean when we talk about playing a game, and we can even clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game.<br/><br/>Wittgenstein argues that definitions emerge from what he termed "forms of life", roughly the culture and society in which they are used. Wittgenstein stresses the social aspects of cognition; to see how language works, we have to see how it functions in a specific social situation...<br/><br/>Wittgenstein rejects the idea that ostensive definitions can provide us with the meaning of a word. For Wittgenstein, the thing that the word stands for does not give the meaning of the word...<br/><br/>Why is it that we are sure a particular activity \u2014 e.g. Olympic target shooting \u2014 is a game while a similar activity \u2014 e.g. military sharp shooting \u2014 is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process \u2014 generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that the same is true of language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151931/#Comment_151931" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T13:24:34+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  1:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 1:28PM by James_Nostack.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I think we need to go into Wikipedia and Gygax that passage up a notch, because it already comes so close.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Everybody understands what we mean when we talk about playing a game, and we can even clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nPlainly Wittgenstein never saw RPG.Net.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151943/#Comment_151943" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T13:42:23+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  1:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 1:42PM by Valamir.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>But to me...its an RPG, and holding it out as an example of a Story Game that's not an RPG makes me cringe.</blockquote>Aww, Ralph... uncringe. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>*I*, at least, explicitly said "Universalis in strict Director Stance;" i.e. no one ever actually assumes a role, but does a lot of third-person narration and meta-game thinking about how to shape the plot using the rule set. (Hmmm... Is acting requisite to role playing...? If not, I am in a "role" as the little dog, in Monopoly, right; or I'm in the "role" of the dealer, in poker, yes...? Aw, fuck, my head....)<br><br/><br/>I view the proper definition of RPG as applying to the activity of what people are doing.  When applied to the thing that they are doing it with the label RPG refers to a thing that is typically, commonly, primarily used to promote that activity.<br/><br/>So I would say that ANY game which are you 100% in strict director stance is not an RPG activity, even if the rules set you are using is something we would call an RPG.  Further I would say ANY game in which you are performing the RPG activity is "playing a roleplaying game" even if the rules set you are using is not commonly used for that purpose.<br/><br/>So, to take your monopoly dog perhaps more seriously than you intended.  If you are portraying the dog's personality, making choices for the dog the way the dog would make choices and playing as an advocate of your dog than yes you are roleplaying.  If we set aside the literally interpretation of the figurine and instead suggest that that figure merely represents H.Terrance "the Terrier" Puffinstuff, real estate tycoon...and you are portraying H.T.'s personality, making decision the way H.T. would make them and acting as an advocate for the interests of H.T. (which may or may not coincide with the stated objective to bankrupt all the other players and win...then yes you are using the Monopoly rules as part of your roleplaying activity.<br/><br/>As for what identifies a "Story Game" as a particular kind of roleplaying game...to me its a roleplaying experience that focuses on dramatic interaction between characters using a system that empowers players to explore and develop those interactions.  And again I think of it as an activity not a thing.  So you can totally Story Game with D&amp;D...even 4E if you are focusing on dramatic enteraction between characters and exploring and developing those interactions.  And you can totally not Story Game with things that we typically think of as "Story Games".  <br/><br/>There's lots of sessions of Univeralis I've played that would call something like World Building or Setting Exposition but wouldn't call a "Story Game".  There's other sessions that most definitely have been.<br/><br/>IMO, label the activity that you are actually doing when you're doing it.  Label the game only in so far as it helps to identify games that are easiest to achieve the activity...but understand that the definition defines the activity not the rules / text / book / thing.<br/><br/><br/>That's how I see it.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151949/#Comment_151949" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T13:55:13+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  1:55PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I haven't been on this forum long.

In other words, we can still avoid making with "story game" the mistake we made with "role-playing game:" giving a very general name to a comparatively specific experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151978/#Comment_151978" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T14:44:11+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  2:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ah, ok, I see where you're coming from.<br/><br/>Yeah...I have some pretty strong negative reactions to that approach...I'm not sure I can effectively articulate them at this point, however.

Killing things and taking their stuff.<br/><br/><b>PEOPLE:</b>WTF?  Why are you on SG?</blockquote>\nActually, the first part (the one Before "ANDY") goes like this:<br/><br/><b>Some Random Folks on RPGNet:</b> "Clearly My Life With Master is not a roleplaying game, because in a role-playing game you are not supposed to have an "endgame". The very definition of RPG is that the game can go on for as long as you want to play it.  Also, Capes isn't an RPG, because there's no GM, and a GM is absolutely necessary for gaming. Also, Game X is too focused to be an RPG, because there are no rules for radiation, encumberance, drowning or falling, because a role-playing game absolutely requires rules for those sorts of events. Or games with rules about how you feel, because that is the purview of the player, and don't you dare tell me what my character is supposed to feel! Now, I'm not saying that those games are BAD, but they're CLEARLY not role-playing games."<br/>(to which I drive a pencil into my template, because my definition of Role-Playing Game is "One must <b>Play</b> a <b>Role</b>" (that is, 'act it out'), and fuck all that other shit.)<br/><br/>Clinton, on some blog way back when, says: <br/><br/>CLINTON: "LOL, Shit, I guess I'll call those games Story Games or someshit."<br/><br/>ANDY: ". . . niiiiiiice name!"<br/><br/>ANDY then promptly registers the domain story-games.com, fully intending to use it as - can you guess? - a company name/label for when I eventually release a few RPGs that I'd been tooling around with (note: still tooling, 3 years later, but I'm more interested in playing than tooling these days). <br/>A few months pass...<br/>A few more...<br/>Then, I decide that I want to create a new private/low-key forum to bullshit about all RPGs, but focusing on play, play techniques, and those hippie crazy games that aren't talked about on other forums (and being heavily inspired by the Forge Birthday Forum, which I loved a lot: Talking about the games, not just design). Having no other ideas for a name, my tooling RPG projects in a state of "never gonna be released at this rate", and having that spare domain name, I decided to basically attach that forum to this domain name, and blat: Story-Games.com (the forum) was invented.<br/><br/>Then the rest of the dialog continues as-is, above.<br/><br/>Since I created the domain, I've tried to sum up what I mean by Story-Games, but honestly, every definition I've thought of was either exclusionary, or transient... and all my definitions were like as if writing with water on a sheet of glass. So I kinda gave up. Somewhere I said "an RPG which focuses on 'our story' over 'my character', and while I feel that may be closest, it really - heh - doesn't seperate them from RPGs.  Most RPGs as is focus on My Character. But guess what, put a little elbow grease into anything from L5R (which I'm doing now, S-G Style-e) to HERO to GURPS to D&amp;D, and you can play it from the ground up of "Story (Setting/Background/The Conflict) First, then we make up our Characters". Like, with no work at all, really, just need to look at it from a new angle.<br/><br/>If anything, I'd call it a way of looking at playing your game rather than a "class" of game, a very simple twist in the way you address the game as a whole, that takes no coercion of trad players or even hippie-mechanics.<br/><br/>But they're a subset (that is "all of") RPGs. If there was a Venn Diagram, what I consider RPGs would fall exactly on top of what I consider Story Games (or potential story games or whatever).<br/><br/>For me, personally? Story Games, the word, is the name of this site where we bullshit about interesting ways to play RPGs, any RPG. WIth, yeah, a nod, wink and some focus to both the New Hotness (in all forms, see games when they first come out, like "4e"; IAWA; Red Box Hack; etc) and what I refer to as "Hippie Games" ("There's no strength or damage, instead I roll my ennui and do depression damage, and move tokens around on a board-gamey board as the story progresses").<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152002/#Comment_152002" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T15:32:33+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  3:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 3:34PM by Thunder_God.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree with giving names as "Brands", it might be the most practical thing, but I dislike it, and see it as a continuing sickness.<br/><br/>Andy, wait for my post, but I'm the other way around.

The brand was "D&amp;D", not "rpgs". And the "battle" to avoid losing the name to computer games is already lost. They are the "role-playing games", and ours are the "tabletop role-playing games". Even if most of the new games don't need a tabletop or a table to be played at all.<br/><br/>There is money, recognition, respect, in the "rpg" brand, or something of value? Or it's something that has now even negative connotations for most of the potential market?<br/><br/>I mean, I don't contest using "rpgs" here, to talk in a forum, to talk about these games.

It would be nice to get away with it, though; I mean, people <i>know</i> history. At least, the people who care about RPG being defined have a tendency to know history. And it nicely lets people know what's important while letting them choose for themselves <i>exactly</i> what's important, and self-select their game in or out of the definition.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>Actually, this sounds more like D&amp;D/d20 and their kin to me, the status of which as "RPGs" is often contested by people. The kind of games that people identify as "role-playing games" without arguing tend to be of the BRP branch (or whichever game was the first to introduce a heavier focus on the simulation of "living in the world" and role-playing than wargaming stuff,</blockquote>\nAs much as I have talked about being willing to leave some stuff out, one of my main goals for a definition is to apolitically match most of common parlance. In short, I am not interested in kicking out the world's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> self-professed RPG.

they don't define the phenomena, it goes by "You'll know it when you see it", or, we define as X things which do not follow the heart, but only the trappings:<br/>Is a game with mana, health, levels,

But it also runs completely counter to everything that most of us learned that games were, growing up. <br><br>Most of us, I think, learned that a game, one that had a name anyway, was a thing, one thing, that felt a certain way to play. Now, even at the level of hopscotch, Othello and Twister, we were often wrong, but we usually learned that in terms of "I don't want to play that with him, he's no fun." The people who gather around a game make it a different social experience. But despite that, people are accustomed to being able to point to a game, with a name, and say what kind of thing you'll be doing. "Board game" is a very useful way of doing that. "Card game" is too, although a little less so.<br><br>"Roleplaying game" is not. Someone who doesn't know what one is will learn a different and incompatible meaning for the term, depending on the random chance of who describes the concept to them (or more likely, shows them a game in play) first.<br><br>For someone who finds the cultural confinement of the hobby frustrating, that's a problem. It would help a great deal if it were natural for people to define a game based on the particular gathering of people in one instance of it, rather than its name and a rough category... but that simply does not come naturally to most people. Asking them to do so from the jumpoff would create enormous cognitive dissonance.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152758/#Comment_152758" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T14:49:13+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  2:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2008 2:52PM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>Also let's remember that this whole string of discussions basically started with "Waiter, there's some D&amp;D in my Story-Games, I'd like to speak with the cook, please...", so the topic is not without implied negativity, at least sometimes.</blockquote>\nThat's the funny thing about split-off threads; even with a link to the original topic for context, they often become about something totally different.

But I don't think it's coincidence that sports and cards are the two forms of games that have accepted places in adult life in this country. Show a tabletop game to just about anyone, and they don't have an emotionally mature frame of reference to bring to bear; in the US at least, the last time they played a board game they were probably nine. The most socially articulate thing they learned to do in the tabletop-game frame specifically? Was probably to stop playing them.<br><br>So no, I don't think it breaks down along geek-culture lines. There is no common, reliable adult context for tabletop games besides standard-deck card games, and a few board games grandfathered in from our childhoods. New people tend to approach everything else as a total unknown.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152817/#Comment_152817" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T21:51:42+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  9:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Nanofictionary/" rel="nofollow">Nanofictionary</a> hasn't been mentioned yet.
