Hi.<br/><br/>I'm looking for feedback on the basic resolution mechanic for a story game I want to cobble together from other story games.<br/><br/>The short version is: How does a d6 "yes, and" resolution mechanic sit with you? Is it enough, what are the hangups, what should be done with it, is it exciting enough as a gaming mechanic to be interesting? And so on. Just in case, I mean rolling a d6 and the results are: 6: yes, and. 5: yes. 4: yes, but. 3: no, but. 2: no. 1: no, and.<br/><br/>Characters with significant advantage to a roll will get 2d6 and pick the best, characters with significant disadvantage to a roll will get 2d6 and pick the worst. To resolve an action the player will state their goal, roll the dice, and narrate the outcome. Two PCs going head to head would be each rolling to determine the outcome of their own action, so you get all kinds of variety just from that simple scale. Primary and secondary goals, etc. The "and" and "but" will add assets or complications, depending on the "yes" or "no". So "Yes, but" will be a positive outcome for the PC but include a negative kicker or complication.<br/><br/>Beyond the basic resolution mechanic I'll be pulling from Hillfolk, Fate, Cortex+, Fiasco, HeroQuest 2, Primetime Adventures, Shock:, and others. The goal is to create a story gaming system that models film and television storytelling focused around collaboratively generated scenes. Not from the writer/producer/meta side of things as in PtA, more like the feel of Fiasco (without necessarily being a tragic-action-comedy).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426634/#Comment_426634" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-05T18:51:49+00:00" title="January  5, 2014  6:51PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2014 7:10PM by Rickard.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My main trouble with how "Yes, and" is handled in roleplaying games is that the person who makes the action gets to narrate the bonus. What I find troublesome is that it's a kind of variant of the Czege principle -  "If the same person makes up the problem and solves it, it's boring". The same applies to "Yes, and" for me. The obvious fix to this is to let someone else narrate. This brings the positive side effects that everybody needs to be involved in the action because they can be the one who narrate the bonus, and you also push the the collaboration aspect even further.<br/><br/>(Again, this is something I really like in <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> - the resolution cards creates \xbbactive listening\xab. <b>Panty Explosion</b>, where the enemy is describing failed result and the friend describes to good results, has a similar twist to it.)<br/><br/>The thing I like with "Yes, but" is when, and only when,  it's used as a fail forward mechanic. So even if you fail, the narrator says "Yes, but..." and another situation will appear instead.<br/><br/>I don't fancy "No, and/but". It's just wrong thinking to me. It seems like people just turned the scale around and applied the same thing, without thinking of what it really meant. Previously, I used "Yes, and", "Yes, but" (to add some mismatch) but also "No, because" where the "because" created a new situation. I have kind of abandoned that thought now.<br/><br/>If I were to incorporate this, in for example <b>Apocalypse World</b>, I would have only one skill that says the following.<br/><br/><div><b>Roll 2d6</b><br/>1-6: Yes, but... Choose one effect that you narrate. Someone else must narrate a "but" to create a new situation.<br/>7-9: Yes. Choose one effect that you narrate.<br/>10+ Yes, and... Choose one effect that you narrate. Someone else can add another effect to add to your description.</div><br/>And then I would have different aspects, where you must include at least one to the skill, that gives suggestions of effects and "buts".<br/><br/>(I would actually discard the "but" and instead describe triggers - of when to use aspects - and letting the 1-6 result trigger another aspect for another character to create a situation around that aspect instead.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426635/#Comment_426635" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-05T18:57:54+00:00" title="January  5, 2014  6:57PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2014 6:58PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!

There is a throwaway roll I sometimes do in games when I am stuck that works on a 1-2 failure, 2-3 success at a cost, 5-6 success. Or you could even remove failure altogether and have 1-3 being a success at a high cost and 4-6 as a base success? Or pair the two and say 1-2 is high cost success, 3-4 is low cost success, 5-6 is easy success. I'm sure players will find it more interesting to equal input through rolls instead of someone getting unlucky and simply getting left in the dust. <br/><br/>I do like how the two dis/advantage rolls aren't massively distant but it might be easier for discussion if we know the kind of things players will be rolling for or to do?<br/><br/>The list of games at the bottom kinda disconcerts me though, do you know each thing you are taking away from each game? If it's just general 'I might use this' kind of mechanics or themes I think that list might be a tad long just for simplicity's sake. Less is more and all.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426639/#Comment_426639" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-05T20:58:51+00:00" title="January  5, 2014  8:58PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard, thanks for the link. Archipelago looks vaguely like the direction I was thinking. Another cool game to read at least.<br/><br/>How I thought it would work was the d6 would resolve the scene and the players would rp their way through to that end. So there would absolutely need to be a negative side to things and a severity with that. The PC sets the goal of knocking out the guard. A "yes, and" could mean the guard is knocked out and something else beneficial happens, like say the PC finds the keys to the prison cells; whereas a "no, but" could mean the guard is not knocked out but something good happens, like say he didn't get the chance to sound the alarm.<br/><br/>Most games use a randomizer to determine success/failure and many also use a randomizer to determine severity, if needed. If you're only rolling for severity, ie only variations of yes, I don't really see the point of rolling at all. A varied success with only a simple failure option seems kind of boring. Only success/failure seems limiting, so the next step up in complexity is success/failure and severity. Yes/no is success/failure, the and/but kicker is the severity. How is having the possibility of varied failure "wrong thinking"?<br/><br/>As a scene resolution mechanic, the and/but axis helps to nudge the story in twisty new directions. Like assets or complication from Cortex+. A PC is fighting a guard, he rolls, and gets a "yes, but" so the guard is knocked out or killed, but the PC suffers a setback. I think this would be largely dependent on the scene it was resolving, possibly not to be determined until the players actually role-played through the scene. In the rp someone comes up with a cool idea of the guard's last words being a cryptic taunt that becomes a plot thread to follow. Or it could be as simple as the PC gets a broken leg in the fight.<br/><br/>Jason, thanks for the comment. Yeah, I'm not a fan of really fiddly mechanics, so stacking a dozen +1s for each side only for it to basically even out anyway isn't what I want to bother with at the table. Hopefully fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426640/#Comment_426640" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-05T21:14:49+00:00" title="January  5, 2014  9:14PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2014 10:10PM by liblarva.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SG. Thanks for the reply. Simplest first: yes, there are a few very specific things I want to pull from those games, mostly a mechanic here or there. Or inspiration/tone. What I'm planning is a small game for sure. A dozen to twenty pages at most. <br/><br/>The rolls would be for goal-based scene resolution. So if the scene is a group of PCs fighting a group of guards, the PCs' goal is to knockout the guards, the guards' goal is to capture the PCs. Some PCs will succeed, some fail. Some guards will succeed, some fail. But once the dice are rolled, they would work through the scene however they wanted to toward that resolution. One guard with a captured PC in tow standing across from a few mad PCs. Could happen, sure.<br/><br/>But that would kick the story in a new, unexpected, and hopefully fun direction. The next scene the PCs could try to recapture their friend, or he escapes on his own, or he's taken to the cell next to the captured princess, whatever. The point being the table decides how this result came about, and what happens next, both for their characters and the story as a whole. <br/><br/>To me, success at cost is the same thing as "yes, but". You earn your goal, but something bad happens too. Whether that's a direct cost to the PC, that's a twist to the story, or whatever is up to the table and dependent on the circumstances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426641/#Comment_426641" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-05T23:38:41+00:00" title="January  5, 2014 11:38PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2014 11:39PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How does a d6 "yes, and" resolution mechanic sit with you? . . .

So I would consider weighting them differently. I'd want "yes, but" to be much more common than just "yes", for example.<br/><br/>Consider how Apocalypse World does this, just for fun:<br/><br/>10+: Yes, or sometimes Yes, And. (Some rare moves have Yes -- Acting Under Fire, I'm looking at you! -- or Yes, But, as well.)<br/>7-9: Yes, but.

I'll try to keep up.<br/><br/>David. Yep, FU is one I've read and really liked. Mutually exclusive goals. I expect there to be lots of primary/secondary goals with rolls, and only to very rarely if ever have only a single goal for each participant that's mutually exclusive, say one character wants to escape and the other wants to catch them. As it's a scene-based resolution mechanic, I don't expect rolls to be that simple. But it's definitely something to keep in mind. <br/><br/>Film and television storytelling. One of my complaints with many traditional games is the meandering, almost accidental quality to any story that happens to come out of a game. Of the various storytelling structures, television seems the most accessible and easy to convey. Most one-hour dramas have four acts with an optional teaser and/or tag. The act breaks typically follow the commercial breaks and this structure can handle anything from purely episodic (one-shot stories) to a serial narrative. That and there's a lot of games that center around role-playing in TV show universes, so emulating that structure from the ground up seems like a benefit.<br/><br/>Steve. That's almost exactly the idea. The scale is worded differently, but with the same intent. And the goal is to make it about narrative control, and shared narrative control, rather than just task resolution.<br/><br/>IceCream. Good point about simple no. But the way I'm going to use the dice isn't just for determining what happens next in the story, but rather how a given scene resolves. Or put better, the dice determine this scene and can help with the next, but the table decides where the story goes next. So one or both people involved in the roll getting a simple no just means they didn't earn their goal for that scene, not that the story grinds to a halt. For example, let's say it's a heist game. A PC wants to steal something from a vault and the GM has a guard there. The PC's goal is to get the McGuffin, the guard's goal is to get the PC. If they both roll no, then the PC doesn't get the McGuffin and the guard doesn't get the PC. The whole scene is still played through and the table can come up with where to go next. The dice are meant to help kick the narrative along, but the narrative isn't limited to the dice.<br/><br/>"How is resolution initiated, who describes outcomes, who decides advantage, what scope of actions are resolved..." This is another reason for the TV structure, really. It brings in an emphasis on having a focus for each scene. Every scene needs a conflict of some kind that advances the story, whether subtle or overt. If there's no conflict there's no scene and no real story. At present the dice are only for physical stuff, internal and social outcomes are almost pure role-playing. The table decides what scene happens next, round robin style each player getting to call a scene starring their character in order around the table. The dice determine the outcome of the scene and help kick the narrative with the and/but results. Everyone in the scene has narrative control; the dice don't determine the beginning or middle of the scene, only the end. Most things would be determined by the table with the final decision in the hands of the GM, more like a tie-breaker or facilitator than a traditional GM.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426665/#Comment_426665" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T10:03:39+00:00" title="January  6, 2014 10:03AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting discussion.

The protagonist rarely gets precisely what they want, it's usually a case of "No, and" or "No, but" with an occasional "Yes, but" here or there, and things get more tense with more complications or more at stake until the climactic scene.  So if you're trying to model that kind of structure, I'd also be in favor of taking out the simple "Yes" and "No".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426674/#Comment_426674" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T12:08:18+00:00" title="January  6, 2014 12:08PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2014 12:09PM by catty_big.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to weigh in with some thoughts about the range of options and the desirability of having No/No but outcomes. I used to think FU provided a pretty good framework- i.e. yes/no + either zero, and or but- until I delved into AW-powered games, and I now think AW gives the best possible range, because 1) it speaks to Paul_T's point about unequal weighting, 2) it provides options and hard choices for yes but and no, and 3) it eliminates 'whiffing', i.e even when you 'fail' something always happens. This in turn means that there is always narrative capital to be made from failure, which is IMO a darn sight more satisfying to a player than a simple 'Uh, sorry, you failed'. <br/><br/>I also agree with Rickard regarding the Czege principle:\n<blockquote>My main trouble with how "Yes, and" is handled in roleplaying games is that the person who makes the action gets to narrate the bonus. What I find troublesome is that it's a kind of variant of the Czege principle -  "If the same person makes up the problem and solves it, it's boring". The same applies to "Yes, and" for me. The obvious fix to this is to let someone else narrate. This brings the positive side effects that everybody needs to be involved in the action because they can be the one who narrate the bonus, and you also push the the collaboration aspect even further.<br/><br/>(Again, this is something I really like about<a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> - the resolution cards creates \xbbactive listening\xab. <b>Panty Explosion</b>, where the enemy is describing failed result and the friend describes to good results, has a similar twist to it.)</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426675/#Comment_426675" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T12:19:32+00:00" title="January  6, 2014 12:19PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>When does AW generate "Yes, but" results?

PC vs PC. Each would have their own goal they're rolling for. So they are kind of independent of each other, but both combine to inform the narrative. For example, both PCs want to kick the others ass. If they both roll a "yes" they both get their ass kicked. If one rolls yes, but the other rolls no, one kicks the others ass.<br/><br/>Big Bad and narrative structure. I do have that in the back of my mind, but I'm not sure what I'm going to do, if anything, to handle that. I want to make sure the basic mechanic works well enough at the scene level before worrying too much about the broader picture. The ebb and flow of scene to scene building over time to a climax etc should definitely be addressed, but I'm not sure how railroady it would be to artificially enforce them via bonuses, altered difficulties, or die results.<br/><br/>The overarching structure is basically the same across mediums. Neutral or hard beginning (shit goes sideways from normal, dragging the characters into the story) with mounting troubles and problems, tension builds and builds to a fever pitch as you approach the climax, the heroes win, beat the bad guys, and the tension is released. There's a denouement where things go back to normal or enter the new normal. Games can handle that any number of ways. Increased TNs toward the climax, pass/fail cycle, story points, tilt tables, whatever. I'll likely settle somewhere toward the overview and advice end of things as I want to keep the game as mechanically simple as possible while still being fun as a game.<br/><br/>Some genres also have an easier structure. Crime &amp; mystery shows for example, they're almost always like this:<br/><br/>Teaser (the bit of action before the opening credits): Find a body, cops arrive on scene and make a quip.<br/>Act One: Cops investigate and gather clues. Several people are interviewed and we end the act with a suspect.<br/>Act Two: Cops pursue their suspect but it turns out they're not the killer. Cops start at square one and get a new suspect.<br/>Act Three: Basically the same as Act Two, unless it's Law &amp; Order which switches to the legal side where we get setbacks.<br/>Act Four: We know who did it and we're mostly trying to find out why, trying for a confession, convincing the jury to convict, or having trouble with the judge before the heroes finally win.<br/>Tag (the denouement, the bit after the criminal is caught or the sentence handed down): Wrap up with a quip, and moral, if any.<br/><br/>To make games not railroady while still following the basics of structure I'm thinking the group will game &amp; setting build (a la Fate Core), the GM will formulate the basic idea for a story (based on player desires) and present it as a Teaser to the group. Round robin enough times to be satisfying (once or twice), and cliffhanger or twist when it comes back to the GM to end the Act. Tag/denouement is all about wrap up for the players and the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426690/#Comment_426690" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T15:10:41+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  3:10PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2014 3:23PM by Rickard.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could first of all tell you that I'm kind of tired of the old rag in roleplaying game design that the default state is that the players fail.\n<blockquote>So there would absolutely need to be a negative side to things and a severity with that. The PC sets the goal of knocking out the guard. A "yes, and" could mean the guard is knocked out and something else beneficial happens, like say the PC finds the keys to the prison cells; whereas a "no, but" could mean the guard is not knocked out but something good happens, like say he didn't get the chance to sound the alarm.<br/><br/>Most games use a randomizer to determine success/failure and many also use a randomizer to determine severity, if needed. If you're only rolling for severity, ie only variations of yes, I don't really see the point of rolling at all.</blockquote>\nMy point being: the "Yes, but" is (or, in my opinion, always should be handled as) a fall forward mechanic. It's practically the same thing as a fail, because what you've done is replacing the first obstacle with a new one.<br/><br/>Lets take the guard in front of the door as an example. The player wants to knock out the guard, rolls, describes how it's done but the game master may add.<br/><br/><div>"Yes, but the door behind the guard is locked."<br/>"Yes, but the guard manage to sound the alarm."</div><br/>This will create a nice flow between the players and the game master, where one takes the initiative and the other one responds by giving that idea a spin. I will direct the following to <a href="/forums/profile/Carpediem">@Carpediem</a> too. A few months ago, we talked about action in roleplaying games and a technique was talked about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/421490#Comment_421490" rel="nofollow">that the character doesn't suck</a>, it's just the other person that's that good.

The collaborative feel of Fiasco is absolutely the direction I want to go. The and/but results mean something cool has happened in the story (positive or negative for the players) and it's up to everyone to decide what specifically that will be, based on the scene, and how it plays out. So it's not going to be just for the GM to dictate what happens. The intent is for the table to start tossing ideas around about what this could be, and settle on something cool. Like a writer's room. "What about this?" "That could be cool, but what about this?"<br/><br/>Default state of fail. I never said it was, but failure should be an option. Not the default, not the majority, no; but as an actual possibility, yes. And as you say, the character doesn't necessarily suck because they rolled a failure, it can easily be described as their opponent or obstacle was simply too tough, better than, circumstances entirely out of their control, or whatever. Two characters face off against each other and they both roll a simple no. They're evenly matched. Neither can gain the advantage. It's a stalemate. They exist in proper stories, I see no reason to eliminate their possibility in game play.<br/><br/>"Fail forward". I get where you're trying to go with that, but I disagree with the basic premise. Failure can be fun too. That failure being described as the character being a nob, isn't. But that's not what the dice determine. The dice determine success/failure along with maybe a kicker. The player and the table describe the why and how of that failure. "Yes, but" is an explicitly different result than "no, but", but each can kick the story forward. One is a success at cost, the other is a failure with a perk. Very different things.<br/><br/>From your example of the guard in front of the door. The PC's goal is to take out the guard.<br/><br/>Yes, but... The PC <i>knocks out</i> the guard, <i>but</i> something bad happens. As determined by the table.<br/>No, but... The PC <i>does not knock out</i> the guard, <i>but</i> something good happens. As determined by the table.<br/><br/>If you eliminate the possibility of actually failing at the primary goal, ie removing no as a possible result, you cut off several avenues of story. You eliminate failure entirely. You will never fail to achieve your stated goal, at worst it will just come at a cost. Granted, "yes, but" is fun, however "no, but" is fun too. If there aren't any no results, you will always hurt the guard. There's no possibility he remains unharmed. What is gained by closing that off as a possibility?<br/><br/>What it should be like is...<br/><br/>GM sets the scene.<br/>Any characters in the scene set their goals.<br/>Player: "I want to subdue the guard."<br/>Rolls no, but...<br/>Everyone at the table offers ideas.<br/>Player describes his character's actions throughout the scene.<br/>The table describes the NPC's actions throughout the scene.<br/>Some bit of description catches everyone as potentially cool so they use that to bring in the "but".<br/>The player describes the moment of his failure based on the various ideas floated around the table.<br/>The table talks about what happens next.<br/>GM sets the next scene...<br/><br/>The dice only determine the resolution of the goal within a given scene. The specifics are always left to the player and the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426699/#Comment_426699" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T16:18:40+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  4:18PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2014 4:20PM by Rickard.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you're describing is the common way of doing it.

Of the various storytelling structures, television seems the most accessible and easy to convey. Most one-hour dramas have four acts with an optional teaser and/or tag. The act breaks typically follow the commercial breaks and this structure can handle anything from purely episodic (one-shot stories) to a serial narrative. That and there's a lot of games that center around role-playing in TV show universes, so emulating that structure from the ground up seems like a benefit.</blockquote>This sounds interesting!

A new thread would be great!<br/><br/>liblarva, are you familiar with any of the other games which try to follow a "story formula", like unWritten and maybe Final Hour of a Storied Age?<br/><br/>As for the resolution topic:<br/><br/><br/>1. Apocalypse World and the miss<br/><br/>Some people were confused by my options in the Apocalypse World breakdown. It's simple: on a miss, the MC makes a move. Everyone would find it pretty weird if the MC chose a move which was a positive outcome for the character, but there's lots of room for "Yes, but" type resolutions.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>A character tries to <i>manipulate</i> a powerful crime lord into letting him into the inner lair of the Criminal Council. She misses the roll!<br/><br/>The MC could say:<br/><br/>A. No, and. "You don't get your way. The crime lord is really pissed off, and has you arrested!" <br/>B. No, but. "You don't get your way. But the crime lord lets slip that he is looking for a rare item. If you could find it for him, maybe he would reconsider?" <br/>C. Yes, but. "The crime lord agrees, and leads you into the chamber of the Council. You find yourself face-to-face with the evil Emperor... and realize that he is your father!" Or, simpler: "The crime lord agrees, and leads you into the chamber. When you enter the room, he grins and says, 'I've brought her here, Lords. The sacrificial lamb we've been waiting for...' There's lots of evil cackling all around. What do you do now?"<br/><br/>Or, simpler yet, "Ok, I'll let you in. But only if you turn in your lover! Mwahaha!"<br/><br/>The "no" option seems pretty uninteresting, so it's not used, in my experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2. Conflicts under a d6-yes-and-scale can go a number of different ways. Here are a few which come to mind:<br/><br/>* Simply don't allow players to state goals which oppose each other. If I say I want to get the deed from the safe, you can't say that your goal is to stop me. Your goal will be something else, which makes the scene more interesting.<br/><br/>This is best if your efforts have some impact on the outcome of the other player's roll. Maybe having an opponent is always treated like rolling from a position of disadvantage, for example.<br/><br/>* Use another mechanic to resolve ties. For instance, if you have some kind of in-game resource, the players involved could spend or gamble it to resolve the tie. Maybe you can win on a tie by agreeing to sit out the next scene, for example. Or maybe you can get some extra resource/bonus/advantage by agreeing to back down on a tie. (See IaWA's "we Owe list" for inspiration.)<br/><br/>* Use ties as an opportunity to complicate the conflict. Under this model, a character only gets what they want in an opposed conflict if they get a "yes" result AND their opponent gets a "no" result.<br/><br/>In this case, a tie can be used for various effects:<br/><br/>a) A tie indicates a cliffhanger. We cut to another scene, and come back to this scene later.<br/>b) A tie means that the conflict escalates. The characters must push ahead to raise the stakes of the conflict or give in and let the other person win. Two matched boxers draw knives on each other, a criminal who can't evade the pursuing detective decides to take the chase into dangerous territory (like Han Solo flying into the asteroid field to escape the Imperials), and so on.<br/>c) A tie means that neither party gets what they want, because some other force intervenes, turning the scene into something else, interrupting the conflict. The arena of conflict changes due to some unexpected element! Two warriors fighting to the death fall off the cliff and find themselves in a river infested by crocodiles. Etc. The conflict is not resolved and a new situation now exists.<br/>d) A tie means that the characters must sacrifice or risk something they value. How much will this fight cost them? Effectively, the "price" of this conflict has just gone up. You may win, but it will cost you more than you expected. This can be fictional or mechanical (you lose points, traits, resources, etc) - in some older "indie" games you can win a conflict, but only at the cost of losing a relationship you had, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426710/#Comment_426710" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T17:26:46+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  5:26PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2014 5:28PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a link for <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a>, which Paul just mentioned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426728/#Comment_426728" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T20:47:23+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  8:47PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah.

Any rolling is done by the player of the elf, based on what they're trying to accomplish in the face of the orc's action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426834/#Comment_426834" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T07:23:41+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  7:23AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's easy to do for opposition from outside (i.e. from the GM, for example), but you need to give some thought to how it works when two PCs are competing against each other, which is what I was talking about, above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426839/#Comment_426839" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T07:46:23+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  7:46AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, gotcha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426856/#Comment_426856" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T11:31:50+00:00" title="January  8, 2014 11:31AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it would work any differently with PC vs NPC or PC vs PC. If all the opposition is doing is trying to stop the active character, just let the active character roll. A failure on their part indicates the opposition won. If the opposing force is a player keen on rolling too, they can come up with something more interesting to do than "I try to stop him."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
