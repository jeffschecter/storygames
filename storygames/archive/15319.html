What's your experience?  Do you still see it even though you've passed through the glass celing?<br/><br/>Lisa Stevens:<br/><a href="/forums/profile/Marsha">@Marsha</a> - Oh, most definitely.  The only way I got through the glass ceiling is by starting my own game companies.  And even then, as they got bigger, I got marginalized.  The Hobby Game Industry hall of fame only has two women in it.  Liz Danforth and Julie Guthrie.  Guys who worked with me at my various companies are in the Hall, but not me.  How much more of a resume do you need?  I assume that if I was a guy, I would be in the Hall already.</blockquote>\nIt should be noted that Lisa worked at high level positions in White Wolf, Wizard of the Coast, and is CEO of Paizo which currently has the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> RPG in the US, France, and Italy (#2 in Germany).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
