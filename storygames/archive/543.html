<p>So in <em>Capes</em> one of the best things I can bring to the table is my intent to play the game with passion and excitement, pursuing my own goals even when it gets me screwed.</p>
<p>This is leading by example.  People see "Oh, wow, Tony is doing this stuff that looks like ten liters of refined liquid fun.  The stuff he's doing is clearly working.  He's having <em>more fun than me</em>, the bastard!  Well I'll show him!  I'll go out there and have TWENTY liters of supersaturated fun," and then they go out there any play for all their worth and we all have a ball.</p>
<p>But part of that is because I'm showing them how it can be done.  I am doing what they could do.  They know they can do it because they're in the same position that I'm in.</p>
<p>Can a GM do that?  I'm not at all sure.  I mean ... there are many ways in which the players are <strong>not</strong> in the same position as the GM.  They can look at a GM having more fun than five barrels of monkeys, and not get the idea that <em>they too</em> could be having a lot of fun.</p>
<p>The more I think about this the sadder it seems.</p>

                            I think a GM can do this very easily -- I don't think it's particularly about GM/player at all, but about the roles people play in their social groups. In many gaming groups, the social leader is the GM, and part of his or her job is to get everyone else psyched up with over-the-top performances, descriptions, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Except, of course, that sometimes that person acts to squash player engagement. Which is generally less true, in my limited experience, with games with no obvious GM. But you would know better than I.                        </div>

                            Outside of like, roundrobin GMing schemes, I'm thinking, no, categorically, a GM can't show a player how to better enjoy being a player by modeling that behavior.  If the GM did so, he wouldn't be the GM, or he'd be running one of those GM-pseudo-characters, and even then players can easily assume he's doing awesome things because he's the GM and he's giving "his PC" unfair breaks.<br/><br/>That's not to say, though, that there's no way for the GM to show players how to enjoy themselves in the game.  One of the best examples I can think of this is your example from running Dogs, and enticing players to use their Book of Life 2d8 to beat somebody over the head.  They're not doing the same thing you're doing, but you can still show/guide/lead/tell them how to enjoy what they're doing.<br/><br/><b>Caveat:</b> if you atomize the things happening at the table, as James pointed out, the GM can model some things, like performance standards and descriptions.  In games that allow players to reward each other and recognize the GM as a player, this also happens -- giving the Director Fan Mail, for instance.                        </div>

<p>I dunno if it's ever possible to "lead by example" if by "example" you mean "big pushy challenge to act equally pushy" simply because the players and GM have different options for action.</p>

                            I think you can define leadership as the moving people towards a shared goal.  If the shared goal is only to have fun, and the players aren't having fun, then the GM isn't being an effective leader.  To lead by example, a GM can be fair, a GM can stick to the rules, a GM can behave in all types of ways that lead to fun and effective play.  And it doesn't have just to be for fun.  <br/>
Not all people are effective leaders, so it's probably not a GM leadership thing, but a who is the GM leadership thing.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  As a person who GMs most of the time, I know you cna lead by example. In fact, I think that is where a lot of GMs go wrong. They try and reward or punish players. Rather than lead by example.<br/>
  If you want people to use team tactics, you, the GM, needs to use team tactics. If you want siloquies, use siloquies, if you want narrative roleplaying, narrate and roleplay, etc...<br/>
  I follow that advice and it works well for me.<br/>

                            I think there are lots of ways to lead by example.  Excitement, enthusiam are contagious; so is their lack.  The GM can also flag what is and isn't important.  "OK, you travel another day throughthe wilderness, mark off another day's rations from everybody's sheet" is a big Leaving Now flag for me.  If that's what the GM cares about, it's just the wrong game for me.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there is the issue of "why should just on player be privledged to set the agenda for the group?" but that's a whole 'nother post.                        </div>

                            Huh.  I'm a marginally-traditional GM, and I totally lead by example.  I can't model exactly what I want the players doing, because I've got a slightly larger scope, but I can model what I find to be interesting situations (and then let them create situations that I have to react to), and what I find to be interesting characters (and then challenge them to play their characters in equally interesting ways), and what I find to be effective portrayal of scenes (and then give them fantastically juicy opportunities to throw the very same thing back to me).<br/><br/>For me, a game is a collaboration between me, any other GMs, and the players - and our game scribe (who rocks!) and any observers that we happen to have (usually two to four).  I can model appropriate collaborative behavior and narrative approaches without actually having to take the exact same roles as the players have.  I can't model how to be a good player, because I'm not one, but I can demonstrate my expectations for our shared game, and offer opportunities for players to engage at the same level.  I'm a GM because my players want me to do more of the conflict-creation and world-building work, but I see my role as an equal partner, just one with a bigger toolbox.  I can't show the players how to use my tools, nor can they model for me how to use theirs, because we have different roles - but that isn't going to stop us from building a damn fine birdhouse together.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>What just came to mind: the GM can lead by example in terms of the fiction (and that's all fair, so long as the players have the tools to pursue those same goals in the game). So, in Dogs, I could show them a glimpse of a Watchdog has created a large amount of social unrest in the course of his job, while pursuing his own agenda for change. (A rogue Dog with a communist manifesto!) The game gives them the tools to take this character down this path, if they like, and I'm showing that in the Dogsverse, as we see it, this is something that could happen.</p>
