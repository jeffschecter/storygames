We did a Hangouts-on-Air thing, and a few people watched. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D68udqD3Szo" rel="nofollow">It's now on YouTube</a>, because Hangouts-on-Air does that.<br/><br/>Is that the sort of thing anyone's interested in watching? For some of my research, when I was still in grad school, I went through a few hours of recorded play, and I found it <em>insanely</em> boring post-hoc. I think it's really an in-the-moment kind of thing. But there are probably folks who disagree, and do find it interesting!<br/><br/>I'm thinking that it might be worthwhile to do some live examples-of-play for games that I like or am making at some point, in addition, of course, to participatory playtests with varied-and-far-flung folks.

I do enjoy AP podcasts, though, because I can listen to them while I do routine activities like taking long walks. I usually find them entertaining (if the group has good chemistry) and informative in that it lets me observe different people's approaches to games, what does and doesn't seem to work in the game, etc. I find that AP podcasts based on things like Skype play are usually the easiest to absorb, because while they're playing they need to make sure all of the relevant stuff gets communicated verbally to each other (which also means the audience hears it) and don't rely on nonverbal stuff (facial expressions, pointing at maps, etc.) which doesn't work well on radio.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383185/#Comment_383185" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T15:29:49+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  3:29PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Dan puts his finger on the difference in approaches/audiences for different materials. I also enjoy Actual Play podcasts, but only in that context. If I'm focused on them, they're kind of boring. If I'm doing something else, downtime/development time/people doing things I don't really care about are features, not bugs, because I can use that time to focus on what I'm doing/make decisions about it. Like, I've had a lot of suggestions that we should make Out of Character an actual play podcast.  That doesn't seem interesting to me and the person editing it would have a nightmare in making it a focused production - but focus is itself not a desirable thing when you're on a hour long hike.

Besides good lighting, microphones, and editing, you also need to make sure that everyone at the table is not only comfortable in front of a camera/microphone, but also <i>entertaining to an audience</i>.<br/><br/>This might mean that you can't just use the folks who show up to your weekly game. (Okay, it almost certainly means you can't do that, but who knows? Maybe you game with unusually photogenic, charismatic people.) And it means someone's going to have to put a lot of money into getting the equipment, and a lot of time into setting things up right. And then, because you're not Internet Famous or whatever, no one will watch it anyway. Man, it's hard to catch a break in this mean ol' world.<br/><br/><br/>*Mind you, their <i>Fiasco</i> episode has yet to go up, so I don't know how interesting/sensible an RPG session would be in that format. Boardgames and card game seem to do okay, because an audience doesn't have to care about every move and you can just cut straight to the good bits. Having that narrative element in there seems like it would complicate that, but I guess we'll see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383194/#Comment_383194" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T17:00:50+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  5:00PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2012 5:01PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tabletop is going to do pretty much exactly what I suggest above - we won't see the entire game from beginning to end, with the diversions, interruptions, and rabbit trails.

I wouldn't have stayed watching it for the first 2+ hours if not for that -- because I was not just passively engaged. I took notes and chimed in when I saw some errors in play (and then took more notes on that).<br/><br/>That said, I know a lot of AP podcasters who get good hits. There are people who use that either to learn, to get their "fix" in when they can't for whatever reason game themselves, or to kill time. But like Dan &amp; Jason say, there's a difference to being tied to a screen and wandering around with your MP3 player or using it to pass the time on a long commute.<br/><br/>I've thought hard about tutorial videos for Mythender, but I don't have the time to produce them. They wouldn't be spontaneous play, but an illustrative, scripted example. Different beast, but like with Tabletop, the one that serves a particular goal that random AP shows don't really do.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383196/#Comment_383196" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T17:10:53+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  5:10PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2012 5:11PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cross-posted)<br/><br/>I'm hoping that Tabletop's pieces-to-camera are going to provide a good way of compressing the Fiasco episode's narrative together, linking the fun 'play out the scene' bits together by watching funny people/awesome writers summarise what happened in between those moments.<br/><br/>That 'summarising' technique (which provides the commentary and context that Jason just mentioned) could be part of a good way to present Actual Play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383198/#Comment_383198" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T18:09:11+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  6:09PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It totally would be, but time spend producing polished stuff from hours of raw audio is not small. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383199/#Comment_383199" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T18:22:58+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  6:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so next question:<br/><br/>I think a lot about sets-of-binaries defining a space (blame Chomsky and Halle, <em>The Sound Patterns of English</em>). So one of the sets-of-binaries I think about is in media: interactive/audience-based, verbal/visual, episodic/singleton, <strong>edited/improvisational</strong>. That last one is relevant here.<br/><br/>RPGs are improvisational, and I think that a lot of what I'm seeing in the responses\u2014and feeling in my own response to the idea of watching play\u2014is that if we're going to sit through something, and not take part in the creation, we'd rather it be edited.<br/><br/>And yet, I can enjoy watching theatrical improv (though it doesn't hold a candle to actually doing it). So do you think it's possible to make an RPG session be as fun to watch as that? I mean, sure, <em>Who's Line is it Anyway</em> is actually edited (but also arguably not very good), but I'm thinking like local improv seen live.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383203/#Comment_383203" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T20:19:45+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  8:19PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd rather eat my own skin than watch improv on video. <br/><br/>Most of the same constraints apply, and a professionally-edited two camera piece could probably be great, but without those resources you get <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9yYcI_aX8" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which is pretty harsh.

I've quite happily sat through six performances of the same show on consecutive evenings, but would struggle to watch it off tape without zoning out. (It's all part of what keeps live theatre in business)<br/><br/>Anything on video, especially on the web, needs to be fast-paced and visually interesting. Yahtzee of Zero Punctuation springs to mind as someone successfully pushing that to the extreme.<br/><br/>The one, largely static, story-based tv show that I recall is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackanory" rel="nofollow">Jackanory</a>, which did what it did well (again with the provisio of professionals working under professional conditions). Episodes were only 15 mins though and relied on a smooth flow of story-telling which doesn't happen under gaming conditions (though it might be an interesting way to do an AR) and also, by not having much happening visually, allowed it to be treated like radio.<br/><br/>As commented above, short, snappy and visually interesting examples of rules and game concepts are probably the best use of video.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
