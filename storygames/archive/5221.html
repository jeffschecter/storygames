I lucked out.  I'm going shopping in the nano-edged distant future, and I can't wait!  Thing is, I can only bring back myself - that's how the future works.  So I want to get some kick-ass implants, symbiotes and modifications while I am there.  I'm looking for suggestions.<br/><br/>Here's what's on my list:<br/><br/>* Something to manage my autoimmune system, keep me free of infection, and manage injury speedily<br/>* Something to make me amazingly alert, strong, tough, fast, and so forth in short, exhausting bursts<br/>* Something to let me communicate silently with other implant-holders, like machine telepathy<br/>* Something to handle communication - language acquisition (this is big in the future) and translation<br/>* Something to prod my brain into unleashing kick-ass psychic powerz!  (Apparently this is available).<br/>* Something to keep track of everything I have ever experienced and manage a gigantic reference library in my head!<br/>* Something that can act as an expert system and teach me something useful over time, and offer advice, or just take over and do it<br/><br/>So what sort of cool stuff am I missing?  They'll assume I know what I want - nobody hands you a catalog in the future (which I am reliably told looks a lot like a Charles Stross novel).  I'm not made of money, so I need sensible, practical, and extremely useful stuff I can use to augment my already awesome self.  Also, I'm not interested in turning my hands into plasma guns or anything creepy - I have to live in the 21st century, after all.  Any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

Will you guys rate these, both column A and column B, in terms of how cool and fun they are going to be, from best to worst?  What's the coolest thing and what's the lamest in each column?  Thanks!  (Commensals are synthetic symbiotic organisms, powerful but fussy)<br/><br/><b>COLUMN A:  COMMENSALS</b><br/><br/>1.  Ghost:  The Commensal remembers every experience the host has ever had and retrieves information, sensations, or memories effortlessly on command.  It also contains the equivalent of a 100 terabyte reference library.  As an added benefit, they are able to provide an additional set of senses, as a sort of situational \u201crunning commentary\u201d when asked \u2013 and sometimes without being asked.<br/><br/>2.  Medical:  The Commensal completely prevents infection and allows healing from injuries at ten times normal speeds.  You\u2019ll also age one day for every four.  People who use medical Commensals long-term tend to develop a smooth, unnatural appearance, with skin the color and texture of the inside of a mucus membrane.<br/><br/>3.  Psi:  The Commensal provides access to psychic potential.  Every host will have a single aptitude \u2013 telepathy (mind reading, mind control) , psychokinesis (telekinesis, pyrokinesis), or ESP (Precognition and remote viewing).  You never know what your aptitude is until the Commensal turns it on \u2013 it\u2019s more or less random.  Psi Commensals are notoriously fragile, and their lifespans are directly proportional to the modesty of their application.<br/><br/>4.  Savant:  The Commensal is highly intelligent, and is an expert in one focused discipline, such as atmospheric piloting, the viola, or signals intelligence.  It can perform simple tasks of any sort free of direction.  One could, for example, gradually build a boat while the host slept every night.  Savant Commensals are extremely useful but put more pressure on the host than other types, demanding new and interesting tasks with increasing complexity and responsibility.  They are excellent watchdogs, too, but are not for the lazy or careless.  <br/><br/>5.  Perceptive:  The Commensal augments ordinary human senses and adds one of its own \u2013 electroception, which allows the host to sense the presence of, and changes to, electrical fields.  It can also generate weak fields for sub-rosa communication with other electroceptors.  The acuity of all other senses, including proprioception (leading to enhanced reaction times), is effectively doubled when selectively engaged.   Perceptive Commensals demand to be used, which can become awkward, irritating, or even painful over time.<br/><br/><b>COLUMN B:  IMPLANTS</b><br/><br/>1.  Metabolic:  The implant coordinates organ function, leading to supranormal efficiency.  Toxins are safely assimilated more or less instantly, input needs are halved (including oxygen and calories), and all metabolism-dependent functions are effectively doubled in effectiveness.  <br/><br/>2.  Crisis:  Also known as the \u201capeshit\u201d implant, this series of augmentations take effect when triggered, or by default when specific criteria are met.  The host blacks out and a special forces expert system takes control as physiological responses are cranked past the breaking point \u2013 the host becomes a lethal killing machine with tripled strength, agility and endurance for approximately fifteen minutes.  Activation of a crisis implant will invariably kill a Commensal.<br/><br/>3.  Persuasion:  These highly illegal implants contain a pheromone-specific nanofactory, capable of producing an enormous array of tailored odors to seduce, convince, and terrify.  <br/><br/>4.  Voice:  The implant allows near-real-time language acquisition and acts as a \u201cpre-processor\u201d for translation in any language.

Quadrupling my lifespan? Never get sick again? <b>Yes</b> please. Also, <i>hypothetically</i>, if I expect to be visiting some backwater world where they fight with swords and don't believe in such things as sanitization, that whole resist-infection thing would be very, very, very handy. But that's just hypothetically and doesn't have any bearing to the choices being made in this situation, right? It's still very cool, and addresses real and deep concerns of mine.<br/><br/>Ghost is a strong second. The perfect memory thing is cool, but the 100-terabyte reference library in my head is cooler. I mean, I use wikipedia all the time, and the idea of the future's more reliable, even more extensive version of that, would be fairly awesome. And 100 terabytes! That's <i>huge.</i> It could almost replace Medical, what with my extensive knowledge of all things health-related. But not really.<br/><br/>The other ones are cool, but they seem like the drawbacks would start to get annoying. Perceptive and Psi would largely come down to how large of an issue it really is. I don't want one of my only two cool tricks wigging out on me and leaving me high and dry, but nor do I want some voice in my head going "SET YOURSELF ON FIRE TO SEE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE KTHXBYE." As for the Savant Commensal, well, the entire reason I enjoy technology is that it allows me to be Lazy and Careless, so, y'know, that one gets the short end of the list. But it's still pretty cool.<br/><br/><br/>Column B:<br/><br/>Voice! Voice! Voice! A huge, scary, percent of my coworkers are always jabbering away in Spanish or Chinese or stuff like that, and I would love to be able to talk to them, but burden under the curse of monolingualism regardless. And ventriloquism AND flawless voice imitation are two hilarious tricks that become exponentially more hilarious together. The voice implant is nothing but win.<br/><br/>Persuasion. I'm an introvert, and not good at small talk or things like that, so being able to fake it effortlessly to cover up that skill deficiency is tempting. And it doesn't seem to come with any nasty drawbacks, aside from the whole hideous illegality thing. And what does that matter back here in the past?<br/><br/>Metabolic seems to cover the same ground as Medical. It doesn't have the long-term cosmetic drawback associated with it, but seems like it doesn't do quite as impressive an amount. Could still be handy, but if I only had two things to choose, I don't think it would be high enough on my list.<br/><br/>I try to solve my problems nonviolently, so Monster and Crisis would, honestly, almost never be worth their drawbacks to me. Even if I were the action-hero type, stuck on a world with more inescapably violent situations than my current one, It seems like it would be much much more effective to Persuasion my way out of problems than, you know, <b>look like a freak</b> or <b>kill my commensual.</b> If I were going to take one, which one is worse depends on whether or not I actually have any Commensuals, of course.<br/><br/>So if I could only grab two? Voice and Medical, probably. I might be tempted to get Voice and Ghost, but I'd really regret Ghost 50 years down the road or so, when I'm old and dying, and they're still 100 years away from solving that problem. If I expected a lot of short-term threats to survival for some reason, Voice and Crisis, and I could laugh away the Crisis drawback with my total lack of Commensuals. As I'm, y'know, fugue-murdering everyone around me any time my nose bleeds. Cough.<br/><br/>But if the short-lifespan problem were addressed, Voice and Psi would be a no-brainer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118041/#Comment_118041" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-04T21:01:04+00:00" title="January  4, 2008  9:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Working off my admittedly feeble knowledge of real science, Metabolic and Medical both look similar and both do two things.<br/><br/>Aging happens because of this doomahicky thing in living cells. It gets turned on or whatever and aging happens. When scientists figure out how to turn that process off, which could happen within our lifetimes (or so I have been assured), people will stop aging, and instead will die from a build-up of heavy metals and toxic pollutants after a few hundred years (like 500 is not out of the question). In the future, I think everybody has this - automatic instead of a given. But who knows? We haven't invented it yet, so...<br/><br/>A device that manages your immune system would be, as they say "boss." You can't just destroy bacteria, cause you need the stuff you have inside you already, and that stuff will kill you if your immune system falls apart (from say, the HIV virus, or lack of sleep). So maximizing your body's equilibrium wouldn't stop you from aging, but it would make you super-fit and healthy. It wouldn't filter out poisons and stuff you ingest, but it would keep you safe from viruses and bacteria, including infections of wounds. And you would heal faster (although starving would hinder that effect).<br/><br/>100 terabytes is huge?<br/>Did you know! At the current rate of data transfer, the time it would take to transfer the information of one human being onto discs would take... 30 billion years.<br/><br/><br/>Also, Jason, have you read The Darkness That Comes Before, by R. Scott Bakker? One of the main characters is pretty much what you're writing about - superhuman perceptions and computer-brain (but not "magical") in a fantasy setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118043/#Comment_118043" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-04T21:11:31+00:00" title="January  4, 2008  9:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That said, Metabolic is pretty good.

And calling your parents or whoever is just like having a comensal that will talk to you, right?<br/><br/>But you could replace "100 terabtes" with "quantum-entangled communications that allow you to access information somewhere else" and it would be way cooler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118089/#Comment_118089" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T12:58:02+00:00" title="January  5, 2008 12:58PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking along the lines of having a secure, instantaneous link to the outside world if I was, say, stranded on a primitive planet somewhere.
