Basically a guy made up these various elements of a workout into a playing card deck, so that you can mix up your routine a lot for personal challenge and to maintain interest. I pitched a few dollars in, hopefully it'll get funded:<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getfitstayingfit/getfitsu-card-game-making-fitness-fun?ref=live" rel="nofollow">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getfitstayingfit/getfitsu-card-game-making-fitness-fun?ref=live</a><br/><br/><b>* Fitocracy</b> basically combines the social and goal-oriented elements of a Massive Multiplayer Online RPG or other online console games ("levels", "achievements", even "quests"!). It encourages people to exercise, provides them with little social rewards for doing so (badges/achievements for things like running a 5k, bench-pressing your weight, etc). They are trying to take the addictive elements of a social online game, and using them for good to help folks exercise and push themselves more. There's been a bit of buzz on it in the tech world: <br/><br/>(with pictures of the developers and their stories)<br/><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/14/health/video-gamers-bodybuilders-fitocracy/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/14/health/video-gamers-bodybuilders-fitocracy/index.html</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2011/09/16/the-body-hackers-behind-the-scenes-at-fitocracy-the-addictive-fitness-game-that-will-make-you-want-to-work-out/" rel="nofollow">http://www.betabeat.com/2011/09/16/the-body-hackers-behind-the-scenes-at-fitocracy-the-addictive-fitness-game-that-will-make-you-want-to-work-out/</a><br/><br/>Fitocracy is currently in Beta (I'm digging it, especially the "Quests" aspect, but I've only been on it for about two days now), keep an eye on it if it eventually opens up.<br/><br/>Anyway, just some cool stuff to watch.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348574/#Comment_348574" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T10:20:05+00:00" title="November 10, 2011 10:20AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, forgot to add:<br/><br/>Fitocracy has "levels". Like D&amp;D and other games, the levels are kinda exponential (easier to hit level 2 from 1 than 6 from 5).<br/><br/>Way back in the day, in the 3E/3.5E heyday, I was visualizing a "Fitness d20" project where you basically tracked exercises, gained experience, and that experience could then apply to your D&amp;D character. Unfortunately, I couldn't pull it off: Fitness is too varied per exercise that I couldn't scale between say "weightlifting" and "yoga" and "running" without going from the ground up in each realm (and to me the project was useless if it only was about weightlifting, or only about martial arts), unless I turned the research on it into a day-job or something (which the Fitocracy guys did). <br/><br/>So through Fitocracy, you gain levels for doing more and varied exercises. You get points (towards levels) for completing "quests", things like "run a mile!" "do a 5k!" "do a set of squats!" "bench press 135!", or "Achievements (which are much more difficult, things like "100 accumulated mile runs!") etc.<br/><br/>(as an aside, I think that martial arts need to be nerfed a little; I went from level 1 to level 5 in one step from 2 hours of normal aikido. Felt a little cheap. I changed it to "1 hour", figuring that was the actual time I spent in the air, being dragged across the floor, swinging wooden swords and sweating like a monster, which still bumped me from level 1 to level 4 in one step. Still, I'm going to aim for those achievements).<br/><br/>I was thinking that the d20 (read: Pathfinder) idea is still accessible now that Fitocracy has done all the heavy lifting. Two thoughts on the idea:<br/><br/>(using 3e, 3.5e, or Pathfinder):<br/><br/>1) At the beginning of every session, log your Fitocracy level on your sheet. You add that level to every single roll you make with the d20 (it's your "additional level bonus"; skills, attacks, saving throws, etc).<br/><br/>2) Same as above, but instead of a flat number (if that's too big of a boost in your mind), change it to a die roll.<br/><br/>(FL = Fitocracy Level; DL = Die Roll)<br/><br/>FL - DL<br/>1   -   +1<br/>2   -   1d2<br/>3   -   1d3<br/>4   -   1d4<br/>5   -   1d4+1<br/>6   -   1d6<br/>7   -   1d6+1<br/>8   -   1d8<br/>9   -   1d8+1<br/>10   -  1d10<br/>11   -   1d10+1<br/>12   -   2d6<br/>13   -   2d6+1<br/>14   -   1d10+1d4<br/>15   -   1d10+1d4+1<br/>16   -   2d8<br/>17   -   2d8+1<br/>18   -   1d10+1d8<br/>19   -   1d10+1d8+1<br/>20   -   2d10<br/>etc<br/><br/>(yeah, I liked the "stepped dice" mechanic from Earthdawn. Though for sake of promoting awesomeness, I'd probably first playtest with simply adding the Fitocracy level to each die roll)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348576/#Comment_348576" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T10:36:37+00:00" title="November 10, 2011 10:36AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>[...]yeah, I liked the "stepped dice" mechanic from Earthdawn</blockquote> You're a monster, Andy. I can't believe I'm internet friends with an Action Diceist.<br/><br/>But seriously, I think this is an interesting starting direction. The thing that I don't like about it is that it divorces the mechanic (working out) from the fiction (killing goblins and taking their stuff). Is there any way to connect them more closely? A sports- or fitness-themed color that might justify the connection? Powers in the fiction that are connected to the particular achievements you get in Fitocracy? So maybe every "Run a mile!" gives you a one-shot bonus to a CON-based roll, and "Accumulate 100 mile runs!" gives you +2 CON, or something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348579/#Comment_348579" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T11:06:26+00:00" title="November 10, 2011 11:06AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.superbetter.com/" rel="nofollow">Superbetter</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348588/#Comment_348588" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T12:04:41+00:00" title="November 10, 2011 12:04PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Powers in the fiction that are connected to the particular achievements you get in Fitocracy?

However, for me this would not be like taking a group of already fit people and adding rules to an existing d20 game. It would likely intro with something like (as applies to friends in my local gaming groups); "Look. We're all in our 30s. We're not getting any younger. We keep saying "Man, I really need to get in shape", and while we're eating slightly healthier gaming foods, we really aren't pushing ourselves. Let's aim to improve ourselves, and instead of 'checkpoints', we'll play some D&amp;D. The goals that we've made during those 2-3 weeks of time in between sessions will express themselves in-game as rewards. Do more out there in the real world, and you get that much more powerful in game. Gains in power in the real world become gains in power of your fantasy character, even above and beyond the game's inherent game-based knowledge and rewards."<br/><br/>If I can get me and my friends to go, "Shit, I can't watch three hours of downloaded serial dramas tonight; I need to do pushups, crunches, lunges and a mile run in order to level up: We're going against that dragon in just four days!" Then it will have been totally worth it!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348596/#Comment_348596" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T13:31:37+00:00" title="November 10, 2011  1:31PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EKHDhxlcxVyNaazRV_SGdhAO5rks1mVJctjfNH6Z9Yk/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CI_989kO" rel="nofollow">In Training the Templar</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348597/#Comment_348597" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T13:45:17+00:00" title="November 10, 2011  1:45PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily, thanks for throwing up that link!
