I asked the poster's permission to re-post it, knowing that we had a bunch of larp-interested folks here, both Nordic and otherwise.</i><br/><br/>I'd like to invite those on this list who enjoy Live-Action Role-Playing (LARP) to participate in a special forum created for those who like to take a deeper, academic look at the LARP hobby no matter where in the world you're located. The inspiration for this list's creation came after a chat with a fellow US LARPer and academician. She shared that we had international counterparts that wanted to communicate and converse with us, however there wasn't a singular discussion medium set up just for the academic discussion of the international LARP hobby that was free from unneeded outside distractions and commentary (i.e. trolls and flamers). We also realized that there wasn't a way to easily network with those in such a way that academic discussion could occur outside of exchanging individual emails or occasionally commenting on blog or forum posts. It is my hope to remedy that through this endeavor that is just starting up (yes, this is a brand new list).<br/><br/>The mission for this list is simple: It has been created for the academic discussion and networking of members of LARP hobby across the world, regardless of genre or style. This list would be open to those taking their first steps into the academic exploration of the LARP hobby to those who've been recognized as LARP academicians. Any manner of discussion is welcome on this list, be it on theory to rules design to organizing or running a LARP with the focus being an academic exploration of the topics brought up.<br/><br/>The expectations for this list serv are simple and are as follows:<ul>\n<li>List members may be from any part of the world. Topics brought up through this list serv can be posted to any of the other lists for outside opinion should such be desired by any individual.</li>\n<li>The language of this list is English (not going to get picky on British or American, just that it be in English). Special terms may be shared in an individuals native language, but please explain them to list members in plain English, too.</li>\n<li>There is no set discussion leader. We are all leaders of the topics we start or that spin off of existing topics and as list members we are all participants in the discussions that take place. Some individuals may be more 'vocal' than others, and that is okay.</li>\n<li>Discussions on this list are to remain mature, civil and on topic. Discussions may stray from the original topic, but the key here is that conversations won't stray from the vision and list purpose. Likewise, criticism and opinions are welcome, provided they remain civil and are constructive.</li></ul>\nFor those worried about their in-box becoming buried in list emails, I don't foresee this list becoming a persistently busy list though things may surprise me. I expect activity to come and go with a flurry of messages for a few days here or there when a hot topic is brought up, otherwise I see a steady stream of a message or two per day, if that.<br/><br/>I currently have this mailing list set up on my server.

Likewise, if you prefer I add you manually to the list of subscribers please email me at mortalisrpg@mortalisrpg.com with the email address you wish me to add.<br/><br/>Thank you and game on!<br/><br/>- Amber Eagar<br/>LARP enthusiast and academician from the USA<br/><br/>P.S.
