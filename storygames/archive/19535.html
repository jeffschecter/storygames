Last I checked, it fit really well in the 2nd/3.x version of things, with a few innovations stolen from 4E (at-will spells, advantage/disadvantage being an extra die, etc.) The playtest didn't seem to have the crunchiness of 3.x or 4E, but the rules are a lot more modern than 2nd. It definitely eschews that superhero feel of 4E, but characters also aren't as helpless at earlier levels as they were in 2nd.<br/><br/>I'd recommend taking a look at Mike Mearls' Legends and Lore column during the playtest period. He had some interesting thoughts. One of the ones that definitely stood out for me was the flattening of the math curve, so that lower level characters stand a chance against higher level enemies, and lower level enemies are still a threat to higher level characters.<br/><br/>So what's it trying to be? I'd say it's trying to emulate the core what we all fondly remember D&amp;D was like years ago (whichever edition that was for you) but with a clean ruleset that takes advantage of some modern ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434309/#Comment_434309" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T20:30:21+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  8:30PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd say it's trying to emulate the core what we all fondly remember D&amp;D was like years ago (whichever edition that was for you)....</blockquote>\nThis is where I have a problem.

There's nothing about the ruleset that's too constraining to a specific playstyle, from what I can see. It's pretty much as "generic D&amp;D" as it gets. The playtest seemed to leave a lot of room for players to choose exactly how much or how little they want to engage with the system.<br/><br/>It's my understanding that the DMG is going to cover various playstyles, offering advice and optional rules for each so that DMs and players can tailor the system to their desires.<br/><br/>Whether or not the system is going to succeed at what it sets out to do is the big question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434317/#Comment_434317" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T21:57:27+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  9:57PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything that is out about it right now is marketing - in other words, everything you can read and experience about D&amp;D Next at the present time is created explicitly to destroy your knowledge and make you a worse human being.<br/><br/>Just wait until it's out, check it out, play a game or two and see if you like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434339/#Comment_434339" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T05:04:50+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  5:04AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2014 5:05AM by Rafu.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Everything that is out about it right now is <b>marketing</b> - in other words, everything you can read and experience about [TOPIC] at the present time is created explicitly to destroy your knowledge and make you a worse human being.</blockquote>\nCan I quote this brilliant definition of marketing (and spam it around the Internet in, like, every discussion about any topic known to humans)?

He was trying to make a character using the Anima Beyond Fantasy corebook, and suffering with it. Finally he tossed away the sheets and started rambling about how stressful the system wants, that despite reading the whole manual he couldn't made a simple character the way he wanted, that the system was limiting as hell, making the character felt like a stressful chore and didn't had any fun while doing it. <br/><br/>I had GMed a hack of this game for him and the rest of our group like ten years ago so, while I also found a good portion of the game un-efficient and unbalanced (which was why I ended up hacking it), I actually ended up trying to explain and defend the game. After a few moments ahead on a bit heated argument I realized we had been in that situation before, but in reverse positions. <br/><br/>He GMed a Pathfinder game for us, which I found quite stressful because of the system. I still have a sort of post traumatic stress disorder from playing 3.5 D&amp;D with a crappy railroading GM whose sessions were full of heated rule arguments and no character was playable unless it was minmaxed. Well, when my friend GMed Pathfinder he was actually doing his best to help me out of that playing style into a more relaxed one. And though he actually enjoyed the game and we had a lot of good scenes, I just couldn't fully enjoy the game, as I always felt the character wasn't fully optimized, that I was playing it wrong and he was just humoring me by letting it defeat any opponents he throwed at our group.<br/><br/>And while I was creating the character, I just felt like he was feeling now.<br/><br/>After we laugh at the situation, we finally realized what happened there. It wasn't exactly the system. I was fond of Anima because of the anime setting, the powers that went beyond limits and made grids useless, the lack of feats to be remembered to make combos and that once the character was made there was actually little need to check the rulebook for anything. All this made me able to want to understand the game (and later fix the math and simplify it's mechanics). My personal preferences are either low to no powered settings with simple systems or wild versatile overpowered anime games... with simple systems. Pathfinder and 3.5, standing in a sorta middleground with too many mechanics and rules to remember for my taste, just doesn't struck a chord for me anymore.<br/><br/>For my pal it\xb4s almost the opposite. Anime isn't his thing at all and he can actually get through the numbers to get the feel of the game. He can be watching a block os stats and actually see an organic entity with a personality, where I just can see a bunch of useless numbers.<br/><br/>So yes, in the end anyone can actually play and enjoy any game, as long as they love the setting and embrace the game philosophy. Oh yes, you can hate parts of it and never use it, but you will forgive the designers as long as you love the core of the game for what it is.<br/><br/>My advice is, take a deep breath, put a smile on your face and go find something new and shiny you can love about Next. Or just go play something you really really like. If you want help finding reasons to love it, the best one I can give you is that the core rules are what Pathfinder should be, it's 3.5 reborn with no crap in it. Advantage rules well, rules. I loved the book for it... until I readed about the classes. That crap sucks big time, or, well, it's just not my thing at all. If it were for me, I'd just play characters with no class features at all. Maybe I'd hack True 20 classes into it and that's it.<br/><br/>Good luck finding your own reasons to love it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434361/#Comment_434361" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T11:15:16+00:00" title="June 25, 2014 11:15AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The D&amp;D 5th that is or was available for playtesting is pretty focused and simple, since the crunchy combat tactics of 4th and crunchy build tactics of 3rd/Pathfinder are presumably options which haven't been released (or even finished) yet. It reminds me a bit of Basic D&amp;D in the relative simplicity and flexibility afforded to the DM. But it has some new and interesting things, perhaps the most intriguing is the way D&amp;D 5th puts the characters into the context of the world and builds explicit and implicit relationships - certainly not new but it is refreshing to see that as more core than minature combat.<br/><br/>I'm still holding out judgement for the proper release, but what I tell folks with a similar "story" bent is I expect D&amp;D 5th to be better than 3rd and 4th editions, but probably not better than 13th Age.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434362/#Comment_434362" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T11:18:15+00:00" title="June 25, 2014 11:18AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2014 11:18AM by catty_big.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Just wait until it's out, check it out, play a game or two and see if you like it.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think this is your best bet.

By the end I had left, frustrated beyond all reason at what seemed to be 3.75 The Platitude Edition. <br/><br/>I won't make a final judgement until I see a final product, but unless the game spins 180 from where it was at the end of the play testing I probably won't buy a single product or play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434380/#Comment_434380" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T16:46:14+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  4:46PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't be with me, I don't even know where I am.

Let me put it this way:<br/><br/>1. If I want a crunchy tactically-focused fantasy RPG focusing on kick-ass heroes that kick monsters in the face, I'll play 4th Edition D&amp;D. <br/><br/>2. If I want a wild, gritty, old-school slog through fantasy fucking Vietnam meets crazy sword-and-sorcery I'll play Dungeon Crawl Classics. <br/><br/>3. If I want a rules-light narratively-focused game of kick-ass heroes that kick monsters in the face, I'll play Dungeon World. <br/><br/>There is quite literally nothing in D&amp;D Next that I can't get more easily, with less bellyaching than another fantasy roleplaying system. To me, to echo Phoneix it very much seems like this:<br/><br/>"Uh...hey guys. We heard you liked Pathfinder, so um...we kinda made Pathfinder. Except with sorta-disguised mechanics from 4th edition, but made awkward and clunky and given names like "hit dice". Because we wouldn't want to call them At-Will powers or Healing Surges. Because of teh animes." <br/><br/>I too once had hopes for this edition, when I heard about simple options for playing the game your group wants to play and plans to make the fighter more than a butt-monkey for the wizard to boss. I squeed like a 12 year old girl when I saw Mearls reference DCC's Mighty Feats of Arms in his fighter description. Then it got removed, deemed "optional" content for those folks that don't want their fighters to suck. Then I looked at the playtest document and saw spells like Gate and Wish still in there. Still saying "USE ME! INVALIDATE EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE PARTY!" <br/><br/>Now I'll admit that I could be wrong. I could be that grumpy old man in the corner going "kids these days with their sex and rock and roll" but everything I've seen of this upcoming edition says otherwise. Especially the responses I've been seeing to criticisms of the system, which seem to break down to "well you don't have to use that material/just change it!" <br/><br/>*Sigh*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434403/#Comment_434403" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T07:20:33+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  7:20AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So based on the above, I guess I really hope this isn't the "avoid criticism" edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434502/#Comment_434502" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T02:33:20+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  2:33AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There is quite literally nothing in D&amp;D Next that I can't get more easily, with less bellyaching than another fantasy roleplaying system.</blockquote>\nI agree with you, mostly, believe me! And I've been disappointed with how confused the D&amp;D Next development has felt, particularly when they seem to have unlearned some of the lessons of late 3.5 and late 4e.<br/><br/>But one thing I love about D&amp;D is its syncreticism. People's idea of "generic D&amp;D" is an Arthurian knight, an 80s kung fu monk, a swords &amp; sorcery barbarian and a Vancian wizard fighting an octopus-head alien and a Hammer Horror mummy. <br/><br/>And maybe that syncreticism isn't just in its flavour. If a confused setting is the most fun D&amp;D setting, could a confused ruleset be the most fun D&amp;D ruleset? The Fate points of Spirit of the Century, a hyper-detailed domain management system, a wizard that stresses over spell components, some very specific classes and some very broad classes, etc., might boil down to the most fun game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434639/#Comment_434639" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-01T08:14:04+00:00" title="July  1, 2014  8:14AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2014 8:15AM by Kropotkin.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that one of the major design goals of this edition is creating an accessible ruleset that plays much faster than 3rd or 4th edition.  TIME seems to be the major design change here.  Faster character creation, faster fights, quicker leveling etc.  They noticed a phenomena that people who've never played D&amp;D enjoyed playing the game, but they were turned away by the crazy up front time investment that recent editions of D&amp;D require.  From what I understand you can also go from levels 1-20 within a year of regular play (which is a massive difference from ANY previous edition).  <br/><br/>For me the time it was taking to do fights and level up is what killed me enthusiasm for 4th.  It is an awesome skirmish game, but it isn't exactly what I'm looking for in a rpg.  I'm not sure 5th edition IS what I'm looking for, but I'll certainly give it a try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434671/#Comment_434671" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-01T22:29:52+00:00" title="July  1, 2014 10:29PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read some early-to-mid playtest stuff too, and agree with much of what has been said here, both pro and con. Character gen is simpler and less subject to crazy min-maxing than 4th or (especially) 3rd, the overall mechanics are pretty strong, but... it lacks focus.<br/><br/>One idea they were tossing around early on that they seem (?) to have jettisoned is the split between Combat, Interaction, and Exploration. The concept, IIRC, was that every character class would shine in a different way in each of those realms. So for example in a courtly scene the wizard might have weighty knowledge, the thief might gather secrets and rumors, the fighter would tell tales of battle, etc. It was a neat way to avoid one of the major pitfalls of... well, almost every other version of D&amp;D, really, as well as things like the Shadowrun Hacker problem. I think the only thing that's still in the game that resembles that elegance is that skills are a little more open-ended or something?<br/><br/>But anyway, here's what really got to me: they encourage GMs to fudge DCs.

In a nutshell there was edition warring, which crippled sales beyond Hasbro's patience, and this one was SUPPOSED to be a game that could be played by those that only played White Box, BECMI, AD&amp;D, 2nd, 3rd/Pathfinder, or 4th, as well as bringing new people in. <br/><br/>Now, ignoring the impossibility of that for a moment, you have to ask 'what do people enjoy, or what is iconic, about D&amp;D'? Part of that answer is going to be Rule 0, because it's fundamental to a certain playstyle which launched RPGs in the first place. Not everyone likes that style, but a large body of followers do. That means if you want a game that will attract those players, you must have that element.<br/><br/>I would separate that from the fudging die rolls thing, which is different (and more readily arguable imo).<br/><br/>As to the rest, 4th failed. Now we can argue about rather it was a design failure, a popularity failure, a marketing failure, an adherent failure, a business metric failure, etc...but if it hadn't failed there wouldn't be a 5th. You don't stop making things that are making you the money you want. That means any game which builds upon 4th (to any large degree) will meet the same failures (doesn't mean it wouldn't be wildly successful among its proponents, just not among those not interested). That's why the entire point of 5th was to look to the beginning. It was supposed to get back the players who wouldn't touch 4th (and possibly 3rd/Pathfinder) with their 10' poles.<br/><br/>Now, the problem (imo) is that you can't serve multiple masters. The people (largely) who enjoyed 4th largely weren't people who enjoyed Pathfinder, and weren't those still playing pre-3rd. If those people enjoyed the same type of game, they'd all still be playing the same games. They're not. They're playing the games that provide the experience they want. One game is not going to be able to provide experiences which differ enough to please those three groups, so the project was doomed from the beginning. I hoped. I watched. They failed. <br/><br/>I told them from the beginning: you need three game lines. Create each to serve ONLY that demographic, and abandon everything that doesn't work for those people. You'll get 3 games of ultimate popularity within their niches, and therefore 100% sales (just split between three groups/product lines). While I understand the practical reasons why they won't do this, it doesn't change the ignorant lunacy of their propaganda.<br/><br/>Oh, and 13th Age was Jonathon Tweet, who left the 5th design team. There's rampant speculation about why, and the timing. Most focused either on his intent for 13th Age, or a fallout with Mearls and/or Hasbro over the shifting of the game design. His loss of input/control is CLEARLY noticeable in the playtest versions. Up until he left the game was looking one way. The moment he left it almost instantly became 3.75 TPE (not surprising, giving Mearls &amp; Hasbro). <br/><br/>Remember that none of what I've said is making a normative judgment. I'm not saying 4th was bad, or Rule 0 is awesome, or anything else even remotely similar. I'm offering my interpretation of why things went down the way they did with the design of 5th edition.

Remember that it wasn't supposed to ONLY look to the beginning, but it was supposed to INCLUDE the beginning. Idea being to bring in each type of player to a single game.

You only get sequels if the previous version does really well.</blockquote>\nYet they only put them out to do better (sales wise). While certainly the individual designers want to refine their babies it's almost never the designers footing the bill. The company looks at profit issues and decides when sales are low enough to merit a new edition for an influx of cash (and hopefully broader consumer base). When a game is merely a refinement you can argue it's less about sales, but when the game system changes significantly it's almost certainly about attracting new players, and that boils down to $$$.<br/><br/>If you look at the time between editions (and what the company was doing during the runs) you get a pretty clear picture:<br/><br/>White Box - 3 Years - Barely enough time to write the edition after seeing that the game could sell.<br/>1st - 11 Years - An enormously long run in product terms.<br/>Basic - 23 Years (albeit over a few different editions) - HOLY FREAKING ULTIMATE PRODUCT LINE BATMAN!!!<br/>2nd - 11 Years - And again.<br/>3rd - 8 Years, split 3 &amp; 5 - Respectable overall.<br/>4th - 4 Years to start 5th design, 6 Years total run (with no new products in the last 1-2) - *cough, cough*<br/><br/>Now, obviously there's other issues that play in. The change of company hands, fluctuations of interest in rpgs, increasing corporate earning expectations, increased competition in the market, etc. But the bottom line is that 4th wasn't doing what they wanted, and I have yet to see indications that any large portion of that was system failures. It was reception/sales failures. Given the numerous 'leaked' statements by various insiders over the years (not to mention the overwhelming public butthurt) I think this is as close to fact as anything in the industry gets. The initial hoopla over 5th and its explicit goals is the nail in the coffin of such a debate. They all but said - "too many people don't like 4th and went to Pathfinder so we're making an edition to bring players back".<br/><br/>Now again, it's not that 4th is necessarily a bad game (even though I don't like it I can acknowledge its accomplishments and merits). However it IS a game that many D&amp;D players didn't like, and won't play. That part isn't opinion, and I'm sure we can agree with that. Of course it brought in new players, but obviously not enough to satisfy company metrics. <br/><br/>The truth is that it's a DIFFERENT kind of game that appeals to a DIFFERENT kind of player (just like 3rd was)...which is fine, but supports my statements and suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434716/#Comment_434716" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T12:47:04+00:00" title="July  2, 2014 12:47PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Oh, and 13th Age was Jonathon Tweet, who left the 5th design team.

But in reality, that was when the company creating it was going bankrupt and chasing a dwindling number of players.<br/><br/>Heck, look at White Wolf. 1-2 years between editions for the whole of their most successful period.<br/><br/>If D&amp;D4 was a failure, then there would be no D&amp;D5. It wasn't, so there will be.</blockquote>\nThat is so illogical I don't even know where to begin.<br/><br/>"Hey Tom, our new product is selling off the shelves. Everyone loves it and wants one. It'll take 20 years to make enough to let everyone buy one."<br/><br/>"Great Dave, immediately stop manufacture of it and lets invest all our revenue into a new product that may be loved or hated."<br/><br/>So long as a product is selling 'well' (ie meeting company goals) it stays in production. That's business 101. It's the exact opposite of what you're claiming. When a product stops meeting goals, you end the product line, or the company. You don't keep making something that isn't selling (unless you want the company, and your house/car, to go bye-bye). Monopoly would not have shelf space in stores if people weren't regularly buying the game (enough to meet company expectations of it at least). It's very likely that 2nd/basic editions exceeded their sustainable shelf life, contributing to the company decline. However lets also notice that the products released during that time are some of the most popular in the entire product line (Rules Cyclopedia continually ranks among the top products of the history of D&amp;D, and remains in high demand). Further, the company was more than one product line, and had MAJOR internal struggles during that time.<br/><br/>The product name is a success overall, and thereby rates continued investment. Hasbro is gambling that D&amp;D has name brand draw, and that all that's needed to bring players back is to change the edition to something they want more (and properly advertise/market for a change). It's no different than Harley in the 80s (or 70s or 90s, whenever the exact timeline was)...it was crap, and no one wanted the specific products they were putting out. Junk piles are full of the unsold ones. The company teetered on the edge, but they came out with new products that actually worked and that people wanted, thereby saving the company. It only worked because of brand recognition/loyalty, despite a total lemon product. However if they'd kept the same faulty products they'd have gone under.<br/><br/>Once they trust it, people will give a product a chance based on name, but they won't keep buying a bad product or one they don't want just because of the name on it. It's the product, not the name, that succeeds or fails in the end. The more popular a product is, the longer it stays on the shelves. The faster a product is ended, the worse it did (generally, though there are fervor exceptions). Chess - invented 6th century, over 3 million sets sold in the US last year (at least, not including artistic sets). Pretty damned popular. E.T. Atari 2600 - sold for ~6 months, $100 million in loss to company which failed immediately and sparked an industry-wide slump/crash. Not very popular.<br/><br/>Actually I think WoD is a good example. 1 year between initial release and 2nd (just like the short white box trial of D&amp;D). 6 years til Revised. 13 year run overall. However, what's important is that it's all largely the same game core, just with revisions. It's like 3rd to 3.5. It's NOT like 2nd to 3rd, or 3rd to 4th. So it matches or exceeds the run of 3rd/3.5, but was half the length of basic (in all its incarnations). That matches the popularity of it that I witnessed.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434723/#Comment_434723" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T14:05:52+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  2:05PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The so called "failure" can't be measured in terms of design nor in terms of the market, for in the first case there's an edition for everyone, for every kind of player. And for the later, that's the mistake the company is making: Making another edition because people are complaining, and making it on the basis of pleasing everyone, while completely losing sight of one of the most important lessons that D&amp;D has taught us along the years with it's many editions: There's too many different ways of playing RPGs that a single product can't appeal to all the players out there.<br/><br/>The result is that this is an edition for hipsters. Hipsters as in "young people who love the feeling of old stuff with new technology based on plug and play products", which is what the text and publicity have been telling me so far. And yet something tells me that hipsters would hardly play this at all. Or perhaps they'll do. Since the D&amp;D episode of Big Bang Theory, my 12 year old niece got interested in tabletop RPGs and begun to ask about them to both his teacher and lately to me. If she could get a hand on a 5th D&amp;D manual perhaps she would be playing it right now.<br/><br/>Yet her teacher told her that D&amp;D was too complex and reccomended other games (though she couldn't remember which) and I agreed. I didn't thought at all to get her into 5th. Actually my first reaction was to tell her "all you need is a dice, characters and the beginning of a story." And since in the end all she wanted was to play in the Sword Art Online setting, I told her to search their wiki for all the data she wanted. Now I'm making a game for her based on all we talked that day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434724/#Comment_434724" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T14:14:26+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  2:14PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> - right, and like I said I'm not talking about 4th (or anything) being a 'failure' as in a failure of a game...I'm talking about it failing to continue to meet sales expectations. 1st eventually failed to meet expectations, as did 2nd, 3rd, Shadowrun, etc. Almost all games do eventually. Doesn't mean they're bad games. It means they're not able to sustain the company with their current actively buying player base. <br/><br/>Just happens that 4th started 'failing' in this regard MUCH quicker than any other edition of the game, concurrent to one of the biggest product outcries in industry memory, and some of the most venomous and deeply felt angst I've ever witnessed...leading to a product designed specifically to correct that exact problem (in theory). <br/><br/>I just don't see where there's any room for doubt on those points, given the overwhelming evidence.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434727/#Comment_434727" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T14:48:22+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  2:48PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blame the internet.

I'd say that's the main reason 4th ed lasted so little compared to other editions. That and the fact that the public it was addessed to already had MMOs, and no time to keep playing too long combats, when the reason they got out of MMOs was to roleplay more.

I cannot think of a time, ever, when I was able to walk into any kind of store that sold RPG books and be told, "Sorry, all of our D&amp;D rulebooks are out of stock and back-ordered. They didn't print enough of them! Who knows when they'll be able to catch up with the demand?!" (Or be told that for any of White Wolf's games during their heyday, for that matter.) If you were anywhere near a reasonably-sized city, you could find a D&amp;D manual and buy it. And you probably did, because it sure seemed like everyone you played with had one.<br/><br/>Running out of copies to sell might be a problem for small press/indie games (the kind of problem most wouldn't mind having, I'd wager), but for the 800-pound gorilla of the RPG scene? Doubtful. Very, very doubtful. It definitely wouldn't take them twenty years (or two years, or a year) to print enough copies to saturate the market, because saturating the market is basically <i>their thing</i>.<br/><br/><br/>It's seemed pretty obvious for a while now that the main advantage of releasing a new edition for D&amp;D is the upsell. If a million people bought X edition, then two years from now you can sell those same people X+1 edition, and now you've sold them two primary rulebooks instead of one. As a bonus, if they bought six supplements for X edition, now they've got incentive to buy six updated supplements for X+1 edition. If it brings lapsed D&amp;D players back to the fold (even if it's just to look at it), so much the better, but the fact is, it really doesn't matter if the previous edition was "successful" when their market penetration is that high. They'd do a new edition anyway, because they're not a scrappy underdog company with oodles of potential customers who haven't heard of their game: the best way for them to keep their yearly sales numbers high is to produce new product for their existing customers to buy, and it doesn't seem to take that long before a new edition is guaranteed to sell better than a supplement for the old edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434735/#Comment_434735" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T15:46:51+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  3:46PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is that this industry is so different from others that usual business models don't work on it.

Hasbro is like a rock producer who wants to find the next Beatles and doesn't understand that <i>there will never be another Beatles</i>, not because there's no one out there equally talented, but simply because of the Internet and fragmentation and diversity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434746/#Comment_434746" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T20:54:46+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  8:54PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game companies put out new editions when they feel that they can make money on the new edition, and that they can make more money on it that by continuing to print the old edition.

Somehow it feels like all you need is choose a specialty, a background, wrote down all the things you're given on level 1 and you just got a character with a full story ready to start, all in less than 20 minutes, noob-proof.<br/><br/>And they fixed the Monk with ONE sentence: <i>Your unarmed strike functions as a <b>finesse weapon</b> with which you have proficiency.</i><br/>Now I can picture how in every monk temple, disciples pray saying "my fist is a finesse weapon" like a mantra.<br/><br/>Still, does anybody recognize which version of the playtest is this?

Either is a valid approach depending on the objectives of the game - but I can't think of a circumstance where <i>both</i> is.<br/><br/>* The underwhelming fighter. Someone on Something Awful's done the maths and found that the wizard's ranged at will damage is often <i>better</i> than the fighter's melee at will damage (EDIT: This isn't true - he was forgetting the fighter's Strength modifier!). That's the icing on the cake of a very underwhelming fighter, both in combat and out of it. From 4E, they kept: spellcaster at wills, spellcaster rituals, higher wizard HP.<br/><br/>* A general lack of 4E's presence. I felt 4E identified a lot of problems correctly, even if its solutions were often off the mark. 5E doesn't seem to accept that those are problems, let alone attempt to fix them.<br/><br/>* Save disparity. Someone over at Something Awful ran the numbers on the monsters and spells from the Starter Kit and CON, DEX and WIS are over represented by an order of magnitude compared with STR, INT and CHA. Why separate them if the old FORT, REF and WILL are still going to dominate people's thinking?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by the stuff on gender and sex, the backgrounds (though I'm skeptical of Inspiration Points.

While there was some outcry surrounding 2nd, it wasn't anywhere near as strong (in my personal experience at least). Partially from lack of common internet, sure, but also because 2nd was revision/evolution, while 3rd and 4th were more revolutions (not necessarily in a bad way, just talking severity of changes). Not quite sure where 5th is going to fall along that.<br/><br/>One thing companies (not just roleplayers, talking nearly all companies) seem to have trouble grasping is that when people find a product they mostly like, they don't want big changes to it. Expansions, small fixes, etc. That's it.<br/><br/>They generally have no problem with NEW products that serve a different purpose/niche. They just want it alongside their already existing happy products. <br/><br/>I realize this isn't always conducive to the bottom line, but it IS what people want. When they don't get it, they get surly (and rightly so).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434840/#Comment_434840" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T13:29:04+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  1:29PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How did they do that, by the way?</blockquote>I saw "Time Stop" that stacks up against a +6 "proficiency bonus" and I kind of blanked out.

I mean, your comparisons to past cycles of D&amp;D seems to be concluding that there's nothing new under the sun, and I do agree to a certain extent; however, it is also the case that these repeating features of the public discourse might be meaningful despite the repeating features.<br/><br/>For example, maybe we aren't seeing the <i>same</i> people repeating slogans like idiot parrots, but rather what we see is a serial disappointment, as ever new members of the hobby scene decide that enough is enough and abandon D&amp;D (or abandon the consumerist line, anyway)? I don't know if this is the case, of course, but if it is, that would mean that D&amp;D is managing to shed fans in waves every time they make a move. That's either a really poor track record, or a sign that you really can't make people happy by making changes <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Furthermore, often in these Internet discourses people who have no horse in the race air their viewpoints. This makes it completely understandable that we hear the same complaints about commercialism or whatever for every new edition that comes out: to us as observers it might seem like idiot fans are complaining about the Earth being round, when what we're actually seeing is just some random outsiders muse about their own D&amp;D relationship. It might seem like a stultified relationship stuck on repeating the same complaints we saw 20 years ago, but that just makes sense when it is the same person complaining about the same thing that hasn't changed in the meantime. It's wrong to even call it complaining, it's more like "observing once again".<br/><br/>Of course I do not want to deny your point, either: it is true that hobbyists, like all people, are prone to lacking historical perspective. No doubt many of the people who are now voicing first impressions about the new edition will forget their complaints soon enough, and perhaps they'll even find their own viewpoints absurd in a couple of years, once they get used to the new game. In this regard it's far from a bad idea to draw lessons from history, if only to realize that maybe D&amp;D is not a game for you at all. It does sometimes seem like people would benefit from not taking D&amp;D so seriously.<br/><br/>Myself, for example - I don't have an opinion on the 5th edition, and have yet to actually read any game texts for it. I'll probably take a look when inevitably many friends of mine buy rulebooks for it, but it is likely to remain as irrelevant to me as the prior editions have all been; a highly consumption-oriented game product like that simply isn't relevant to my own real hobby life. For me the real edition change is when we switch campaigns and therefore rework everything about the game from the ground up, not when WotC decides to push a new variation of the game. In this way, while I do play some D&amp;D on occasion, I'm basically just an outside observer to the D&amp;D Olympiad hullabaloo every four years.<br/><br/>I do admit that it makes for a curious sight when people <i>care</i> ever so much about something that can hardly amount to anything except yet another house gloss of D&amp;D. The Internet's full of those, and the deepest practitioners invariably create their own. Not that new variations on the theme aren't interesting and useful to research if you play the game, but it's not like, you know, a sane person would expect a WotC-published variant to be that much better than some blogger's collected notes. The minor edge WotC has for affording a whole team of designers and a comprehensive playtest program (not as much of an advantage as D&amp;D fans generally take it to be - the game's performance ceiling hasn't for a long time been related to issues that can be fixed by playtest) is handily off-set by rogue gamers being able to hone their personal vision in a consistent and non-commercial way.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434846/#Comment_434846" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T15:49:58+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  3:49PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How did they do that, by the way?</blockquote>\nAre you asking how they kept the increase in bonuses low between levels 1 and 20?

I imagine that this networking effect is indeed very important to people who are used to joining existing groups, playing at game stores and otherwise being a member of the "herd". Contrariwise, for hobbyists who are used to making their own groups this might be a total non-issue. I know it is for me, and I remember reading others in the Internet expressing opinions to the tune of complete disregard of what the traditional rpg "industry" is doing. So I would expect the sentiment in this regard to be sharply divided.<br/><br/>Still, interpreting the concerns about D&amp;D as culture warfare explains a lot about how people can care about it so much. The evil empire is stealing their co-players away (or stopping the procurement of new ones), I can see how that might cause feelings of helplessness and frustration, particularly when the fact remains that the gamer is at the teat-sucking end of his cultural relationship to WotC, or whoever might own the D&amp;D brand at a given time: your ability to continue having a hobby and friends is wholly dependent on the commercial choices made by this far-away corporate entity.

One of my Mouse Guard groups is all 35-55. It's reinforced by the understanding that when there weren't all the options we have now there were a LOT of unhappy, unrepresented players. It wasn't that D&amp;D or other old school games were necessarily 'bad', it's that some people were looking for a type of game that hadn't been invented yet. Now that there are such games available those people have something to be happy playing. Conversely it's not that those newer games are 'good' or 'better', just better for that type of player.<br/><br/>In the end it would work out great if we could get everyone (players, designers, &amp; companies) to realize that its this simple preference that underlies the issues, and work towards getting each group a set of actively developed games they want to play instead of telling some people to stick with their old dead games, and another group that all future development will be for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434902/#Comment_434902" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-06T02:46:45+00:00" title="July  6, 2014  2:46AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Thanks!

If ten level one monsters have one tenth the HP of a level ten monster but their attack bonuses are within a few points of the level ten monster's, that makes them a much more realistic threat.<br/><br/>I think HP increasing each level is also considered more of a sacred cow than attack bonuses. From what I can tell, 5E's also gone back to the 2E/3E idea that a monster should get X hit points per hit die, without hit dice = Challenge Rating. (So the 5E ettin's HP are a function of its 9 hit dice, not its Challenge Rating of 2.

The more I read and understand of this edition, the more I go in love with it. On one side you have the evolution of the specialties, now called Martial Archetypes, Domains and Schools of magic. All these are the names of packs of feats, class-oriented for giving one type of specialization to your character, further defining his combat style and forming even more of a background. On the other, it seems there are general feats that are the ones you can get instead of ability bonuses, if I'm not mistaken.<br/><br/>And so far, none of these add bonuses that could ruin the math. All you got is the proficience bonus, that goes up to 6, and a +5 if you max any ability. Magical bonuses from the "magic weapon" spell pile up to +3 when you spend a 9th level slot to cast it (check the magic system, it's still Vancian but the mechanics have definitely evolved to make the old spells even more powerful) I still have to check how other buff spells work and if they pile, but so far this means the higher bonus you can get is a 14. I think I readed somewhere that magic item bonuses could pile up to +4, so make it a +15 at level 20, which still leaves you with plenty chances to miss. Unless you get Advantage somehow. Looks like things can still get epic without being boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435170/#Comment_435170" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-12T05:31:06+00:00" title="July 12, 2014  5:31AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is D&amp;D Next?<br/><br/>Some of us remember that the statement "System Matters" was once controversial.  Now to most of us that's obvious nonsense.  But it was a genuinely held position and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/system_does_matter.html" rel="nofollow">Ron Edwards wrote an entire article to refute it - and with good reason</a>.  D&amp;D Next is D&amp;D re-written by people who think that the main purpose of the rules is to look like something and then get out of the way and let the table get on with things. It also doesn't look like 3.5, it looks a lot like the half-remembered edition <i>3.0</i>.  Because it seems to have been made by taking AD&amp;D and then working out what the best way to progress from there would be.  A lot of the 3.0 choices were very sensible (a lot weren't, but most of those were because people didn't look deep enough or only playtested the first few levels).  So Next has gone back to that drawing board, raided a lot of its sensible choices, and discarded a lot of the fiddly ones.<br/><br/>As for the "failure" of 4E, it is still (as of June 2014 - six months after the end of any content at all) making at least $480,000/month from D&amp;D Insider alone.  Other than Paizo no RPG company makes that sort of money, and the claim it wasn't profitable (other than the systemless Menzobarranzan which sold copies in the three figures) is ridiculous.  Unfortunately <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?315800-4-Hours-w-RSD-Escapist-Bonus-Column/page21&amp;p=5765766#post5765766" rel="nofollow">the core brand target for Hasbro, and hence the target 4E was trying for was $50 million a year</a> - and D&amp;D hasn't made that money since 1983 (and would have required roughly doubling 3.0 or 3.5 sales figures in the year after the PHB came out, and maintaining that rate).  4E's financial target was to be bigger than the entire RPG industry had been prior to 4E, and by that standard it failed.<br/><br/>On a tangent, 3.0 is the great un-edition of D&amp;D - it was replaced after a mere two and a half years by something more incompatible (and deliberately so) than 1E was with 2E.  And if you look at messageboards, 3.5 is used in specific much of the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435179/#Comment_435179" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-12T17:54:25+00:00" title="July 12, 2014  5:54PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of the 'system matters' debate was mistaken attribution. Most of the people that argued system didn't matter meant only that there is no best system...different systems were equally good for different reasons, and in that they're totally correct. Many others meant only that systems aren't wholly immutable. 'Rule 0' or modding can create what someone wants from something they otherwise wouldn't touch, thereby making the system 'as is' less central. This is also true, though it does require what many deem an unnecessary investment of time and effort. <br/><br/>I would also point out that I never said 4th wasn't making money, only that it wasn't meeting goals (which as you say were ridiculous on their face). I personally think that 4th was doing more than well enough, and should still be actively produced - and I say that as someone who doesn't even like 4th. However, it failed to meet both profit goals and the breadth of popularity desired. In that I don't think there can be much debate. We can debate rather the goals were reasonable, but not that it failed to meet them, leading directly to the development of 5th.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robertsconley" title="robertsconley"><img alt="robertsconley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robertsconley">robertsconley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435218/#Comment_435218" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T06:52:34+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  6:52AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So at some point I tried to run some D&amp;D next \u2026 and I've completely lost track of what it's trying to be. A close friend on this forum (veritascitor) has been trying to tell me but I just can't understand, and I think he knows that I can't understand because I have thought about D&amp;D in general too much and too little and now I'm completely confused. But some other friends potentially want me to run it at a con so I really really want to know \u2026 what is it?<br/> </blockquote>\nThe short answer is that D&amp;D Next (or 5e now that it is released) is about nothing and everything. <br/><br/>What the game gives are the tools to make it easy for you to referee your players while they adventure in a fantasy setting using the tropes of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Orcs, gold, wizards, dragons, dungeons, wilderness, etc, etc). The tropes are fairly flexible enough to run a wide variety of fantasy settings. Although not infinite. <br/><br/>What it is about depends up to what you, as the referee of a campaign, want it to be about. <br/><br/>Some folks think D&amp;D is about dungeon crawling. Dungeon crawling a well supported in Dungeon &amp; Dragon because it been found to be one of the easiest type of adventure to explain to a novice in tabletop roleplaying game. Make a maze, add rooms, populate them with monsters and treasures, and place the characters at the entrance.<br/><br/>But like most tabletop roleplaying games, D&amp;D supports many other types of adventures such as those founding underwater, wilderness, city, other planes of existence, and so on.<br/><br/>With that many think that D&amp;D is made to support heroic adventuring. There are indeed a lot of suggestions, tables, and advice for making heroic adventures in D&amp;D. But the fundmental mechanic of D&amp;D, the one that sets is part from its progenitors, is this; The referee adjudicate the actions of the players acting as their characters. <br/><br/>This single rule is the only rule that is necessary for tabletop roleplaying. The rest are guidelines and aides meant to make the game more fair, manageable, and/or fun. There is no preconceived notion as to what actions the players may attempt. This doesn't not everything will be possible. The players are acting as characters with finite abilities and limits. <br/><br/>This means if a session revolving around intrigue at a Duke's Ball it can be run using D&amp;D, GURPS, Fate, or any number of tabletop roleplaying games as all of them share this mechanics. <br/><br/>What differs between different RPGs are the tools in which you use to adjudicate what the players are trying to do. Fate has one set of mechanics, D&amp;D 5e has another. Some games don't have much in the way of social interaction rules. For example OD&amp;D (the original 1974 rules) only had the charisma stat as a rough guide. <br/><br/>Does this mean that you can't run the Duke's Ball in OD&amp;D? Of course not. But does put a bigger burden on the referee's judgment to come up with rulings for things like when Marvalo the Magnificent tries to talk his way out when he was discovered in a compromising position with the Duke's daughter.<br/><br/>With all this being said, the key elements in your decision in running a session of D&amp;D 5e are<br/><br/>1) Do you have any fun and interesting adventures/situations that incorporate some of the fantasy tropes of D&amp;D 5e?<br/><br/>2) Will the rules of D&amp;D 5e help you in adjudicating what your friends do when dealing with the situation you designed?<br/><br/>If either one is no, then probably running a game of D&amp;D 5e won't be fun for you. If they are both yes, then likely you can run a fun session of D&amp;D 5e even though you prefer other games.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435224/#Comment_435224" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T12:09:17+00:00" title="July 14, 2014 12:09PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, <a href="/forums/profile/robertsconley">@robertsconley</a> .

A relatively straightforward and short set of core rules and terminology. The specifics of the classes and creatures were designed to be exceptions to this core rules with the particulars spelled out. <br/><br/>This design was used to great effect in Magic the Gathering. But what Magic the Gathering did was refresh itself with every release of new sets and new editions of the core set. How Magic the Gathering plays in 2014 is not the same game as it played in 2007 or in 2000 or when it was first released in the 1990s. That was not achieved by altering the rules but rather the exceptions. The exact mix of which was varied to keep MtG an interesting game.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4e did not do this. Instead it remained a High powered High Fantasy game to this day. Wizards could have come out different sourcebooks that targeted different styles of fantasy (gritty, swords &amp; sorcery, etc). But they didn't. This and  an a poor third party license doom 4e to be a one note wonder. A system that people got bored with quicker than previous editions. <br/><br/>Now D&amp;D 5e Basic has only four classes and four races and a handful of other options? While it seems as limiting at 4e in its own way, the difference that to add or change things is considerably easier with 5e. It is a lighter system than 4e (or even 3e in that regard) a characteristic that it shares with Fate. It is easier to add complexity and detail and it is to subtract.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435233/#Comment_435233" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T13:07:16+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  1:07PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, I'm already using it to hack Anima Beyond Fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435252/#Comment_435252" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T15:46:09+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  3:46PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>While I agree that 4e mechanics was a definitive break from prior editions, I think the achilles heels that it was a one note game. <br/><br/>D&amp;D 4e did not do this.

The theme of 5E is unity. 4E's problem wasn't truly about its lack of commercial success or whatever. It's that it was *divisive*. It didn't *feel* like D&amp;D to many people\u2014even people who liked it! And on that level, I think 5E is going to be a resounding success. There's very little in the game that is going to offend or trouble any particular aesthetic group of gamers. And it's pretty easily hackable with minor tweaks.</blockquote>\nExcept I'm not sure very many D&amp;D players see it that way.  To many 4E players, it's a statement that the game they like is a failure, and reads like a slap in the face to WotC's most loyal customer base.  And to many players of earlier editions and their clones, it's a half-assed attempt that only pays lip service to the things they like about the game they play.<br/><br/>I think the only people that end up gravitating to this in particularly large numbers are people that care more about the ideal of dungeons and dragons than the actual game, and I'm not sure there are enough of them to make it anything but a dud.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435290/#Comment_435290" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T01:55:56+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  1:55AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only problem with 3rd party classes, feats, monsters, items and so on, in 4E, was that WotC had not prepared any way for that content to be integrated in the online tools (charbuilder and DM tools). A much more wiser plan would have been to have them as in-app-purchases (so to speak), and/or the option for a publisher to make the content available in the online tools after you bought the pdfs (with a custom coupon/key, for example).<br/><br/>I played a very successful campaign in 4E and, especially given that I am completely averse to big systems full of options (as a general rule) I personally would not have played 4E at all without the digital tools. <br/><br/>I know hindsight is 20/20, and a move like that (in-app-purchases) back then would probably have branded WotC even more as trying to milk money from the players... but still, I think it could have kept the 3rd party market interesting. And maybe even foster some 3rd party setting with a different flavor than superpowered heroes dungeonpunk, possibly.<br/><br/>Sidenote: 4E is the only edition of DnD I ever had any interest in playing, and unsurprisingly the news of 5E (back from when it was called Next and the first playtest packages were out) left me completely cold.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435291/#Comment_435291" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T01:59:01+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  1:59AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It will be quite interesting to see how this new edition of the game fares in the marketplace! This is how sports fans must feel in the eve of a great sports spectacle. It's unity and sentimental belonging in the crowd, versus post-modern fracturing of the markets combined with general disinterest in what D&amp;D has to offer. Battle of the century! Hopefully we'll start getting some preliminary results regarding the reception around Christmas or so.<br/><br/>It cannot be denied that the mere brand value of D&amp;D gives the new edition massive amounts of attention. I don't think that my friends are even particularly hardcore regarding commercial D&amp;D, but we still end up discussing the in-coming edition regularly simply because it's a big event in our field of interest. Seems to me that many will buy at least some of it because of this simple popularity effect, even as at the same time it seems extremely unlikely that we would end up playing it seriously, considering how most of the alpha GM personalities in our circles are so very out of tune with modern D&amp;D. Truly goes to show how scale and tradition matter, a small press game can only dream of having people care so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dimaension_X" title="Dimaension_X"><img alt="Dimaension_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dimaension_X">Dimaension_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435296/#Comment_435296" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T05:34:54+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  5:34AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny.

Why? I guess it's because I started playing 3.5 and the best moments I had with that edition was when I didn't had to know all the rules to play. The excellent campaign we were having was ruined when the GM decided, quoting him, "to take off the velvet gloves" and started to use (and abuse) the game rules to their fullest.<br/><br/>Then I was suddenly confronted to a game whose complexity I couldn't handle in a quick way, and a situation where I either had to minmax or let the GM humilliate me through my character. The little teamwork our group had end up falling apart as even the best built PCs were using the rest as human shields, cannon fodder or trap disabling devices. Roleplaying was reduced to the GM forcefully railroding us or we managing to breake the setting. Granted, this is just another form of fun, I kept playing for a while anyway and some of my friends still enjoy it. A couple of years ago I understood that if we had stopped resisting the GM attempts to railroad us by undermining his work, we might have enjoyed a really good old school campaign.<br/><br/>But the fact is that after that I couldn't play D&amp;D again without stressing about my character build, while my best moments in the game were when I made a Character, and not a bunch of stats. By then, I had found Anima Beyond Fantasy and I started to hack it away with all the interesting indie stuff I found. I don't think I would have tried to make a heartbreaker, I just hated D&amp;D too much on those days.<br/><br/>Later, a friend of mine convinced me into playing Pathfinder, and while I did felt it a bit more balanced than 3.5, some of the same problems were still there, and it was still stressing me out for making a good built. He went easy on us and we managed to play a good campaign, I even got away at playing a character instead of a bunch of stats. But, come on, discovering that not in the character creation section, but in the skills definitions chapter (those I didn't care to read before because we all know what acrobatics is for) there was a pharagraph that stated that you had a +3 to all your trained skills. This isn't stated anywhere else in the book. It's things like this that put me on guard and make me stress if the book is hiding something else from me, because in my mind that +3 can save my character from way too many frustrating useless deaths.<br/><br/>And why do I care so much about my character dying? Because it's such a chore for me to finely calibrate, find all the hidden +1.5's in the book, that extra AC valid in obscure situations and the proper combination of feats that let me deal with the game, that I loathe to go about it again. 4ed made me felt things had gone worse since all I had learned about the game the hard way had no value anymore, and all the rules called for combat, which for me meant that now I had to read even more pages to save my "bunch of stats" that the GM kept calling "my character"<br/><br/>So, you would understand why 5th feels like things are getting better to me. I went on and tried to make a character, and I got a character. I became worried and tried to make an optimized bunch of stats, and I ended up with a character. Even when I didn't care for it, the little guy came out of the character creation chapter with a story, traits, a personality, a background. I didn't even had to worry about reading all the setting metadrama like in 13th age. Lack of math didn't meant a lack of options even on first level. But of course I'm still suspicious. I still have to play it to see how it goes. But for a long, long time, I can finally feel relieved again that I'm playing a character and not a bunch of stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435302/#Comment_435302" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T08:20:46+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  8:20AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hey, look, it's "System Doesn't Matter."</blockquote>I'm getting more of a vibe like...

Sounds about right to me, too. Great term!<br/><br/>I remember my only time playing in a 3rd Edition game with a non-pregen character. I made what I thought was a pretty interesting character, both character-wise and in terms of an unusual combination of abilities.<br/><br/>First, the other players reamed me out for not optimizing the character enough (even though this was one of those games where "we didn't roll the dice at all last session! Have a bonus for awesome roleplaying, when you cried at the death of the Duke's horse!").<br/><br/>Not too surprising, given that I was barely familiar with the rules, and just threw something together as best I could. But not fun. Really, friends?<br/><br/>But then, two sessions in, the GM informed me that he would have to curtail some of my character's abilities, because they were too powerful (in the social realm - this campaign involved a lot of intrigue and GM-plot based on stuff being mysterious, and my character could pretty much always tell when someone was lying, which made the GM's attempts to stick to his plot impossible).<br/><br/>For what it's worth, the impression I get from 5th Ed (is it officially not "D&amp;D Next" anymore?) is that it should be playable by folks of various stripes, including OSR-style play. That's somewhat interesting, and I like some of the details they've put into the design so far, based on that Google link.<br/><br/>I can't really imagine buying it, but I can imagine playing it much more than I could with 4E.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435335/#Comment_435335" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T15:29:10+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  3:29PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no objection to buying it; I just picked up the starter set, and read through the 32 page rules on the train. <br/><br/>(No character creation or classes and not much GM guidance)<br/><br/>First impression: if someone else had done this I would be like "Meh." Because it doesn't seem that special. But I think that may give this things legs as a common framework for GMs. With DIY being so core to the experience that could have legs, but we have to wait and see. <br/><br/>I have no doubts about saying this is a fully playable version of game recognizable as D&amp;D.  If we don't have too many proud nails, that would be awesome but we won't know until it's given serious play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435338/#Comment_435338" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T15:39:06+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  3:39PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's my first impression, too.

The game is the Basic D&amp;D PDF that they released for free. Right now they are not releasing the whole game. It obvious they have a specific marketing and product release plan. On one hand they don't want to rush the release as they don't want to get socked with errata. On the other hand they want to keep people talking (and playing something) until they get the whole thing out there.<br/><br/>Whether it is a good plan is something we can only see in hindsight. If they avoid the missteps and problems of prior releases and it sells like gangbusters then it was a good plan despite the frustration of many of not having the complete game.<br/><br/>Ultimately what it will look like this in the first year. You have the free Basic D&amp;D PDF which offers four classes, a handful of options (mostly backgrounds), a culled list of monsters, treasures, and other items to sustain a complete campaign. The Starter Set focuses on a initial adventure and a hold you by the hands set of rules and semi-pregen characters. I call them semi-pregen because if you look at them they are pretty much the description of the class in the Basic PDF. The main difference is that the rules on the sheets only go up to 5th level.<br/><br/>Then you have a set of core books (PHB, MM, and DMG) that presents a core set of rules plus a bunch of options to tweak the core rules into something similar to how you like to run D&amp;D. Lots of character options like 3e, lots of tactical options like 4e, lots of roleplaying options like 2e, or just ignore the option to gain the simplicity of the classic editions.<br/><br/>Along with this will be a initial set of adventures. <br/><br/>There also be a organized play rules booklet plus supporting adventures.<br/><br/>That sums up what i know about their initial year of releases.<br/><br/>They do have a plan whether it is a good plan remains to be seen. Certainly it been going better than the the 4e launch where they mocked the prior editions of D&amp;D and alienated half of the fans.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435352/#Comment_435352" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T19:05:39+00:00" title="July 15, 2014  7:05PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I have an idea about D&amp;D Next so I'm going to start a new thread.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19535/i-actually-have-no-idea-about-d-d-next-done/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19535/i-actually-have-no-idea-about-d-d-next-done">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19535/i-actually-have-no-idea-about-d-d-next-done/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19535/i-actually-have-no-idea-about-d-d-next-done/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19535%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19535%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
