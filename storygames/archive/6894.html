Ogre got us all pumped up for Spirit of the Century (which I'm looking forward to).<br/><br/>The other game that was mentioned was King Arthur Pendragon (Chaosium first published 1985), better known simply as Pendragon. One of the group had a pile of the books and really wanted to PLAY not run the game. I said I'd give it a shot. <br/><br/>As soon as I saw the books I realized I had played it before. One "adventure" back in '90 or '91.<br/><br/>I remember I liked the game well enough but I was more excited by the "epic" nature of it. That if we played a full "campaign" at the end we would likely be playing the grandchildren of our first Characters, that adventures were to be separated by at least a year's time... that we would be creating a legend or epic series of stories.<br/><br/>This concept was, to us at least, revolutionary. Which means that everybody else hated it. The really seemed be opposed to the idea of generational Characters. To them Role Playing meant playing ONE character... even though when we played D&amp;D they all played at least two characters at once... hmmm....<br/><br/>ANY WAY... back to the point (or really getting to the point in the first place).<br/><br/>Has anyone played Pendragon?<br/><br/>What are your thoughts?<br/><br/>What are the games strengths/weakness?<br/><br/>Any hints?<br/><br/>Cheers in advance!<br/><br/>-Mr B                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153500/#Comment_153500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T01:17:32+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  1:17AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, I have wasted an entire generation of Saxons on the end of my sword, putting that whelp Arthur on the throne. And it was amazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strengths of the game? IMO the mechanics do one of the best jobs ever in fitting the crunchy bits to the setting. Sure, you have to get some sort of understanding of how Passions etc. work for your group and you might have to fiddle with the massed combat to taste, but boy, it does the job. The generational aspect is fantastic but again it is something that you can dial up or dial down. We played from the start of the Great Pendragon Campaign to the coronation and knighting of Arthur (done by yours truly in one of my proudest roleplaying moments) and we got to the end of one generation of knights. Our sons, as they reached maturity, began to run side missions and have little sessions where they were played out as 'meanwhile, back at Sarum...' characters. Moreover, you have an entire FAMILY to deal with and thats always going to cause complications. In the BEST way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weaknesses of the game? I don't see Pendragon as a game that you get great value from in a one-shot or couple of session format. You have to play it out across a longer campaign to really feel the benefit of the mechanics and the setting. This might not suit some groups. If you use the old rules and a lot of the old supplements you can get bogged down in a lot of manorial book-keeping which might not suit everyone. And you are playing the KING ARTHUR ROLEPLAYING GAME. I emphasise that because the game plays out the history of Arthur with you as major players, but you are Knights and you are expected to do Knightly things. Some people complain that this is a straitjacket to play value and creativity. I say, what part of the games title made you think it would be anything else?<br/>\n<br/>\nPendragon is not a hippy indie game. At its core its a 20-odd year old game dragged kicking and screaming out of Runequest and told to grow up! It is however, utterly brilliant at what it does and in many aspects, again IMO, ahead of its time. If you want to import in some 'indie techniques' to customise Sarum a little, do some scene framing and make the battles a little more cinematic it can reach a real purring level of sweetness. Or at least it did for my group.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil<br/>\n<br/>\n(Or Lord Brion O'Hara of Donnington, High Warlord of Salisbury and Master of Horse and Hounds to King Uther, Vanquisher of the Bear Clan and known to the Saxons as 'Sir Brion the Bastard')                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153509/#Comment_153509" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T03:35:57+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  3:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran for the Great Pendragon Campaign for the best part of the year.

The Passions and Traits are quite nice, but they can be a complete pain when a bad role sends a character mad at the wrong moment. It is frequently arbitary and characters die suddenly and randomly. This is good in some ways, but a few sudden deaths can really mess up the generational game that forms the real strength of the play-style.<br><br>Don't buy the GPC. Frankly, it's so badly put together that while the 80 year grand campaign itself is a cracking idea, the book itself is actively unhelpful in helping you do that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153532/#Comment_153532" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T08:06:12+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  8:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.meekmok.com/games/rpg/pen/" rel="nofollow">We played a long Pendragon campaign</a> and enjoyed it, despite the rules set.

I see the game (and I've talked about this with Stafford and he concurred) that the game is more like walking The Stations of the Cross in the Catholic Church, if you will.  Or, to get less denominational, like the stages of a Hero Quest in <i>HeroQuest</i>.  The game asks the Players to sink into this story and experience it as participants who don't get to change the big story.<br/><br/>Now, contemporary audiences are used to T.H. White's <i>The Once and Future King</i> and the musical <i>Camelot</i> (based on White's book), and other recent novels that deal with the "primary players."  But Thomas Mallory and the French romances are really inspiration for Stafford's game.<br/><br/>If you've had a chance to read Thomas Mallory's <i>Le Morte D'arthur</i>, you'll notice, strangely, that there's a lot of Arthur and Guinevere and Lancelot, but there's a lot more about a lot of other characters.  The book is really a collection of stories about lots of knights, of how they stand in relation to each other and how they stand in relation to Arthur.  <br/><br/>Seen this way, you and your players are adding tales to that tradition (which I think is an utterly cool and wonderful thing), tales taking place in the <i>foreground</i> of Arthur's rise and fall.  Arthur's rise and fall and the love triangle take place in the <i>background</i> of the Player Knight's lives.  That's a huge shift in perspective as people usually think of it, but it's very important: <i>Arthur isn't where the action is</i>.  Where the Player Knights are is where the action is.<br/><br/>This is all part and parcel of the Traits and Passions mechanics, as well as the bits about disease and aging and death.  As Stafford wrote in an earlier edition of the game: <i><b>"The game tries less to adapt the milieu to the modem mind than to instruct the modern mind to the milieu."</b></i>  To this end, the Players are placed within a world where they are not the movers and shakers, where magic is outside of the control and understanding, where Passions and Traits and Disease and Death <i>impress</i> themselves upon the Player Knights -- and the <i>Players</i> -- in ways that would be unthinkable in other RPGs.  The Players are both participant and witness, storyteller and shaman telling the tale.  (Okay, flowery, but I think I'm being pretty true to Stafford here!)  <br/><br/>Another important -- really important -- point.  The Great Campaign is NOT a metaplot as we know it from game lines past.  The differences are vital:\n<ul>\n<li>In a "metaplot" from most game lines the Players (and even the GM!) had NO idea where the story is going.  In Pendragon everyone knows where the story is going.  This gives the Players a chance to have their character knights stand in ironic relation to the larger back story of Camelot and Arthur's rise and fall.  This is a HUGE difference.  It gives the Players immense creative possibilities to create amazing moments where the choices they make for their knights are fully informed by the story that everyone at the table knows, though their characters do not.<br/><br/></li><li>Because everyone knows the backstory, there is either complete buy in or there isn't on the part of the Players.  You never reach that moment when Great Uza (or whomever) dies when supplement <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2314&amp;Mode=like">#14</a> comes out, and one or more Players go, "What? That blows!  Great Uza is why I was <i>playing</i> this game.")  With the Great King Arthur Campaign, what matters is how the Players choose to plug themselves in events that the know are coming.  Will they side with Lancelot or Arthur when the split comes?  Well, that's something to anticipate and plan toward -- not be surprised by later on.<br/><br/></li><li>There are no railroad tracks.  Unlike most metaplot games, where the GM has to keep tearing up and laying down new tracks to make sure the Players don't get to far afield of what's <i>really</i> going on, what's really going on in Pendragon is the lives of the Player Knights.  It's like setting a story against the back drop of World War II and having the Player Characters be the GIs working their way across Europe.  Sure, someone might say, "Hey, If your not playing Churchill, Stalin and Hitler, what the hell's the point?"  But most folks can see how playing those GI will be full of drama even if the GM sticks the events of history and the PCs make choices and live out their lives within that drama.  But this works in The Great Campaign (maybe counter-intuitively) because all the facts and history are known.  In most of the metaplot games, the uber-NPCs really could move and shake everything the PCs had been doing into useless shambles because who the hell knew what the game company was going to publish next month.  And the metaplot really was about the Churchill's and Hitlers of the game world.  In Pendragon all the stuff of the Arthur and Camelot and the love triangle is a given.  Okay, then -- that's that that's a given, what is left to explore and discover?  The lives of the Player Knights!</li>\n</ul>\nSo, I wouldn't want the Players to replace the famous knights -- though it's certainly possible they'll be sitting alongside them at the Round Table.  The story that matters, however, is the story of the Player Knights, a new cycle of tales of men and women caught between the tension of inspiring ideals and grounded realities; the stories of how they conducted themselves as citizens, warriors, lovers, fathers and servants of a king in a land of god, war, fairies, and family.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153575/#Comment_153575" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T12:38:44+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 12:38PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>This is all part and parcel of the Traits and Passions mechanics</blockquote>\nhi Christopher,<br/><br/>how do the Traits and Passions mechanics interact with what the game is about?

They feel strongly about God.  They feel strongly about the women they love.  They feel strongly about their lord, their king, their families.  They feel strongly about Saxons and bastards who killed their father and whomever else they hate.<br/><br/>The feel strongly.  And from these strong feelings come strong <i>ACTIONS</i>.  And those actions in the tales are often things we would consider wrong, wrong, wrong.  (You'll note that there is no "Intelligence" Stat in <i>Pendragon</i>, nor anything like it.  This is important!)<br/><br/>The Traits mechanics reflect that the Knights of Mallory are characters of behavior.  They do not live by the psychological insights that we assume all characters live by in fiction (or we live by in life).  They are their Traits: the behaviors the Knights are known for.  "Known for" in <i>Pendragon</i> means a score of 16 or more.  This nets the Player Knight Glory every year equal to the value of the score.  It also means that when the Knight is tested in anyway along these behaviors he will usually react that way. (But not necessarily! GMs botch this rule all the time!)  If the Player Knight has a Lazy of 17, he'll most like be lazy -- even if his lord asked him to stay up and keep watch that night on the castle tower.  If a Player Knight is Honest 18 he'll most likely tell the truth -- even if it would be to his advantage to lie, even if it means putting someone he loves in danger.<br/><br/>Note that both "good" and "bad" behaviors gain Glory at scores above 16.  What matters is to have a Trait of behavior so strong, the Player Knight is <i>known</i> for it.  To be known is the goal of the game.  The game's reward system is GLORY, not experience, and Glory is the sum total of actions, behaviors, adventures, extravagant expenses, holdings of land and so on... all the things that make a Knight a presence in the world.  You get Glory for being knighted as a squire, you get Glory for getting married, you get Glory for being given a holding, you get Glory for being present at the pulling of the Sword from the Stone -- you were there! -- and that gets you Glory.<br/><br/>But the Glory you get comes at the price of being extreme in behavior.  We know people who are extreme in behavior, and better or worse, we remember them.  These are the kinds of characters Greg Stafford modeled in his rules for the game.  Significantly, it means that sometimes the Players are along for the ride with the Player Knights.  The enemy of the Player Knight's family walks into Arthur's Court, and the GM asks for a Vengeful or Reckless Roll (if the Player Knight's Traits are high enough to demand a roll), and the Player Knight might very well end up walking right up that family enemy and lobbing the man's head off -- right in Arthur's court!  That's a terrible breach of conduct, as Arthur (like any lord) promises safety to anyone in his court.  <br/><br/>So now the Player has a Player Knight who has done this thing!  Now what?  Arthur might banish the knight.  (This happened to several knights in Le Morte D'Arthur for exactly this kind of behavior!)  Or the Player Knight might flee!  Or the decapitated man's family might start a blood feud that rages and distracts the kingdom from the threat of the Saxons!  Or the Player might have the knight drop to his knees before Arthur and say, "Assign me any punishment for what I have done!" or "Assign me any task to make up for what I have done!"  Or the Player might have his Player Knight deliver himself to the hands of his enemies to avoid a blood feud and spare his family.  Who knows?  The point is that the Player sometimes rides the behavior of the knight like someone riding a wild horse and sees where he ends up.  And from there a new set of story elements and problems are derived and we see where we go next. <br/><br/>That's what I mean that Pendragon demands that the Player is both witness and participant to the ritual telling of the tales of these Arthurian knights they've created, both audience and story-telling shaman to the tale.  The games' world and events impress themselves into the Player's experience directly -- even the Players' <i>character</i>, which is usually sacrosanct and off limits in most games.  <br/><br/>Of course, if the Player makes choices that go against his Famous Traits, the value of that Trait will start to drop.<br/><br/><br/>There is another significant aspect to the Traits that is seldom touched on in the rules, but very, very important.  By getting high values in a specific collection of traits one can get bonuses for the Player Knight.  A specific collection of Traits will get a Player Knight a Chivalry bonus; another collection will get the Knight a Christian Religion Bonus; another will get a Pagan Religion Bonus.  Not only do knights who live by these Chivalrous Virtues or Religious Virtues gain an annual Glory bonus, but they get mechanical rewards as well: Chivalric Knights get a constant +3 Armor for example; knights living in accordance with Pagan virtues get a healing rate bonus.<br/><br/>But, significantly, it is hard to be both a Chivalric Knight and a Religious Knight.  There are too many Traits to increase keep at a high value; it's hard to have so many Traits demanding action all the time.  It can be done!  But it's hard!  And this is one of the games many tension points between duty to laws of the land and laws of god or gods. (You will find this same tension throughout Glorantha (Stafford's amazing RPG setting) and in the rules of HeroQuest.)<br/><br/>This, to me, is an amazing payoff for the Traits rules.  You can go for a bonus, but which one?  And how will that choice intersect with your Knight in daily and dramatic decisions as he strives to live by ideals when ideals sometimes get in the way of survival, loyalty, love and other ideals?<br/><br/>[continued]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153584/#Comment_153584" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T13:55:10+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  1:55PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2008 2:19PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued]<br/><br/>The Passions are an extension of the idea of big feelings, big actions.  These are characters who MUST take action.  When the chips are down (or when a player really wants to spike an action) he or she can invoke Passions for the Player Knight.  Loyalty to Lord, Hatred of Saxons, Love of Wife -- the whole range of Passions and passions directed at certain groups or specific people are possible.  Not only do the Passion rules offer a specific mechanical benefit to Player Knight personalities, but I've found they really energize the Players when invoked.  Invoking Passions really puts on the line "I really hate theses Saxons! I become almost superhuman when fighting them!" or "My love for my wife will make me ride all day and all knight for five days to return home and save her!"  The rolls mark extremes -- and again, superhuman -- moments of behavior and action that lift the knights out of the mundane and into that realm that approaches Lancelot and Gawain in their deeds, making them worthy characters in a fresh cycle of tales for Arthurian Knights.<br/><br/>There are game mechanic limiters on Passions, just as there are for Traits.  The GM and Players can make calls for Passions, making moments that say, "This matters!" and go for that mechanical advantage. If a Player Knight is very Passionate about something, and that object is at risk or a threat -- or even present! -- it means that the Player Knight might take strong action even if it's not a very good idea.<br/><br/>Positive results mean anything from a +10 skill point bonus to the duration of the event at hand, to a <i>doubling</i> of the Player Knight's skill for the duration of the event.  Negative results on a Passion roll will mean a loss of a point for the Passion's value and suffers a loss of skill value for the duration f the event and might even become maddened and flee.  (The narrative context of the madness to be decided by the Players and GM: did he realize when tested his courage to protect his wife failed him? That despite his father's teachings he couldn't slay the son of their father's family? And so on...)<br/><br/><br/>This is all story stuff, these Traits and Passions, marking the Characters as creatures of their feelings and behaviors, not strategic choices and tactics.  To fully mark these moments with description and narrative the Players must find within themselves the feelings and actions dictated by the roll of the dice. It is an invitation to feel and go toward places they often never expected to go!  <br/><br/>This is the activity of the actor or the ritual participant acting out a part that is not them, but that moves them in new and cool ways, opening their experience in a subtle way.  It's reading a book, identifying with a character that is not you and not behaving by the choices you would make, but getting caught up in feelings or choices we often avoid in daily life (for good reason!) but experiencing them safely in the environment of play.  <br/><br/>It's Stafford's view that by meeting up with these larger than life characters and behaviors we take away something very important from the myths we are interacting with. Certainly, in my experience, it's provided a hell of a lot of fun!<br/><br/><br/>How's that?<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153585/#Comment_153585" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T13:56:31+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  1:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd!

However, neither I, nor most of the other people I play with, can muster all that much interest in High Romance Chivalric Knighthood. Because the mechanics are so closely infused in the setting, is it a hopeless project to play <i>Pendragon</i>, but askew?<br/><br/>The feel I'd really like to achieve is a cross between the whimsy of Vance's "Lyonesse" and the movies of Miyazaki, especially "Mononoke-hime" and "Nausicaa".<br/><br/>Is it possible to play <i>Pendragon</i> as if it were an anime, while still using the rules as written? From a thematic point of view, I don't see a tremendous amount of conflict (in theory); it seems to me that what we'd be talking about is a slightly askew shift in tone and not a completely different ballpark. (One of the things I rather like about <i>HeroQuest</i> is the mantra of "your Glorantha will vary"; although those rules have certain pinned-to-the-setting implications as well, especially in the magic rules, they're actually wonderfully flexible. I'm not sure that <i>Pendragon</i> is as flexible in that regard.)<br/><br/>Can anyone comment usefully on how well the game can be used to play a "non-standard Arthur"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
