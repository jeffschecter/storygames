I prepped just a little bit by looking at a few Oracles and putting down a few characters and connections; just situation, not plot.   I don't think that was the issue - the characters were interesting and they had a stake in the situation. <br/><br/>My problem was mainly that we would push towards conflict; get to 'conflict state', the players roll once, and its conflict over; move on. It ended up being quite anticlimactic - a player goes to fight a guy, rolls once, whole fight is over. Since there's not explicit 'stake setting', I avoided that at first, but my DiTV habits kicked in and I started asking for or suggesting stakes for conflicts. Still, they happen fast; and it wasn't long before one of the players was at 0 pool.  As I understand it, the thing for him to do is to win lots of little conflicts and build his pool back up, so he started coming up with small little challenges - "can I get this dude at the bar to tell me what he knows?" or "Can I steal an apple without the shopkeeper noticing?" - but we all knew they would avoid bigger conflicts until he had a reasonable sized pool to work with; and I didn't want to abuse GM power by pressing big conflicts he wasn't ready to handle; so instead we ended up just gifting him back some pool so the plot could move on.<br/><br/>So, clearly, I'm not doing this right. Pool folks, what do you suggest?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165830/#Comment_165830" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T17:41:18+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  5:41PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's okay to give big conflicts to a guy with a low pool - if he has accumulated any dice at all, he will use them if he cares, and if even 4-5 dice give a pretty good chance of success. So you don't have to hold back, too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn to the other question, a bit of background that you're probably aware of first.<br/>\nIn the Pool, the GM describes the situation, the players tell the GM what their characters try to do, and the GM describes (a) what happens - how and whether the players succeed, and (b) how the world and NPCs respond. Then the GM continues narration, and the players offer their contributions at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice how in the above procedure, it's the GM describing everything? In practice, the GM will often let players describe what their characters do, but he doesn't have to - at all times, he has authority over what happens in the fiction, unless the players roll dice.<br/>\nSo, you really go to dice in two situations:<br/>\na) The GM describes something happening that causes a player to say, "No Way!", and the <i>player</i> declares he is rolling his dice.<br/>\nb) The GM has been allowing players to describe their actions and successes, and one of them says something that makes him think, "It would be fun if that didn't work out quite the way he described," and so he says, "Not so fast! You'll need to roll dice for that."<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice in neither case, there is no explicit stake setting. Something happens causing someone to say, "not so fast," the dice roll, and them either the player or the GM get to describe what happens afterwards - and the thing that the dice are rolled for might actually end up being a very small part of the ensuing narration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when a player wins narration, it's the GM that decides what is the allowed scope of that narration. It's perfectly okay for the GM to set limits on what a player can achieve with a single roll. One of my games, a Castle Falkenstein game, had the players being chased by a tank the size of a battleship, and over the course of at least half a dozen rolls each, they managed to board it (one roll), fight their way through a compartment, killing stormtroopers as they went (another roll), try to enter the bridge but were driven back onto the roof (a fail), one of them was thrown off onto a nearby support craft and had the opportunity to hold off reinforcements boarding the tank (a fail, followed by another roll or two), while the other threw his opponent of the roof and entered the engine room and set it to blow (a success), then failed to escape without injury (a fail).<br/>\nIt was a very memorable fight, precisely because multiple rolls of the dice led to a few twists and turns.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, the key to successful pool play has been to watch for fun moments to roll the dice, and when the players win, give them control of the narration for a few minutes - or maybe less.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also used Anti-Pool variant, where if you succeed, you lose the dice gambled, and if you fail, you get one back. I wasn't using it during the above fight, though. I've even used both Pool and Anti-pool in the same game: "This scene is a high stakes one, so any dice rolling will use the Anti-Pool rules."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165842/#Comment_165842" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T19:07:16+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  7:07PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Pool requires a very pro-active GM.  Your GMing should be totally blind to the state of the player's dice pools.  GM from the gut.  When the conflict arises don't set stakes.  The intentions behind the actions of the players should be clear but full stakes is unnecessary and in fact causes problems.  Success means the players intentions are realized but they now have a choice, take a die or guarantee that everything goes down the way they want it to.  When they take a die make sure to spin some interesting consequences off their action even when they're successful.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165858/#Comment_165858" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T23:28:16+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 11:28PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, wow.<br><br>I can see that you're both right, and that this is not the right game for me to GM, or for us to play.

Sure, you get your goal but High Card says how and what the consequences of you doing so are.  This is an under utilized and under appreciated feature of the game.

Because the power balance is uneven, there's no fun in GMing brutally - pretty soon you've crushed the players dreams and nobody wants to play with you because you had the power to bully and you used it.

The brutality he's talking about isn't one of a bully or enemy. It's the brutality of "story" -- by which I mean: "Someone wants something that they cannot easily have, yet they endeavor to get it anyway, facing trials and difficult choices along the way. In doing so, the person changes."<br/><br/>("The person changes" being the important bit in this case, not "they get/don't get what they want.")<br/><br/>Unfortunately, The Pool doesn't tell you how to make a fit character for the game. So it's possible for someone to screw up, make the guy who wants revenge against the Duke, then goes and confronts the Duke and wins the MOV and says they get revenge. Yawn. The game doesn't have any built-in protection against this, and requires the players to bring a certain sensibility and skill set to the game, especially in how they craft their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165991/#Comment_165991" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T15:53:37+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  3:53PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ultimately I consider the Pool to have been an excellent early test bed of some, at the time, revolutionary and scary design ideas.

It gives you a sheet of information about the character's Spy life and a bunch of information about the character's Guy life and the game says: Put these in conflict.  Then it gives you a mechanism that governs how player contributions enter play.  That's it.  Actually telling an interesting spy story?  Group still has to do that on its own.  The tools help you but you still have to DO it.  The game won't stop you from being bad story tellers.<br/><br/>There are no Guy points that tally against Spy points.

This is why it's one of my favourite games.<br>The GM can try to use Fiat as much as he likes, and the players will roll dice and override him, and throw in a couple of curveballs while there at it.<br>As Dev asked, The Pool really is a collaborative freform game, with a dice roll to resolve differences of opinion  (what we generally call conflicts).<br/>You don't have worry about brutality: when the players lose a roll, or win a roll but don't use a konologue of victory, you the GM get to describe what happens - and you can be as brutal or as mild as you like.<br/>What you should always do (which I imagine you know already), is take account of the character's described abilities - so if a ninja character tries to sneak into a compound and fails, don't describe him failing his stealth roll. Describe him succeeding his stealth roll, but introduce some complication (like, a sudden arrival of a nemesis, or the place he snuck into didn't have what he wanted after all but points him to where he can go). <br/>With that in mind, you never have to fear putting a player in a situation where he needs to roll: every roll should be seen as an opportunity for someone to move the story one way or another - when the GM wins, you can decide to give the player exactly what he wants! If you do, just make sure you throw in a complication or two as well, so it's a springboard to something he wasn't expected.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166132/#Comment_166132" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T12:38:36+00:00" title="August 29, 2008 12:38PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, I didn't say the Pool had GM Fiat, to be clear.

A player can say, "I want to climb this wall," the GM might respond, "okay, make a roll," and the player could say, "Dude, I'm a ninja!" The GM would rightly pause, think, "oh yes - tell me how you scale the wall."<br/>Notice that the GM could have described how the character went over the wall - but Authority means he has veto, not that he has to be the one contributing all the color. As in other narration-trading games (and many other games for that matter), the one with authority can invite contributions from others, or let someone else do the talking.<br/><br/>Also, you're odds are a little off. You said:<br/>"Once player one had squandered his pool, the rules allow me to give him either a 16%, 33%, or 50% chance of resisting whatever I happen to be narrating, never more than that "<br/>First: the odds for 1-3 dice are 17% (round nearest! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>), 31%, and 42% <br/>That said, it should not be hard for players to use one of their ratings on almost any task, especially if they have a relationship or trait relating to factors external to the character and add the 1-3 dice the GM gives them. A starting character could be rolling 6 dice on some tasks without spending anything from the pool (a rating of 3 dice, plus the 3 dice from the GM).<br/>Notice the ratings that the sample character in the Pool has: one of them is something like "Purple Plague." The GM might say, "You're attempt to sneak out the city is tough, roll. Here's two gift dice." the player says, "Okay, I'm using the Purple Plague trait." GM: "Say what?" Player: "hey, that plague always crops up when I'm around - and who knows, maybe it's reached the city and caused a panic - giving me cover to get out." GM, "o...kay. Roll the damn dice." Player picks up all five of the dice for the rating in his favourite chaos-inducing trait, and the two GM dice...<br/>If the player then failed, something to do with the Purple Plague is still a factor, but the GM decides how it applies. Maybe the character's attempt to flee the city is thwarted because it's now under quarantine, and the authorities are looking for a particular character who is always around when the plague stikes...<br/>Ratings in the pool are not strictly about effectiveness, but the direction people want to move the story.<br/><br/>Edit: I should add - I'm not ignoring your concerns about the GM-Fiat-like apparent nature of the rules. In fact, I was put of the game initially for exactly the same reason. It took me a few sessions to realise that I was wrong about that, and it's not really like that at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166169/#Comment_166169" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T16:18:09+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  4:18PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2008 4:19PM by Dave Younce.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite>When a rule says that a perosn has Narrational Authority, it only means the buck stops with him - he doesn't have to be the one narrating.</blockquote>\ngranted, of course.
