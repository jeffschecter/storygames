I think it's basically OK, but I'd like to hear if there are any ways to make it better, or if there is something obvious I've missed or could change. <br/><br/>Examples of things you like about similar mechanics in other games are very welcome, as well. I haven't played enough games with this kind of mechanic to have a whole lot of actual play experience with them, so I'd like to hear how well or poorly you think this might work. (For disclosure, I'm well aware this mechanic isn't revolutionary or groundbreaking.)<br/><br/><b>The Mechanic: Key Traits</b><br/><br/>Key Traits are major Flags for the characters (somewhat like Keys in TSoY). They come in four categories (which are mechanically identical): Passions, Beliefs, Flaws, and Bonds.<br/><br/>In character creation, each player chooses two different categories and writes up one of each. For each one, he or she describes a shared history/relationship to another character in the r-map based on the Key Trait.<br/><br/>To create a Key Trait, you write a sentence or phrase in the first person describing that Trait.<br/><br/><b>Examples</b><br/><i><br/>Passion</i><br/><br/>A pursuit, love, or desire, whether for a person, a thing, or an accomplishment.<br/><br/>\u2022       "I lust for Princess Camilla."<br/>\u2022       "I desire to be the first to climb Mount Grondell."<br/>\u2022       "I dream of stealing the Winter Crown."<br/><br/><i>Belief</i><br/><br/>A strongly held conviction or moral belief that the character holds<br/>dear. It may also take the form of a promise or vow the character has<br/>taken.<br/><br/>\u2022       "I refuse to let injustice go unpunished."<br/>\u2022       "I have vowed to die a virgin."<br/>\u2022       "I believe the lives of the noble Sengali bloodline are more<br/>valuable than the lives of the base-born."<br/>\u2022       "I am a devout Catholic priest."<br/><br/><i>Flaw</i><br/><br/>The character suffers from some serious in flaw in mind or body,<br/>social position, or moral character.<br/><br/>\u2022       "I can't go a day without my opium."<br/>\u2022       "I'll do anything if the price is right."<br/>\u2022       "I suffer from terrible indecision, especially when stakes are high."<br/><br/><i>Bond</i><br/><br/>A Bond is a powerful experience or memory you share with another<br/>person or group of people, which connects you to them, through bonds<br/>of love, friendship, or loyalty. You could have a Bond to a family<br/>member, loved one, war buddy, childhood friend, or even a beloved pet.<br/>Bonds can represent functional relationships or disfunctional ones, as<br/>you wish.<br/><br/>\u2022       "I survived the Massacre of Akanstul because of Sir Jeffers."<br/>\u2022       "My sister stopped me from committing suicide after my wife died."<br/>\u2022       "I crossed the Aranzak desert with Ben the Swindler."<br/><br/><b>Key Traits in Play</b><br/><br/>\u2022       Through actions or speech, you make a Key Trait apparent to someone for the first time. Immediately gain [small advantage]<br/>\u2022       Through actions of speech, you reveal something new about one of your Key Traits. Immediately gain [small advantage]<br/>\u2022       You take a course of action or make a decision motivated by one of your Key Traits despite significant risk to yourself or to the inconvenience or discomfort of others. Or, make a significant sacrifice because of a Key Trait. Immediately gain [moderate advantage and long-term XP-type bonus]<br/>\u2022       You pursue a course of action or make a decision motivated by one of your Key Traits despite mortal danger or in a way that put others in great risk or difficulty. Or, you make a huge sacrifice because of a Key Trait. Immediately gain [major advantage and long-term XP-type bonus]<br/><br/><i>The "advantage" thing is somewhat like adding dice to your Pool in The Pool, but don't worry about that.</i><br/><br/><b>Inverting Key Traits</b><br/><br/>At a suitable juncture in the story, you may feel that your character has experienced a significant transformation: your character has a change of heart, finds his or her ideals shattered, experiences his or her love or loyalty turn to hatred, or even learns to respect or love their enemy. To express this, you can choose to invert a Key Trait. Announce your intention to do so and rewrite the Key Trait so that it expresses an opposite or wildly different outlook. Inverting a Key<br/>Trait might corrupt or redeem your character, depending whether you see the trait being inverted as a positive or a negative one.<br/><br/>\u2022       When you invert a Key Trait immediately [gain major advantage and huge long-term XP-type bonus]<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Please share your wisdom!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174596/#Comment_174596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-11T15:59:32+00:00" title="October 11, 2008  3:59PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks pretty good.  My concern is that, depending on the way the trait is written, it may be either very hard to bring in a Key Trait, or very hard not to.  For example, "I crossed the Aranzak Desert with Ben the Sidewinder" is a cool bit of history, but we don't have a lot of information about how that motivates the character.  I'm finding it hard to imagine someone "making a huge sacrifice" for this trait.  <br/><br/>Looking at Keys from TSoY, you'll see that they're all very concrete, specific things, that in play are usually not very ambiguous.  For me, it's always an uncomfortable moment when I'm casting around for ways to improve the odds of a roll.  I think as much as possible, avoiding edge cases and ambiguity is a good idea.  <br/><br/>I think a simple fix would be to include very specific instructions about the kinds of Key Traits that work, and how to write them in such a way that they produce concrete, tangible results. <br/><br/>I'm also worried about inverting Key Traits.  I think that's a vital part of the mechanic, and I'd be more worried if it wasn't there.  I guess I'm just thinking about TSoY keys again, where buying off a Key is tied to a specific action in the game.  To buy off your Key, you actually have to do something tangible, and often game-altering.  It's a change of action, not just of intention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174597/#Comment_174597" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-11T15:59:38+00:00" title="October 11, 2008  3:59PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems good to me. I'd allow characters to have more or less Key Traits than the default two, but I might be thinking through the Solar System too much here. The in-play bonuses are solid, I might steal them for my own purposes at some point.<br/><br/>The only weak point is that determining whether a given sacrifice is "insignificant", "significant" or "major" seems like a hassle. I like to write Solar System Keys to emphasize <i>qualitative</i> changes in situation for this very reason: if the small reward comes from verbally abusing your wife and the big one from physically hurting her, to coin an example, then nobody needs to make a call about whether a given action is "significant" or "major".<br/><br/>Solar System gets around this problem by writing each Key on a case-by-case basis, but if you want a more general solution, that may take some work. I might personally look for some setting-wide thematic logic - for example, in some setting it might make sense to have anything that draws blood count as "major", while anything that doesn't is "significant".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174598/#Comment_174598" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-11T16:28:07+00:00" title="October 11, 2008  4:28PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does it matter if when connecting to other PC's, someone connects to a PC "already connected to"?<br/><br/>E.G., if among A, B, C, D that A connects to B, B to A, C to B and D to A?

But the actual Bond is to Ben himself, so you would making sacrifices, etc, for <i>Ben</i> himself. Make sense?<br/><br/>Eero, yes! You can buy more Key Traits as you play, very much Solar System-style. I am, basically, just trying to write a generic formula for Keys, suited to this diffrent game.<br/><br/>I also stole an element from your booklet for all of these: each instance has to relate to a significant, in-play event in the story. So, you can't just "invert a Trait" for no good reason. Your character has to do something that the other players find meaningful for the development of the story. Is there a better way to handle this?<br/><br/>As for the "sacrifice" bit, I totally agree. I actually just added the "sacrifices" in as I was posting this, whereas the rest of the text was written previously. How can I improve this? I'm thinking that the "lesser" sacrifice is when you give up something good for you because of a Key Trait. The "greater" sacrifice is one that is really shocking or surprising to the other players, like when you give up something really vital or important to your character. Or should I just take that out again? I definitely want to include making significant sacrifices somehow.<br/><br/>Rob, the idea for setup is that you all brainstorm a small set of characters together (GM included). Then, as you pick Traits, you draw the connections, either to PCs or NPCs, as you wish. In my experience, what you describe isn't a problem. First of all, the total pool of characters is very small, so an "outlier" is really, really unlikely. Second, players (in my experience, again) tend to police themselves about it, since I draw the connections on paper. <br/><br/>"Hey, look, Dogma doesn't have any connections to us--how about for your next Trait you connect to her?"<br/><br/>And all the characters are pre-defined as being part of the same community, so I don't foresee that being a problem anyway.<br/><br/>Please keep the comments coming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174600/#Comment_174600" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-11T16:50:38+00:00" title="October 11, 2008  4:50PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the issue of evaluating the situation is the same whether we're discussing sacrifices, risks or difficulties, really.

That's a judgement call, which might or might not bother you.

The minor category would include any sacrifice that is large enough to bother the character himself, while the major category would include anything that has lasting impact. Thus, to coin an example, breaking the trust of your friend for the sake of some other consideration would be major only if the break was permanent, while otherwise it would be minor.<br/><br/>Then again, requiring permanent changes again comes very close to a Key buyoff condition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
