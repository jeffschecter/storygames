So players roll d4, d6, d8, d12, or d20, or pass.<br/><br/>Highest roll frames the scene: Where, Who's There, and Agenda.  This person also has the power to end the scene if hte Agenda has been met.  <br/>Lowest roll DMs the scene.<br/>This gives players a chance to say "Hey, I'll DM" or "Hey, I know what should happen next" or "I have no idea, I'm sitting back for a bit."<br/><br/>The Scene Framer has the power to end the scene if the Agenda has been met, after which you roll for a new scene.<br/><br/>EDIT: The TRAP cards give the current DM ideas of what to add that might not be expected.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108139/#Comment_108139" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T14:53:40+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  2:53PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2007 2:54PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds less "DMless" and more "rotating DM with split authority."  Which, I think might be more rewarding than a pure DMless game (or, more to the point, a game where the DM role is fulfilled by a purely mechanical force, not unlike the various cooperative board games out there like Shadows Over Camelot or Arkham Horror.)<br/><br/>I don't mean to be splitting hairs with the distinction, but I think there's some fruit if you look at how you're proposing to split authority and pass it around, rather than get trapped in a "this is DMless" mode of thought.<br/><br/>This begs the question:  What is it about being D&amp;D and being DMless that you desire?

Are you okay with the idea with combining yourself as the DM with some form of unpredictable setup?  In many ways, that would be you more as a facilitator between the unpredcitable dungeon &amp; the other players.  I ask this because I think moving to a round-robin authority set-up may (not will, but may) diminish senses of camaraderie in the players.  Maybe the PCs as well, but there's nothing unifying the players towards some in-story goal when one is routinely tasked to frame the scene or DM.<br/><br/>Another follow-up would be to ask why that makes you feel guilty?  Changing the dynamic might only make things worse if it causes the game to fizzle out a little more.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think your idea is definitely worth playtesting, though perhaps outside of any current campaign baggage to get a clearer analysis of how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108155/#Comment_108155" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T16:17:07+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  4:17PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2007 4:19PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Well...

That's really what D&amp;D is as far as I'm concerned - a variable amount of soft roleplay tissue around a hard core skeleton of carefully callibrated gamist action scenes.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to think that D&amp;D fight scenes need to be designed like amusement rides and thus require "considered design".  Creatures need to be in locations that work for them (e.g., the flying creature with 10' reach needs to be in a chamber at least 20' fall so it can hover over victims who can't attack back without reach weapons, spells etc.) and the interaction of physical and other elements considered.<br/><br/>E.g., the last big fight scene I ran having skeletal remains of foes previously killed in chamber, apparently there mostly to make some squares more difficult footing, show how dangerous it was and have stuff on them to be looted later, suddenly stand up all over the place as uber-skeletal warriors - changing the tactical battlefield, also giving clerics and area-affect damage Sorcerer-guy something to do when the primary foes were all immune to spells and thus reducing their contribution/ability to be cool etc., at same time preventing the (large # of characters) PC party from just swamping the big foes.<br/><br/>I'm just putting finishing touches on major fight scenes for next adventure and the "major ones" involve showcasing a monster's abilities (blindsense monster that doesn't need to see in an area of illusory walls it ignores etc., the creatures with no supernatural/magic abilities being located in the antimagic zone that doesn't reduce their abilities).<br/><br/>People who want lots of player-creative authority ultimately probably should be playing a different game.  You can take D&amp;D a long way into "player-centered" activity (Ryan does) but I think "the high altar of the demon god chamber" is the heart of where players want the GM to "surprise them with something cool that maybe with great player skills they could have seen coming".<br/><br/>My players are, perversely, often happiest being surprised by something they know they should not have been surprised by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108927/#Comment_108927" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T22:30:53+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 10:30PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>The guilt is from the fact that the game is on hiatus (semi-dead), although that was inevitable anyway due to my 4 week old daughter here.</blockquote>\nThat would definitely suggest that a different mechanical element wouldn't actually fix your problem.<br/>Even if the mechanic changes who's responsible for creativity and opposition in the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108997/#Comment_108997" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T10:18:20+00:00" title="November 20, 2007 10:18AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just in case anyone is interested.  <a href="http://wso.williams.edu/~msulliva/campaigns/ag/framework.html" rel="nofollow">The Framework</a> might have some interesting ideas to plumb for DMless or rotating DMless play with traditional systems.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
