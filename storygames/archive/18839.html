I was wondering if there are any resources you could recommend for a more general approach to designing storytelling/RPG games? I'm kinda new at this, and I'm sure experience will go a long way, but whilst I can read stuff, having not played enough, I don't always see the reasons behind design choices. On the other hand, recurring issues or problems with games would also be a good point to learn from. <br/><br/>I ask for pointers as I do believe storytelling games are probably the least rule-adhering games to design, but I'm generally looking for a bit of footing to work from. What I've got in mind is a storytelling game guided by some game mechanics. Think Fiasco for example, a system with a lot of liberty on how to flesh out your story, but very specific steps that ensure certain aspects of the game. <br/><br/>Hope you have some links, pointers, notable failures, pitfalls, articles, anything for me! <br/><br/>Thanks!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421918/#Comment_421918" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T08:39:02+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  8:39AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <i>best</i> way is to get direct experience with games of all stripes. Watch and experience play, and figure out how the game accomplished that effect (or if it wasn't the game but the players). There's not really an "approach" to designing a more story-based game, just a bunch of tools that are constantly being invented, discovered, and refined.<br/><br/>I'd particularly recommend <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/toc/categories" rel="nofollow">Vincent Baker's musings</a>. They're especially designed as thought-provoking statements about design in games, and the correlation of fiction and gaming. Find somewhere to start, and dig in!<br/><br/>Specific games I'd recommend looking at: Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, and (as a wildcard that doesn't get pegged a lot here) John Wick's "Blood &amp; Honor".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421925/#Comment_421925" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T09:52:48+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  9:52AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play as many games as you can, and read even more. Constantly be asking "why did they do this? What's the point?" Every rule has two effects: what it says on paper and what it does at the table. Sometimes it's not obvious until you see it in play, but the more you play games the easier it becomes to just read a text and go "oh, right, we reward failure in this case because it incentivizes this certain behavior, I get it..." or whatever. I've found that reading theory is really helpful but I've probably gotten more out of reading and playing the actual stuff in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421926/#Comment_421926" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T10:38:22+00:00" title="September 25, 2013 10:38AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're anywhere near New Jersey, consider attending Metatopia (Nov 1-3, I think).

That is, I pick up a neat mechanism or two from other people's games once in a while, but I learn so much more from just trying things out in play and seeing what they do. Hell, even mulling ideas over and thinking about how it would work and fit together is really useful. I designed about 50 (I'm not even joking) games before my first published one, and I still design and partially write down maybe 10 games for every published game (I've published three, soon four, now working on my fifth). And about three games make it to playtesting for every game I release.<br/><br/>And do playtest. A lot. I've noticed that my published games have little in common with the first version I brought to playtest. Also, don't listen too much to your playtesters. They will resist changes if they have played earlier versions and they'll think your game is fine when it actually needs a big redesign.<br/><br/>Other random tip: Think in terms of cycles and trends. What happens when this value goes up? What other values will tend to go up? How will this affect rolls? What will that effect on the rolls have on the value? Things like death spirals and feedback loops are great tools if you're aware of them but can ruin your game if you're not. A great way to build a game is to design it around a cycle. People will do A, which makes B happen. When B happens, C will get easier and A more difficult, so people will do C. C, in turn, will eventually trigger D, at which point A is again the easier option. Stuff like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421930/#Comment_421930" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T11:01:34+00:00" title="September 25, 2013 11:01AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If anyone has any recommended reading (especially GM-less, cooperative storytelling affairs)?<br/><br/>New Jersey, how far is that from Belgium? <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/></blockquote>\nFrench or Flemish Belgian?

The obvious answer would be to decrease the length of each.  Instead, they added additional frames of animation to the reload animation, giving it more detail.  And they lowered the player's camera angle, so that they were closer to the ground and therefore felt that they were going faster (when they still moved the same speed).</blockquote>\nThis was Borderlands.

I find that it can be really hard to break that mold when I attempt board game design. Perhaps board games need mechanics to do more specific things and are thus generally rather unavoidable. <br/><br/>I'm loving all the resources you've been posting! I've read all the linked articles and am now delving deeper into the vault. <br/><br/>The video game quote really hit home for me as well, especially since my main inspiration for my project is in fact a video game.

You don't need to cross the Atlantic for it. I'm sure there are a few in Belgium and France (tell me if you find a good one, I've been meaning to try a convention in French!). Or you could go to Gothenburg (Sweden) during Easter for GothCon. The "indie room" always has loads of great people playing all kinds of interesting games, and pretty much everyone is comfortable gaming in English.
