I've made a new thing, a game of goblin commandos. <br/><br/>Here's the pitch:<br/><br/>You are a crack commando in the Twilight Lord\u2019s army. You are also a goblin: Short, green and full of unpleasant habits. <br/><br/>You are tasked with all the awful jobs, sent deep into enemy territory and likely to die. So are your 11 comrades. You are the last of the 23rd Rifles, The Filthy Dozen.<br/><br/>Will your goblin survive? Just what use is a ritual spork and a jar of eels? Is the Tonks and Spalding Grenado as unreliable as its reputation suggests? Can you achieve enough to avoid punishment by the powers that be? What dubious secrets lurk in your goblin\u2019s past? What seeds of rebellion have been sown? All these questions and more will be answered.<br/><br/>A roleplaying game for 3-6 players. Featuring goblin mayhem, satire and grotesquery.<br/><br/>Inspired by World War 2 movies, the books of Terry Pratchett and Bernard Cornwell and 3:16.<br/><br/><a href="https://realms.co.uk/the-filthy-dozen" rel="nofollow">General info on my site</a> and it's <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/207080/The-Filthy-Dozen?affiliate_rem=2909" rel="nofollow">available over on RPGNow</a> <br/><br/>-Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
