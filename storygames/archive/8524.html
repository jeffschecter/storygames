I'm thinking here of actual play with games which span more than one play session, and which may require some degree of prep by some participants.<br/><br/>In my group we use wikis a lot, we didn't always but we've found them a very useful tool.  The current game is at <a href="http://cursushonorum.pbwiki.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cursushonorum.pbwiki.com/</a> and there's a link there to other games we've run and may come back to.  The wiki helps keep track of who's who, acts as a record of actual play (which is useful when someone can't make it, which given we're all adults with jobs happens a fair bit) and since we prefer traditional GM/player structures helps save prep time by collating the game's history in one central location.<br/><br/>So, what tools do you use?  I'm interested in any practical suggestions, for example Jason Morningstar in his <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7781&amp;page=1#Item_46" rel="nofollow">Big Store game</a> circulated a briefing pack before the game and part way through a relationship map both of which struck me as really good ideas for that game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188967/#Comment_188967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T06:36:53+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  6:36AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have never used a wiki for my games, but I've been in a number of groups that had pre-wiki websites that were pretty much equivalent as sources of knowledge. These included campaign diaries, who's who lists, definitions of common terms, house rules and so forth.<br/><br/>They are a great resource, and also a wonderful way to keep an archive of past games and then look back at them in a nostalgic sense.

I'm not really into Wikis, because it's just another thing I have to be aware of, and rarely end up using them.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188993/#Comment_188993" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T08:21:02+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  8:21AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We use a vanilla forum like this one for some amount of prep, sorting out the dates and post-game comments.

I also use the GUMSHOE one for pre-gens (NPCs are easy) - it should be out sometime this year.<br/><br/>We use CC for mapping if it's complicated or 4e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188996/#Comment_188996" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T08:27:19+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  8:27AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I took a view a couple of years back that I no longer wish to play anything requiring (or even notably benefitting from) a character generator.
