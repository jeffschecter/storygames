Its most central feature is a mechanic for dealing with fear which - I hope - will not suck. This is my wishlist of things I want it to do:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Not remove control of the character from the player (i.e. no "you rolled a 5, so according to this table you soil yourself and pass out")<br/>\n* Be interesting enough to the player that "rolling a fear check" doesn't become the dreaded mood-killer it tends to be in other games<br/>\n* Have the potential of giving a character greater, rather than lesser, ability if frightened (panicked adrenaline bursts)<br/>\n* Notwithstanding the above, not encourage the player to keep the character in a mentally unbalanced state<br/>\n<br/>\nMy idea of this so far:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Allow the system to affect dice mechanics only and allow players to interpret how their characters are actually affected in the fiction.<br/>\n* Have a "track" ranging from -5 to +5, with balanced characters at +/-0. As characters do fear checks, they have the ability to either climb or drop on the track, thereby increasing or decreasing their abilities.<br/>\n* Give a character a permanent instability (derangement) if they drop off the chart, either above or below.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's some more details but that's the gist of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat say you? Are there any glaring holes or inconsistencies? Am I naive in thinking this mechanic could work for the purposes I outlined? Is it possible to reinvent a fear mechanic in a way that does not suck?<br/>\nIt seems a little mechanical and clumsy to me - I had hoped for something a bit more intuitive and inventive. If you have any suggestions, please throw them my way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81518/#Comment_81518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T13:24:17+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  1:24PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Preface: This is not meant to be insulting.<br/><br/>As someone else who is writing up notes here and there about a survival horror RPG (which is based on me wanting a good story-game system that I can use to run my old GURPS "Disneyland with Zombies" game), I think I understand what I don't want to do in it -- I don't want to have the GM tell me when I should think about being afraid.<br/><br/>The reason I said the preface is because your post knocked this idea loose in my head, and I wanted to thank you for that, not sound like I'm trying to tell you what to do.

So many of these systems are very bad in this respect.  For inspiration, perhaps you could look to how "trust" works in The Mountain Witch.  Rather than being told how much you trust each other, and having to play accordingly, you play, and assign trust based on how your character is feeling.  <br/><br/>Translated to your game, perhaps a mechanic where people assign fear to their own characters, based on how they're feeling, and fear points can be used for mechanical advantage and disadvantage.  Perhaps they're advantageous when dealing with zombies, but are a hindrance when trying to do anything else.  So, for example, if you're terrified (you've given yourself lots of fear points) you get a big bonus to beating the zombies with your baseball bat, but you get a comensurate penalty when you're trying to convince people to follow your lead later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81539/#Comment_81539" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T16:41:42+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  4:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I'm a teensy bit confused about your post - do you mean if any of the ideas that you have posted elsewhere knocks something loose in my head?</blockquote>\nWhat I meant by that was if my little idea is worthwhile to you, feel free to steal it.  I haven't actually written any of my notes down electronically, more like scraps of paper and mental notes like "not taking a baby = increase personal doom" -- notes that only really make full sense to me.<br/><br/>I also think that I got distracted and forgot to post up the second part of the idea:  I want to fiddle with dice so that in addition to success or failure, whether fear is generated is also figured out.  This makes the alertness roll idea (which is a nice way to build tension if you do it right) perhaps a bit more interesting, because then it's not just "do I see the monster or not", but also "am I more afraid or not?"  Shoot, you could unlink the two, so that determining fear &amp; determining success happen simultaneously, but you can get all four options somehow: success + no fear, success + fear, failure + no fear, failure + fear.  In any case, there's no "hey, check if your afraid now!" response.<br/><br/>That's the part I didn't post up, which is one of those "notes in my head" now for my game idea.  That's specifically what I intended you to feel free to steal if it seems interesting to you, though everything else in the world is fair game too (provided you're willing to accept the consequences for really blatant thefts <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>(Also, another idea just occurred, involving increasingly easy alertness rolls over time as the horror is more and more revealed.  Along with that, a system that encourages the players to call for such rolls.)\n<blockquote>By the way, my master plan is: Become a good enough game designer to warrant being interviewed on Master Plan! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nAwesome!

I will let them percolate for a little while and see if anything meshes with the remainder of the system. Ryan, you did actually manage to knock something loose for me - I had made the assumption that I must have traditional, separate "fear checks", never considering to make them a side effect of other checks like skill checks. I will have to consider that to see if I can somehow work it in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and by all that is holy, I hope that your definition of "personal doom" isn't the same as mine.

The cool thing about Madness dice is you dont <em>have</em> to take them, but they help you win. Of course, the more you use em the more chance you have that they start to hurt you. Similar thing could be done in a zombie smackdown, where your fear can keep you awake or give you a burst of speed or superhuman strength. But then you have to live with the consequences as your fear level rachets up, cuz once you give in to fear it starts a cascade where regaining your composure gets harder and harder.

That fear now acts as a kind of ability which can be used to achieve goals, but it grows everytime it's used, until at some point it's either confirmed or dismissed.<br/><br/>And other players can invoke that fear too, or even adopt it as their own, to help them achieve THEIR goals.

Do what you want -- after all, working on that may generate a better idea later that you wouldn't have come to if you didn't work on it.  Also, there's no guarantee that you'll publish this game, so do what you want.  Finally, you're likely to beat me to publishing even if you do, because I'm not working on this game right now.  All that is to say: don't let someone else doing something stop you.<br/><br/>But to be specific: for me, Doom is the ever-increasing difficult based on the actions you take.  One of the things I admire about survival horror films is that there's an element of humanity in them -- the guy who saves the baby *might* be killed, but the couple that sneaks away from responsibility to go have sex *will* be killed.  There's personal Doom &amp; global Doom in my game, based on something I did ad-hoc in my GURPS "zombies in Disneyland" game: if you rescued the baby, the swarms of zombies would take longer to get to you.  If you didn't, you were fucked.  I never told the players that, and in many games they argued over whether to take the baby, but they always did -- it's the act that counts, not the bickering beforehand.  What I'm looking for in a Doom system is something like Lacuna's Static.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82498/#Comment_82498" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T12:53:51+00:00" title="July 20, 2007 12:53PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I nailed it! Let me know what you think. Points I've changed as a result of this conversation is marked with an asterisk.<br/><br/>1. Characters have two balanced stats totaling 10 - Cool and Care. Cool represents how much stress they can take without blinking. Care represents how much emotional duress they can be suffer and still hold it together. No stat can be lower than 3 or higher than 7 to begin with.<br/>2. There is a "Fright level" that escalates during the course of a scenario. It normally spans between 1 and 10. Characters begin dealing with death around level 5.<br/>*3. In any skill test done in a stressful situation, if the Fright level exceeds your Cool, add one die to your pool for each level of difference.<br/>*4. Each extra die rolled has a chance of being converted into a Panic point, but also counts towards success. You are more likely to get Panic points if you fail at the roll than if you succeed.<br/>*5. When Panic exceeds your Care, you shut down - faint, go catatonic, suffer muscular blackout, whatever. You have to reduce your Panic (through various means) below Care to regain control.<br/><br/>Panic points replaces Doom, no worries Ryan. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Panic makes more sense, with the above modifications.<br/><br/>Let me know if anything is whacked with this.

I'll make sure that I work on the wording on this in the draft.<br/><br/>Example #1: The Narc<br/>Joe is an undercover officer in LAPD's narc squad with considerable on-the-job experience. He's seen some ugly shit in the line of duty, and as a result his player decides to pick a Cool of 6, and thus a Care of 4. Character wise, the low Care rating means that Joe has sacrificed attachments to life that others take for granted - family, friends, faith, hope. Mechanically, this means that Joe will be able to operate normally in the face of sights that would make others cringe. However, once the Fright level escalates above levels that are considered routine for Joe, it won't take much to mess him up - essentially for his body to go "Screw this shit, it ain't worth it!"<br/><br/>Example #2: The librarian<br/>Sheila is a librarian in any given library that does not reside on the Miskatonic University campus. Her player decides that she hasn't been subjected to a whole lot of the world's evils, having lived a fairly sheltered life in a pretty little suburban neighbourhood. She takes a Cool of 4 and gets a Care of 6, which to her character means that she is easily frightened, but she copes well - she's not likely to give up, she's got too much to live for and too many people that depend on her. The moment the Fright level escalates above 4, she will start to feel the effects of it, but until she has accumulated Panic points in excess of 6 she will only benefit from the additional stress - it makes her try harder and go faster.<br/><br/>Note that the game doesn't support two types of characters - the zombie-killing Badass that doesn't stop firing until his arm gets bitten off (high Cool, high Care, played by Bruce Campbell) and the Victim that freezes up with an eardrum busting shriek the moment she lays eyes on a shambling corpse (low Cool, low Care, played by any big-breasted blonde). Other games would do these better - for example, All Flesh and Call of Cthulhu, respectively. This game is about characters that either conquers their fear and gets people out of trouble, or who succumbs to their fear and drags people down to hell with them. As such, it's important for these stats to be balanced, so that everyone in the game has a shot at both options above.<br/><br/>Thanks for asking the question, and allowing me the chance to verbalize that. If something in it still doesn't jibe with you, let me know!<br/><br/>Ryan, are those enough examples or are you fishing for an actual use of the mechanics a la a skill roll? Let me know and I can do that as well, though it may be lengthy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83134/#Comment_83134" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T06:31:59+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  6:31AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to risk a breach of netiquette protocol and bump my own post.<br/>If nobody is interested in commenting on the system further, feel free to let the thread fade into oblivion once more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83317/#Comment_83317" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T14:24:18+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  2:24PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2007 2:49PM by Thomas D.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All I have to say is this thread is chock full of good brainstorming things.

A low rank represents someone who is exceptionally well grounded and somewhat of a skeptic, while a character with a high rank in Insanity is loopy and believes in all sorts of occult things. The benefits of a low rank are that the character is less likely to loose control in a spooky situation (more likely to succeed a fear check), and is hardened against occult or psychic influences. The drawback of a low rank is that in spooky situations the character's chances of skill or combat success is restricted by the Insanity rank. The benefits of a high rank in Insanity is that even though you have a reduced chance of not flipping out, if you do make your fear check you are far more effective because your skills and actions are less restricted by your high Insanity rank. The consequences of failing a fear check for every character is that they <b>have</b> to choose between fight or flight - either they attack the horror directly or do everything they can to get away. Every time a character makes a fear check - win or lose - their Insanity rank increases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83383/#Comment_83383" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T19:17:35+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  7:17PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2007 7:17PM by noclue.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite><br> If something in it still doesn't jibe with you, let me know! </br></blockquote>\nActually, that worked for me.

My major inspiration for this mechanic is the Night of the Living Dead (at least the remake) where <br/><br/>*spoiler alert*<br/><br/>badass after badass makes stupid decisions - or succumb to infighting - and turn zombie chow, but the "innocent, incompetent female victim" we're introduced to in the beginning goes through a major, though gradual, transformation into this headband-wearing, shotgun-wielding zombie slaying machine when under pressure.<br/><br/>*end spoiler*<br/><br/>The other piece to this puzzle is the very generous character advancement model, but that's a story for another time.<br/><br/>John, having not played Pulp-Fu I don't know exactly how that mechanic plays out in practice, but it sounds neat. Are there any particular points in that system that come out especially well in play? For example, you might say "I really like how a low Insanity benefits you when you're in very tactical combats, but the reverse is true when you're fighting a single horrific, supernatural Big Bad" or whatever (I don't know if that's true or not, or if it even applies).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83397/#Comment_83397" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T22:57:48+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:57PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2007 10:58PM by Calvino.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I see it, you gotta ask yourself, "Do I want the <i>characters</i> to be afraid, or the <i>players</i>"?<br/><br/>If you wanna make a game where people sit around and tell stories about people who get really scared, then a fear mechanic is fine and dandy, but if you wanna make a game that <i>scares</i> people then I personally have a hard time seeing what a fear mechanic would contribute.

Tension and suspense, sure. Never fear.<br/><br/>Kult, in particular, thrives on placing characters in danger and fucked up situations (think Hellraiser). With virgin players who know nothing of the setting, you can get a bit of a raise out of them when the Illusion shatters in the middle of your final exam, the invigilator starts bleeding profusely from underneath their fingernails, the blood seeping down the aisle towards your desk, where it turns into horrible clawed arms that reach up and starts tearing your paper apart, you black out, and the next thing you know you're in the Dean's Office trying to come up with some reasonable explanation why you stabbed pencil holes in your exam papers, shrieked and stormed out, in order not to get expelled.<br/><br/>Maybe.<br/><br/>After the fourth or fifth fucked up thing happens, you can no longer up the ante to continue to instill that type of response, and the players tend to just yawn and pick up the Fear dice - if they pass, they'll pick up their Kalashnikov and just "deal with the problem".<br/><br/>Having not felt personal "fear" from watching a horror flick for the past umpteen years (though <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/" rel="nofollow">The Ring</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330500/" rel="nofollow">The Curse</a> came pretty close) I think this is a lost cause, at least for me. I'm perfectly satisfied with settling for "tension" on the player level, leaving "fear" on the character level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83436/#Comment_83436" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T08:29:27+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  8:29AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>And reading the OP, I don't see anything in the wishlist about causing the emotion of fear.

Since the character would prefer, when stressed, to reach a non-stressful situation, I wanted to ensure that the player's motivations would be similar enough to their character's that there wouldn't be a conflict between them.<br/><br/>If I had cut out the Breakdown mechanic, for example, players would be encouraged to just go nuts and kill stuff rather than try to stay cool and survive. That's a totally different game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
