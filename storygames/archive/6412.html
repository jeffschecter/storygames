Features content by Jeff Rients, Paul Czege, Stefan Poag, Gabor Lux, James Maliszewski, Calithena, Andrew Reyes, and many more! Packed with monsters, magic, new rules and character options, four FULL adventures, and much much more! Come unlock your imagination, and keep Fighting On!"</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Calithena</cite>Hi all -<br/><br/>Thanks for the interest in Fight On!  Judd, I picked lulu because it was easy, but I am starting to see some upsides there for a magazine publisher. Low risk/overhead as for any publisher, your stuff is out there for people to see and get easily, etc. The one downside is that if your magazine is small there's less of a margin for reasonable pricing, but since this is essentially a fanzine (the mag makes $1 or less per print copy, a lot of which gets rolled back in) that's not such a big deal for us.<br/><br/>Paul's article is definitely on the edge of the envelope where 'old school' is concerned, but my interpretation of 'old school' is actually pretty broad. Back in the seventies we didn't know everything people know today, and systems were limited and klugy, but the cool thing about it is that everyone would just roll their imagination into what was there and it could all kind of be played, table by table, according to people's preferences. There were indeed some wild west coast campaigns, sometimes influenced by Arduin, that got into the epic/psychedelic range that Paul's contribution was in, where the rules often kind of receded into the mirror (characters could do almost anything) and the play often became either about a kind of crazy one-upsmanship in terms of surreal effects or else about demigod-level...dare I say it...narrativism? Anyway, I don't know how many FO! readers are going to get or use Paul's contribution, but I know I did, and I think the magazine wouldn't serve its roots or its fanbase well if it didn't push the envelope with at least one or two articles an issue dealing with weird situations, rules mods, playstyle variants, and so on. I actually have a few more 'indie designers' in mind I'm going to contact or have already contacted to write things that I think would be useful at least to some in the 'old school' framework. So there you go.<br/><br/>If Story Games people have stuff they would like to submit - either old D&amp;D notes from three-ring binders that they're not likely to use now, or newer, pushing the envelope type stuff that they think might be usefully ad hocced onto older style games, I encourage them to submit - iggyumlaut@gmail.com . All our writers and artsts keep ownership and all other rights to their submissions, all Fight On! asks for is the right to publish the article/artwork in the version it's originally published in in the issue it's originally published in in perpetuity. (Judd, if you ever wanted to publish an old school version of some Mu's Bed stuff, just put it in the mail, I'd find a place for it.)<br/><br/>So anyway, thanks again to all you folks at Story Games for the interest, and Fight On!</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141824/#Comment_141824" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T09:00:49+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  9:00AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>either old D&amp;D notes from three-ring binders that they're not likely to use now, or newer, pushing the envelope type stuff that they think might be usefully ad hocced onto older style games, I encourage them to submit</i><br/><br/>Hey, Sean.<br/><br/>I may do just that.

Truth to tell, I'm kind of overwhelmed in a good way with the positive response to this venture. It's essentially an old-school fanzine - variable production values (though some quite high), different levels of contribution, etc. But it looks like a serious miniatures producer is going to co-sponsor an adventure contest with us, for publication and prizes (this is not final yet, but it seems 90% likely to happen, and it will be announced all over when everything's set); a couple famous people from the old days (names TBA, but you've heard of them) are submitting content or at least blessing others to create content for their games; and in general I think the amount of goodwill for this product has made me really happy. When I'm talking about it to you guys on Story Games and I know that both Dave Arneson and Mike Mearls have shown some interest, I feel like we must be doing something right. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBen, we'd love to have your stuff, old or new, and no need to push any envelopes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the table of contents for the first issue:<br/>\nDedication to Gary Gygax\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026..1<br/>\nThe Devil\u2019s in the Details (Kesher)\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026........3<br/>\nThe Swanmay (Calithena)\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026....4<br/>\nFlexible Sorcery (Jeff Reints &amp; co.)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20264<br/>\nThe Ruined Monastery (James Maliszewski)\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026..7<br/>\nThe Tomb Complex of Ymmu M\u2019Kursa (Gabor Lux).12<br/>\nSetting up your Sandbox (Calithena)\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026..16<br/>\nPuissant Priestly Powers (Santiago Luis Or\xeda)\u2026\u2026\u2026...19<br/>\nEnchanted Holy Symbols (Jeff Reints)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.20<br/>\nNature\u2019s Nasty Node (Makofan)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..20<br/>\nThe Space Wizards (Paul Czege)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..23<br/>\nCreepies &amp; Crawlies (Andrew Reyes &amp; Jeff Rients)\u2026..26<br/>\nIn the Time of the Broken Kingdom (Iggy \xdcmlaut)\u2026.28<br/>\nArtifacts, Adjuncts, and Oddments (various)\u2026\u2026...\u202630<br/>\n<br/>\nIndex of Illustrations &amp; Cartography: cover art by Andrew Reyes; Fight On! logo by Jeff Reints.

Our main subject is old-school fantasy gaming, but that's a pretty broad category. That said, a lot of the meat and potatoes of the magazine are adventures, wilderness areas, magic items, monsters, spells, and similar sorts of things. We write things up in a way that is broadly compatible with a large number of games,the following with little to no conversion work: Arduin, Castles &amp; Crusades, original/brown book D&amp;D, holmes/moldvay/mentzer/allston D&amp;D, Empire of the Petal Throne, Thieves' Guild, Warlock, just to name a few. However, there are also a certain number of system-neutral and add-on-mechanics type articles. We're more about the ideas and the DIY than the mechanical presentation, in the end. But if you're looking for the content to be directly gameable out of the book you'll do better if you're playing an 'old school fantasy' sort of system, or can easily convert out of one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also accept articles (especially adventures) for Empire of the Petal Throne, Mazes &amp; Minotaurs (original and revised), Encounter Critical, and Forward: to Adventure!, all with the blessing of those games' authors and publishers. If you want to write for another old-school fantasy game or give permission for us to use yours, just let us know: I can try to contact principals on your behalf if the article proposal sounds interesting enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141910/#Comment_141910" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T17:33:30+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  5:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OSRIC is a current system that would be a good fit for FO!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141912/#Comment_141912" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T17:37:16+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  5:37PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes indeedy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142007/#Comment_142007" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T10:30:36+00:00" title="May  2, 2008 10:30AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got my copy last night and I've already read most of it.

The adventures are quite diverse and interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
