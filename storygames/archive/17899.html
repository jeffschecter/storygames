It smashed through it in within eight hours and kept going. Right now it's on \xa34400, and the first two stretch goals are unlocked. The third is a completely new setting and adventure for the Fugue mechanics that drive the game.<br/><br/><b><i>Alas Vegas</i></b> isn't exactly a story-game, but it's not exactly an RPG either. There's a GM and players, but while the GM runs the game in the present, the players control the mechanics for rebuilding their memories and therefore their pasts... which will eventually explain how they came to start the game by clawing their way out of shallow graves on the edge of the desert outside a massive, bizarre casino city. I'm really pleased with it, I think it's some of the best game-design work I've ever done.<br/><br/>There's lots more information on the Kickstarter page, and I'm happy to answer questions if you have them.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameswallis/alas-vegas-an-rpg-of-bad-memories-bad-luck-and-bad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameswallis/alas-vegas-an-rpg-of-bad-memories-bad-luck-and-bad</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405070/#Comment_405070" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T18:58:02+00:00" title="January 30, 2013  6:58PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks cool, I'm in!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
