I'm running this little thought experiment in my head, and I'm trying to figure the balance between mechanical resolution within a game and the contributions of fiction that the players make.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, we were playing <em>Tribe 8</em> and at the climax of the giant epic face-off, Mo rolled this awesome critical success and it created an incredible sense of satisfaction and completion for the story.  The dice gave us the awesome, there, or at least gave us permission to bring the awesome.<br/><br/>Once upon a different time, we were playing <em>Primetime Adventures</em> and Michael was playing a priest.  One NPC came up to him and asked, "You're a priest, right, and if I tell you something in confession, you can't tell anybody else?"  Then another did, then another, and so on.  Four or five NPCs kept piling baggage on top of him, all in the course of one episode.  It was a very cool motif, and really gave the episode a sense of structure, and it came not from the in-game resolution but from elsewhere -- in this case, the inspiration of his character concept.  And the thing of it is, that contribution to the fiction inspired lots of later uses of the resolution mechanics.<br/><br/>So I'm looking for the latter: what awesome stuff have you contributed to a game that came from outside the dice mechanics?  How did it later interface with the mechanics?  How did it affect the game as a whole?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70791/#Comment_70791" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T10:34:25+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 10:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to provide all kinds of adversity.

This was a campaign where the old-school worked perfectly for various reasons.<br><br>Warhammer Fantasy Role-play. The GM has prepared a special adventure focused on my characters. He's got an idea in his mind of what the big puzzle is. He has the idea that my character is somehow fated to lift a particular curse pertaining to an inaccessible tower of the my monastery.<br>My character, a druid, has returned to his monastery to find everyone wiped out. He enters the inner chamber where he normally wouldn't be allowed to go and retrieves the monastery's hidden relic, which turns out to be a sheet of gossamer. I'm thinking "what the h#ll do I do with a gossamer?" So I say words to the effect of "OK, i walk out into the great hall and put the gossamer over my head. What do I see?" You could have knocked the GM over with a feather as my actions reveal the hidden stairway to the lost tower.<br><br>Later in the same campaign we're on our way to rededicate an ancient stone circle to act as a ward against evil. The properties of the circle are that evil cannot exist inside it. A hitch emerges - rededicate requires a human sacrifice! Meanwhile, the GM is tormenting us with his favorite villain, an incorporeal wizard demon who teleports in on us to mock and torment us whenever things aren't going well. <br>The GM goes to the bathroom. Whispering ensues.<br>The GM returns. We go to the altar at the center of the circle and start fiddling around aimlessly. Naturally our tormentor appears and we engage him in an argument. My companion (a squire seeking redemption) stands next to the altar and gives me the signal. I thrust the ceremonial knife into his heart, spilling his blood on the altar, thus banishing our tormentor who also happens to be the ancient evil we were sent to overcome. Al, the GM, was very torn between "Wow this is awesome" and "they killed my favorite NPC!"<br><br>Good times, good times.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70876/#Comment_70876" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T12:30:35+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 12:30PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            much like Jason, i like turning the screws of other players a bit.  <br>um ...in a recent Firelfy-esque game(yeah, who hasn't played a space western recently, huh?)my character, a Ship's Mechanic, then Reaver Survivor, made himself somewhat hard to get along with by questioning the Captain's "lifestyle choice".  i think i called his character a "dandy" to his face, and i told one member of the crew that i was "surprised he doesn't have matching pistols".  it's neat to play against perceived truths.  players expect charcters to be giving toward other players, and not really pushing.   no one expects a new player character to be a complete pain in the ass.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70907/#Comment_70907" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T14:37:58+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  2:37PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frank: awesome!

Also, because we "split the party", I was assigned to play half the Mossad hunter-killer team that captured Remi's guy after my guy abandoned him.
