With the right game, it's pretty easy. Sometimes, you'll find that some people become the players and others sit back and watch. That's fine.<br/><br/>Big foam dice are important.<br/><br/>I'd do a session on Yes Anding (or similar collaborative storytelling techniques), especially if you're then following it up with a game. And, whatever you're talking about, make it specific to the game you'll play afterwards. <br/><br/>(And thank you for the nice words about The Walking Eye.

You could have some real fun with this. Meg &amp; I ran an intro to rpgs at a local school library some years back, for teens. We talked about a bunch of games (brought copies for the kids to look at) and then she ran a brief demo of 1001 Nights. It was great.<br/><br/>Here are some more ideas.<br/><br/>For younger kids:<br/><b>Kings and Queens for a Day</b> - the creative power of role playing games\n<ul>\n<li>World Building: create maps and have kids put locations, monsters etc. on eachother's landscapes. Everyone goes home with a world to adventure in.</li>\n<li>Characters: create a couple three characters as a group from a kids-friendly game, like Storming the Wizards Tower, Faery's Tale or for younger kids, Big Night.<br/></li></ul>\nFor folks new to role play:<br/><b>The Art of Story</b> - social games that let you tell a story together\n<ul>\n<li>Opening discussion of favorite books, movies, tv shows. Video games with great stories? Incredible fun to enjoy these stories, why not create them with friends? Story telling (ghost stories at camp, telling stories for kids), use mechanics like board games or video game plus letting you make up what the characters do, create worlds together, have adventures.</li>\n<li>The People in your story (warm-up): example character creation from Breaking the Ice or Best Friends</li>\n<li>The World they live in: create a Primetime Adventures series,<br/></li><li>Play: sample scene from PtA, have two volunteers come up and play a scene, with suggestions from crowd. Facilitator frames the scene and makes sure to introduce an interesting complication! Give the audience fan mail (1 each) to use or not during a conflict. Wrap after roll.<br/></li><li>Wrap up - what was it like to play characters, what kinds of games (settings) would people want to play?</li>\n</ul>\nFor already gamers, interested in something new:<br/><b>Kicking it Up a Notch</b> - collaboration, hot conflicts and going new directions\n<ul>\n<li>Ready Made Powder Kegs: making situations ready to blow-- create a Dogs town together</li>\n<li>Cross-Pollinating Character: character creation from Spirit of the Century (feats, stunts and shared stories)</li>\n<li>Getting to the Good Stuff: adventure and combat that delivers without a grind -- sample of combat from 3:16, discovery phase and Rogue's phase from Swords without Master</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331065/#Comment_331065" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T17:15:12+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  5:15PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ross, I'd consider running this as a 15 minute workshop and 40 minute activity/discussion thing.
