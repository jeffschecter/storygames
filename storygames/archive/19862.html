It has been my favorite RPG for a while and at Gen Con this year, I heard about Fate Core from some of my friends who told me to check it out.  I bought it and consumed the rulebook.  I've been debating about trying to run a game using Fate Core but have a major concern about how the systems for advancement affect the play.<br/><br/>I really like Keys in TSoY as a way of allowing players to determine what sorts of things lead to character advancement.  Fate's advancement seems to be more authoritarian:  the Story Guide just kind of tells people when they've hit a "milestone" and then all of the characters advance.  <br/><br/>I'm wondering if anyone has enough experience with Fate Core to explain how this "feels" in play.<br/><br/>My concern is that the characters will be less driven because the players realize that they are rewarded for reaching the Story Guide's "milestones" rather than pursuing their characters' Keys and so they try to play into what they perceive will get them advances (even if it's counter to what the characters might do normally).                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440035/#Comment_440035" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-10T02:14:48+00:00" title="November 10, 2014  2:14AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, there's no Keys in Fate Core and there are lots of different types of Keys in TSOY, and advancement in Fate Core doesn't lead to Transcendence and removal from play as it does in TSOY so I'm really not sure how to answer your question.<br/><br/>Are you asking about:<br/><br/>How character traits are expressed?

Fate Core is EXTREMELY modular - in a way, you're asking me "how do supernatural abilities work in GURPS" and there's probably 10 answers, all valid and printed and supported and used by players of GURPS, and there's tons of GURPS games where there aren't supernatural abilities at all.<br/><br/>So let's assume you're organizing a Fate Core group and you want to do some kind of fantasy thing where you're pursuing individual goals for long periods.  <br/><br/><i>Steps on the way to those goals then become the milestones in the game that makes advancement happen.</i><br/><br/>Every session you get a minor milestone, every time you accomplish something significant in pursuit of your goal you get a significant milestone and if there's some catastrophic thing that happens that's a major milestone.<br/><br/>Now note that advancement in Fate Core is not a really significant part of gameplay, since characters start out fitted for the genre and situation they're in, and aren't merely aimed at greatness in a wider world by a XP curve as in TSOY or D&amp;D.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440039/#Comment_440039" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-10T02:37:28+00:00" title="November 10, 2014  2:37AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another way to look at it is that the milestones are milestones in the process of playing out what the game's about.

They don't actually advance the character.<br/><br/>Significant Milestones are your character becoming generally more adept at one thing or another as part of an ongoing situation, a broader change as a result of broader changed circumstances (though this may involve them not being so adept at something that's not as central to their ongoing, current problem.)<br/><br/>And of course at Major Milestones the whole campaign is changing to accommodate a straight-up powerup, a character who has been through the fires and come out on the other side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440081/#Comment_440081" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-11T20:00:31+00:00" title="November 11, 2014  8:00PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am liking the kind of thinking that is happening here.\n<blockquote>and if there's some catastrophic thing that happens that's a major milestone.</blockquote>\nWhat are you thinking of when you say "catastrophic"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440086/#Comment_440086" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-11T22:35:21+00:00" title="November 11, 2014 10:35PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, like Lex Luthor gets elected president or nanobots transform Metropolis into the City of the Future, or you decide to move back to Smallville to wreck the bankers who are bulldozing all the farms...some campaign- and character-changing moment.  <br/><br/>Essentially, every major milestone should be equivalent to a justification for a new campaign; it would be perfectly valid to start there with totally new characters of the new power level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
