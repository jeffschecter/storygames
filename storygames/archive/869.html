                    Crime Against Humanity<br/>
<br/>
This game is basically a war-crimes/human rights abuses trial with international prosecutors and judges. It is structured to allow each player to take multiple roles: to serve as prosecutor for one criminal charge, defense lawyer for another charge, and prosecution witness for a third charge. At the end of the game players are judges for some or all of the charges. <br/>
<br/>
We started by each choosing a nation that was taking part in the trial, writing down the relationship between our chosen country and Uruguay, and noting down a secret goal of our nation. Judson chose the United States with the goal of  returning nationalized property to rightful owners, especially US companies. Josh chose Iran with the goal or pinning blame on the CIA. I was Brazil, with a goal of getting back land lost during the 19th century Gaucho war. (By the way apologies for any giant historical errors, we werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trying to be accurate). <br/>
<br/>
Next we created prosecutors from our nations. We then created judges from one of the other playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nations, and gave them a personal motivation (we all ended up choosing similar motivations of fair trial, justice served, etc). We held a prosecutorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meeting to choose what charges we would bring, with charges drawn from a 1996 U.N. draft list if crimes against humanity. Judson chose to prosecute plunder of public &amp; private property; Josh brought an indictment on enslavement and forced labor; and I focused on the forced expulsion of residents of Brazilian ancestry. As a nice bonus, the tension between Iran and the US started flaring up in this meeting. <br/>
<br/>
Before each charge was heard the prosecutor and witness for that charge went out of the room for a brief consultation, then came back and the prosecutor launched right into opening statements, forcing the defense attorney to react. After opening statement, prosecutors and then defense attorneys questioned the witness for a few minutes, each followed by closing statements. We agreed that being on the defense was probably the most fun and most challenging role. For the enslavement charge, defense team Judson argued that the witness had broken a valid domestic law by criticizing the tyrant and therefore the force labor punishment was legitimate. For the expulsion charge, Josh showed that the 17 year old witness didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the facts of his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s land tenure and wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even an Uruguayan citizen. For the plunder charge I claimed that the alleged forgery of deeds was simple fraud rather than an international human rights abuse. <br/>
<br/>
After the cases were done we put on our Judges hat and wrote down our initial judgment on each charge, Then we met briefly with the prosecutor from our country, who lobbied us on how they though we should vote. (It turned out that all judges were leaning again the desired wishes of their governments.) Judges finalized and shared our verdicts (it takes a simple majority to convict) Innocent on enslavement, guilty on plunder and I forget how the expulsion charge went. As a final step we wrote down punishments (either a fixed term of 1-20 years, life, or death). Judson and I voted for life which prevailed over JoshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vote for 10 years. (A death sentence would have required unanimity).<br/>
<br/>
We had less suggested changes for this game, it went pretty smoothly and it was nice to rotate roles. <br/>
* allow objections. In the rules I allow objections as an option but it requires 4 players so one can be a judge ruling on the motion. We thought that in a 3 player game, the player being the witness could be neutral enough to adjudicate. <br/>
* real countries worked well- in the rules you have the choice of creating fictional nations but in this case choosing real nations gave us lots of stereotypes to work with<br/>
* Maybe have judgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ meeting at end to determine punishment rather than each player writing down recommended sentence?                </div>
