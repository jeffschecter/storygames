I think my major take away from the Creative Agenda concept is to extend "not everyone plays for the same reasons" to a very fundamental level, and to include that level in the effort to communicate how a given RPG ought to be played.  G vs N vs S/other/"just roleplaying, but functional" doesn't really matter as long as folks know and agree on how to enjoy your game.<br/><br/>In explaining my games-in-development to people before play, I've found Gamism to be a useful reference point.  "You can't lose, you may not feel challenged, there's minimal strategy.  Playing well is rewarding, but not in an 'I won the game' way."  Hopefully the rules themselves make that clarification unnecessary, but hey, I like to get people on board from the get-go.<br/><br/>Sim and Nar, on the other hand, have been completely useless to me in explaining "here's what we're doing".  If I say my game offers intrigue, immersion, and some ethical dilemmas, and here are their relative weights, then it doesn't matter whether our right to dream trumps our story now.<br/><br/>The way I look at it now, we all want dreams and we all want story.  It's just a question of what speed counts as "story <i>now</i>".  This isn't a hard line; it's a spectrum.<br/><br/>On one side, we have some qualities typical (not definitional!) of Narrativist play: conflict resolution, large-scale resolution, explicit stake-setting, short scenes oriented toward a goal, protagonists in separate scenes, spotlight on issues personal to characters, distributed GMing tasks and authorial powers, tough ethical choices, pathos, misery, relationship drama, one-shots and short games.<br/><br/>On the other side, we have some qualities typical (not definitional!) of Simulationist play: resolution of simple success/failure of immediate tasks, single GM with unique powers and responsibilities, hidden information, immersion, wandering free play, protagonists together in scenes, genre emulation, specific fictional references, long scenes, in-game planning and discussion, color for its own sake, campaigns.<br/><br/>Almost every game I've played over the past few years has been somewhere in between, with none of the above as a yes/no, either/or.  It's a spectrum.  N &lt;-&gt; S is a spectrum between Story Immediately and Story Maybe Never, which has a sizable sweet spot at Story Probably Soonish.<br/><br/>If my group is playing a two-shot game with lots of color, roleplayed dialogue, and big ethical issues -- some bold action and some cautious planning, some punchy scenes and some leisurely world exploration -- a GM who is the sole authority on the setting but constantly elicits player suggestions -- characters starting with situational premises that are personally compelling to the players and are meaningfully transformed through play, though without tidy conclusions for most -- <b>what do you call <i>that?</i></b>  I call it fun.

About what it looks like at my table, at least.<br/><br/>As far as I've seen, the amount of information needed to make a strong case for a CA in play is immense -- far more than I'm inclined to type here.  So, I can't prove my theory.  <br/><br/>All I can say is that, from my best analysis, the planning and world exploration and color and dialogue are absolutely <i>not</i> means to the end of addressing human issues in play.  <i>Not at all.</i>  They are methods for getting the fiction right, for achieving a certain desired character of aesthetic experience.  <br/><br/>As a CA, this is reinforced by round-the-table appreciation.  No one says, "Stop describing the damn room and roleplaying this NPC, Dave!  We've only got 4 hours and we're trying to resolve my guy's issues here!"  No.  Everyone digs my eerie wall paintings and the NPC's skeptic cadence and how they relate to the vision we're building of a Horror/Western movie in demon-infested Wyoming.<br/><br/>I mean, depending on where you draw the line for Nar/not, maybe this just sounds like slow-paced Nar to you.  It probably sounds boring and inefficient to other Nar-loving players with different taste.  For them, it'd fail the test of "priority" and seem like Story Eventually rather than Story Now.  Who's right?  How much priority is enough?<br/><br/>My take is that there is in fact no answer to that question.  The line doesn't exist.  <br/><br/>Prioritizing story, or prioritizing addressing human issues, isn't a matter of "either you do or you don't".  It's a matter of how <i>much</i> you do.<br/><br/>For a play group, it isn't that story/issue-addressing is either (a) <i>the</i> thing that lets the group play together in a mutually creatively satisfying way, or (b) irrelevant.  In my experience, it's more likely a <i>part</i> of what makes the creative endeavor work.  Sometimes a large part, sometimes a small part, and everywhere in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342248/#Comment_342248" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T12:30:47+00:00" title="September 11, 2011 12:30PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 12:31PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>If my group is playing a two-shot game with lots of color, roleplayed dialogue, and big ethical issues -- some bold action and some cautious planning, some punchy scenes and some leisurely world exploration -- a GM who is the sole authority on the setting but constantly elicits player suggestions -- characters starting with situational premises that are personally compelling to the players and are meaningfully transformed through play, though without tidy conclusions for most --<b>what do you call<i>that?</i></b></blockquote>\nSaturday.

I mean, for real? <br/><br/>I mean, I've read a few horror stories of people roped into games where the GM, thinking he was playing Narrativist, jumped the Players from one morality test to the next. But that's just sad and unfortunate and scratchy. It's storytelling as a freshman ethics class, right? <br/><br/>I mean, no one with any sense actually thinks this has anything to do with Narrativism, right?<br/><br/>Narravism is about Story Now. Story is all about characterization and details and color, which provide the context in fictional form for the human issues to matter... like, you know, <i>stories</i>. The way any story worth its salt, whether it be <i>Le Morte D'Arthur</i> or <i>Aliens</i> or the Sagas of Iceland has, as its priority, an exploration of human issues. <br/><br/>I mean, right?<br/><br/>I'm starting a <i>Hero Wars</i> campaign Tuesday night. It will be Narrativist play. And it will utilize almost everything from <i>both</i> your lists. (Except for a focus on "misery"... where the hell did this focus on <i>misery</i> come from?) And all those elements will be there to create the <i>context</i>. This way the human, thematic issues of how to live to have value. <br/><br/>It will be a campaign. There will be a GM. There will be GM secrets. There is a detailed setting I've been pouring over and can't wait to share with my players. And so on... <br/><br/>I'm not sure where or how or why you're drawing you lines. But to me, you're hard baking certain techniques into Creative Agendas which are not inherently baked into those Agendas.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you're wrong about how you're seeing things. I'm just saying I don't see how you're seeing Narrativism and Simulationist play at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342257/#Comment_342257" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T13:16:14+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  1:16PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forcing something as complex and dynamic, as dirty and wondrous as the interplay of creative and social goals of the folks involved in playing an RPG into a simplistic 4 box taxonomy (G, N, S, and dysfunctional) is doing violence against understanding and actually communicating what we want and can provide to others during play. <br/><br/>To my mind the only legitimate use of G, N, and S is to provide possible archetypes for functional, creative play. But as such they are hardly exhaustive. As points on the map rather than boxes they serve to suggest new territory and open vistas, not lock things away and encourage inaccurate generalizations. And there is plenty more ways to play beyond just G, N, and S. <br/><br/>What I find far more interesting is how we can form creative agreements and communal understandings of what we want and how we will all work to provide it before and during play. You don't want to just reiterate that you keep rolling the dice until you magically find a group that works for you. Learning and communicating what other players want and can give and what you want and can give, is a rich and complex process. It says more about how you play than some largely arbitrary box.<br/><br/>So, in that vein, David, why don't you tell us how your group comes to creative and social agreements, how you communicate with each other what you want from play, and what you get out of play after a good session?<br/><br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342258/#Comment_342258" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T13:17:24+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  1:17PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 1:18PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>You are wrong!

One of the biggest challenges the Big Model still has, I think, is reconciling the fact that elements of story (for lack of a better term), elements of fidelity to an aesthetic, and elements of challenge exist in pretty much all rolegame play ever, period dot, with the sense of priority that creative agenda is intended to convey.<br/><br/>I've only ever tried to draw those lines in the immediate context of the group I'm playing with. There are no concrete measuring tools, and we don't tend to examine our play that consciously. <br/><br/>Instead, we mention the army's coming, and then notice (usually after the fact) that we <i>didn't</i> run a bunch of scenes where we prepped the town's defenses and tried to figure out how best to take advantage of our position relative to our foe, or a bunch of scenes where we laid out precisely how much time we had based on what terrain they were crossing and how much our militia could "realistically" set up by then.  <br/><br/>Instead, we ran the scenes where the soldier says goodbye to both his mistress and wife, where the priest finally decides that there's something worth taking up arms for, where the thief grapples with the temptation to run away even though it would mean abandoning his compatriots. <br/><br/>Most of the time, I eventually get a clear sense of overall priority for that group, where I can call some elements "part of the creative endeavor" and others "the reason we're here".<br/><br/>Do I need to do that to have a fun game?

Sim (character centred Sim, at least) would have players thinking mostly along the lines of 'what would my character do' and focusing on 'feeling the character'. It's all about 'feeling like you're really there'. Nar, on the other hand, is like being part of a writer's team and having control of one of the main characters. Sure, you're trying to feel your character and think what he would do, but only as means for creating a better story (since stories with incoherent characters aren't good stories). Your main goal, as player, isn't to 'feel like you're really there', but rather to create a cool story with this character being one of its main characters. This doesn't mean you don't want good descriptions, atmosphere etc, since those are necessary for a good story as well. But the driving idea is different.<br/><br/>That said, there are problems with the GNS. My main problem with it is that S is really 'whatever didn't fit into G and N' for the most part. It becomes quite evident when you actually try to design something with it. If you say 'my game is Gam', then you know you need to focus on the elements that make challenges and what players will do in those challenges, what they're going to risk, what they're going to gain etc. If you say 'my game is Nar', you know you need to look at the story decisions to be made, the sort of questions the story will ask, the sort of answers that can be given, directions in which you can take the story etc. You say 'my game is Sim' - and you're stuck. It doesn't really get you anywhere, design-wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342262/#Comment_342262" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T13:39:11+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  1:39PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, you don't see a difference in "get to the point" attitude as typical of Nar vs not-Nar play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342263/#Comment_342263" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T13:41:13+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  1:41PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just played Apocalypse World yesterday, and character creation establishes what's important, right up front: <br/>- PCs have unstable or complex connections to one another, up front. This establishes emotional dynamics and room for feelings of emotional "resonance" in play. <br/>- Rules about gear, weapons, armor/damage, etc. are quite simple, de-emphasizing the importance of getting those details exactly right or them occupying much space in play, by default.<br/><br/>Beyond character creation: <br/>- the MC's task is to keep the game centered around the theme of fundamental scarcity - - not exploring the logistics of the problem (tracking harvest yields, f'rex), but rather using NPCs as mouthpieces for the problem. Example: affliction-type threats use MC Moves that rope in NPCs, so that we are always talking about how scarcity affects, harms, and alters real people with feelings<br/>- NPCs are both disposable and emotional creatures. They serve as "faces" for the problems of scarcity, by showing what the stakes are for dealing with those problems (will my hardhold make it through the winter without Boo's help? will supporting this cult lead to the end of Dremmer's reign as King of the Flats? etc.). Basic Moves are designed to force ugly, painful choices on the characters - - failure is a nasty option. <br/><br/>Overall, by saying "let's focus on <i>this</i>, and not <i>that</i>", we get a game's priorities in terms of GNS. In this particular case, Dave, I kind of agree with your spectrum, <b>N &lt; - &gt; S</b>, but I think the variable is<i> "Players AND GM can mechanically prioritize Story Now"</i> vs. <i>"GM ONLY can mechanically prioritize Story Now"</i>. If we look to GM prep and input as the sole source of "the plot", we are in a strong position to seriously do some S-play. If we look to the players for the bulk of "the plot", we're in a strong position for some serious N-play. But I agree that it all comes down to what you spend your time on. If an in-game assassination inspires us to debate ballistics for ten minutes, that expresses some very different priorities than if we debate the social and political implications of it instead. <br/>It's very important not to counter-pose these two foci as incompatible, but again, it's hard to do a lot of one and have much time for the other. They're zero-sum and can coexist, rather than being all-one or all-t'other. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Chris">@Chris</a>: I was playing <i>Hot Guys Making Out</i> the other night, and when a story-games-newbie dove into a very lengthy description of the guest bedroom, one of the other players interrupted him and said, "Use impressions, not schematics.

I don't mean that dismissively. I mean it as, "I've thought about this, and I don't think this is the case."<br/><br/>Again, in my games, when I'm GMing, I'm <i>always slowing things down</i> and getting the Players to really add more details and context, and I make sure to do the same myself.<br/><br/>I think the distinction that matters is what Michael wrote: "I think what makes Nar what it is is not rushing things towards story, it's the way a player views his character and what he focuses on when making his decisions."<br/><br/>I'd add that the distinction is also on what the Game Master focuses on to feed the Players.<br/><br/>A Narrativist-play Game Master is going to be feeding the low rumble of this: "You're Character will be revealed by the choices he makes." But the point isn't to get to those choices as quickly as you can. Again, that, to me, is a series of exercises from a freshman college ethics class. Not story.<br/><br/>I'm saying if you look at <i>Aliens</i> or the Icelandic sagas they are full of details and color and characterization. But the reason they stick is because they are, whether the audience is aware of this or not, about human choices. You have to get there eventually, but you don't want to obliterate the story details... or you don't have a <i>story</i>.<br/><br/>A Simulationist-play Game Master doesn't need to feed these choices--though certainly choices can be part of play. Instead, in my view, the focus is on giving the Players fictional elements to <i>experience</i> through their Characters. Choices matter to the degree that they feed the "feel of the world" -- if they show up at all. But mostly its about the enjoyment of "being there" or getting the details "right."<br/><br/>Now, can one work economically? Yes. But that's craft in either Agenda. But certainly, in my view, rushing to the point of the decision making is not what defines Narrative play. <br/><br/>The metaphor for me has always been this: Narrativist play is like Epic poetry (deeds, decisions); and Simulationist play is like Lyrical poetry (the experience, the rightness of it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342267/#Comment_342267" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T13:57:10+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  1:57PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Chris">@Chris</a>: I was playing<i>Hot Guys Making Out</i>the other night, and when a story-games-newbie dove into a very lengthy description of the guest bedroom, one of the other players interrupted him and said, "Use impressions, not schematics.

But that's about economy and focus, in my view. At some point, if we know what the focus is, we want more of that. If the description was focused on how it makes the character feel and why they value the room, would we be cutting him off? Is duration the issue, or focus? <br/><br/>By the same token, years ago I was involved in a game where the GM and I were building this terrific story for my character about his moral dilemmas. A fellow player, during a dinner break, made it clear she had no love for this at all.

You only have so many hours with your buddies and so many words to speak and hear in that time.<br/><br/>Absolutely.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to make clear--about my point of view at least--is that this isn't a matter of <i>rushing</i>, which is sad, but choosing what to focus on when speaking. My point is that fictional details, in and of themselves, are not counter-productive to Narrativist play. That they are, in fact, required. But which details? That's the rub.<br/><br/>I often point to Dramatic Narrative (the craft of plays or movies or television) being a lovely touchstone for learning Narrative play, because Dramatic Narrative is the revelation of Character through decisions and actions (which also includes what someone says). We might have a shot of the landscape, but not for long, because the focus of this material is the actor portraying the Characters <i>doing</i> things. So, the camera spends most of the time focused on the actors. (And in a play, if there are no actors onstage nothing is happening.)<br/><br/>As a counter-example, looking at Tolkien's loving description of landscapes. That has nothing to do with revealing Character. We might go two pages (or more) hearing about what the land looks like, what happened on the land, and then a digression into a king who once lived a long time ago. We've left the Characters behind completely. But what it <i>does</i> do is put the reader in that environment. It let's us experience the world with the same awe or wonder as the Hobbits seeing for the first time -- but it is, absolutely, about the experience of <i>being there</i>.<br/><br/>It's not that what the storyteller is focusing on is good or bad. It's not about rushing. My only point is that as long as we're focusing on the things that this thing is supposed to be, people probably won't get impatient.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342272/#Comment_342272" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T14:13:28+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  2:13PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ODDin, I'm with ya, man.

I've experienced it across G, N, and S play.<br/><br/>In G play, I've experienced it as polite tolerance as the GM gives color details no one really cares about, and then a lot of followup questions about "is there a trap" and "what looks valuable" and "can I roll initiative now" and even "okay, so does the next room have a monster?"<br/><br/>In S play, I've experienced it a lot like Zac has, with polite tolerance as people slog through emotional issues or long fight sequences, and then a lot of followup questions about discovering things in the game world. <br/><br/>In N play, I've experienced it as people asking for a gag order on the color details and returning the conversation to what matters to the characters. (Specifically, as an example, where one scene drifted into a 20-minute discussion about how a fantasy country's legal system worked, and someone said, "Okay, so the important thing here is that we want to find a loophole to free them, because we don't want to let down our friends. Can we just roll and see if that happens, and then justify it after the fact?") <br/><br/>So, yeah. It's a thing. <br/><br/>I think Zac and David pretty much nailed it on the head - issues, challenge, and fidelity/discovery/Sim/whatever aren't mutually exclusive priorities. They add up to a whole.

Of course there are an infinite number of ways to get to addressing human issues via roleplay.  I was just hoping that my point about the CA spectrum could be illustrated by our shared associations with certain techniques.  Like, <i>why</i> do we <i>usually</i> employ these techniques?  Could we paste "conflict resolution for more consequential drama" next to "wandering free play to celebrate aesthetics" into the same activity and expect folks to do both?  By golly, we can!  Do we need to know which is more important and declare a winner?  By golly, there is <i>no point</i> to trying!<br/><br/>I used to think that N/S-classifying a game project would give me an understanding and tools that would be invaluable in making good games.  Every good RPG I've played since seems to argue against that.  Techniques matter more.<br/><br/>I used to think that N/S-classifying a game-to-be-played-right-now would help me better coordinate my groups.  Every good session I've played since seems to argue against that.  What we want out of the activity doesn't need a unitary identity, and in fact avoids one.  Just like every other complicated game out there.  If you're trying to get someone on board for your slow, immersive, creepy Narrativist game about overcoming mental trauma, "Narrativist" is probably the one part of that equation you <i>don't</i> need to bother telling your players.

But I don't know. I'd be curious to know what game or person taught suggested to you what Narrativism is. (Me?

My usual go-to game group is far more interested in S-play than I am, so even though we share an interest in N-play there are times when I will bow out before the game starts up because they've "gone where I can't follow" (or at least, don't care to). A HUUUGE element of GNS, imo, is figuring out which players you should be gathering unto yourself, what games you should play together, and how flexible you are, personally, with changes to either of these factors. <br/>Secondly, I'll just add right quick that <i>Polaris</i> taught me Narrativism. That's very likely why I prize emotional "resonance" (affect, basically) as a hallmark of such play, and why I generally cleave to N-play (because resonance is a huge play priority of mine, it's hard to find games that I like if they don't provide that). <br/>I had a neat talk about AW playbooks yesterday, in this context: the players wanted to know if they should think about balancing the "party", how critical it would be to have an Angel on hand as a "healer", etc., and I told them, "The point of this game is to explore life under conditions of extreme scarcity, and the kind of drama and situations that provides. Choose your playbook, and your individual character details, based on what you would like to see in the game; <i>don't</i> choose them on the basis of what you think you might need, or are afraid of leaving behind." That's more of an N/G distinction, maybe, than an N/S distinction, but I'm happy to debate the point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342281/#Comment_342281" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T15:05:55+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  3:05PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Should we start a new thread about whether Story Now tends to mean rushing?

I restated that largely because I thought I failed to state it in my first post. I think, actually, that there's not a whole lot of disagreement in this thread at all. I'm treating it as a "talking about experiences" kind of thing. I read a lot into David saying "(not definitional!)" about the techniques he related to N or S play. So we're with you too, right, the use of a particular technique doesn't predicate a particular agenda.<br/><br/>If there's a conclusion to be reached for me, I think, it's that there's a lot of subjectivity in the test of priority when you're trying to define a creative agenda among different groups. If your group spends a lot of time on getting immersive details right <i>as a means to</i> heighten the satisfaction of the emotional/thematic payoffs, it can be hard to see that the end-state is actually a Nar priority, unless you're sitting at that table. Hell, sometimes it's hard even if you're sitting at that table. And as long as no one is bored or dissatisfied, like David said, maybe it doesn't matter that we know the difference. <br/><br/>To use a superficial simile, it's sort of like the word "campaign". We can (probably) all agree that it means "not a one-shot or one scenario". Beyond that, you have folks who read "a year or two" into that word. You have folks who read "6 to 8 weeks" into that word. And so on. We just had a thread about it, IIRC.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean the word "campaign" is useless, only that it's where a conversation begins, rather than where one ends. There's still more to talk about, after you use that word. These days, creative agenda works the same way for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342283/#Comment_342283" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T15:12:30+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  3:12PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 3:12PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>"The point of this game is to explore life under conditions of extreme scarcity, and the kind of drama and situations that provides.

And this has meant, on occasion, when people hear about the prioritization of issues that matter to the Players, the game is supposed to focus on that and that everything else is sort of an impediment to that.<br/><br/>But, for me, I've only seen it once in person: A game of <i>In A Wicked Age</i> at a con. None of us had played before. We were really intrigued with and focused on the conflict resolution system. We just rushed from one conflict to another. It was like story as WWE. But, you know, you're just supposed to play the game with lots of talking and world building and creating color -- and <i>then</i>, if a conflict occurs, you bring in the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342289/#Comment_342289" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T15:37:46+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  3:37PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 3:48PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agh!

This made me think about what really does firmly separate S-play from N-play: the players' centrality in creating the plot. Ordinarily, I'd say "driving the plot", but if the GM provides the transportation and plans the trip, the players getting behind the wheel doesn't do much to give them top-level control of what's going on.<br/>In Nar play, you have scale it out farther: the GM could suggest which city to start driving from, help everybody pack, etc., but the trip planning (and of course the driving, too) are going to have to be done by the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342297/#Comment_342297" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T16:04:53+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  4:04PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, with Zac and back to the original topic:<br/><br/>No one has ever said Right to Dream and Story Now are completely fire-walled.

At the same time, what do we mean by "meaningful"? I'm not trying to Clintonize or anything ("what is the definition of 'is'?"), but, for myself, I consider a game like Microscope to lack meaningful player-decision-making in that I cannot play it and have any sort of structure provided in the mechanics such that I can explore an ethical or emotional theme through play. IMO, the emphasis on events over characters robs me of any sort of starting point to begin exploring theme - - I'm accustomed to person-centered themes and using the person-POV to explore them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342305/#Comment_342305" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T17:02:51+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  5:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 5:10PM by stefoid.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the discussion was about the value of GNS classification?<br/><br/>Anyway, I can tell you what I mean by 'meaningful'.  Players want to have a significant effect on play - they want it to matter to themselves and the other players that they are actually there, participating.  Its like the difference between playing a slot machine or playing one of those machines where you play a hand of virtual cards.  Both are gambling 'games'.  Both require that a human being be present to operate the machine.  But for the slot machine, the player makes no meaningful choices, whereas for the card-playing game, the player does make meaningful chocies - what cards to hold, fold, how much to bet, etc... <br/><br/>In many games that I have not enjoyed, for various reasons I felt like I was just there to 'pull the handle' when it was my turn.<br/><br/>I havent played microscope.  But for it to be an enjoyable game, it must have some meaningful chocies made by players.  Apparently those choices dont involve "exploring an ethical or emotional theme through play".  Ill take your word for that, but thats just one kind of choice.  There are others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342307/#Comment_342307" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T17:12:42+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  5:12PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 5:17PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>No one has ever said Right to Dream and Story Now are completely fire-walled.</blockquote><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=22017.msg225424#msg225424" rel="nofollow">Ron did</a>: "I think CA\u2019s identity (pending its presence) is a unitary thing: one of the three, period."

GNS is his baby, so I tried to learn it as he intended it.  Having done so, I've found it to be of less practical value than I'd hoped.<br/><br/>Hi David,<br/><br/>Let me clarify, because I misspoke.<br/><br/>I agree with Ron: Something is either Story Now or Right to Dream -- since a group is either on the same page of prioritizing that, or not.<br/><br/>In the context of the thread you linked to, you were discussing Hybrids of the two at the same game. Like Ron, I don't thin that works. (I think a group can take turns passing around the priority to different people with different priorities, but that's not a hybrid, that's taking turns.)<br/><br/>What I should have written is that the <i>techniques</i> -- for example, those you listed in the first post -- are not fire-walled off. The notion that description of world or characters is somehow one Creative Agenda or the other is, to me, weird. The notion of strong GM or GM-less belonging to one or the other is weird to me. <br/><br/>The techniques, for me, that you listed as under Story Now or Right to Dream can serve either agenda successfully. What matters is how they are used -- specifically as Michael pointed out when he wrote, "I think what makes Nar what it is is not rushing things towards story, it's the way a player views his character and what he focuses on when making his decisions." And I also think the GM is in there, too, in terms of what he focuses on offering the players.<br/><br/>Notice the word "Decisions" in the quote from Michael. Steve says what Players want are meaningful decisions. I would say, "What's meaningful to one player might not be meaningful to another." And that the nub of the matter. <br/><br/>If we're all on the same page with our CA -- that is, if the decisions that are prioritized are the decisions we think matter -- whether I'm making the decision or Bill across the table is making the decision, I'm paying attention, because I think the decision is meaningful. But the moment people go off into decision making that doesn't matter to me (and setting up decisions that don't matter to me) then I check out.<br/><br/>This has nothing to do with whether there is a GM or whether or not the conflicts are large scale or small. This is what the <i>priority</i> of the Creative Agenda is.<br/><br/>So, again, Ron, in replying specifically to your notion of Hybrids is saying, "Nope. The Agenda is either one thing or another." And I agree. And now I'm saying the two lists of techniques you've written above seem to have, in my experience, little bearing on how one accomplishes those agendas successfully or not. Lots of world detail or not doesn't affect the priority. It affects how you get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342317/#Comment_342317" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T17:57:17+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  5:57PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 6:01PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/>I'm saying, with the driving analogy, that there are commonalities between S &amp; G and G &amp; N, but N &amp; S have a fundamental clash going on.<br/>S &amp; G: pre-planned tableaux could be employed. Pre-planned plot (right down to the dialogue and stage direction) is also possible. In G, the meaningful decisions must arise in tactics, planning, and resource management; there must be a way to win, and legitimately do it without fudging or mercy from the GM. <br/><br/>G &amp; N: again, meaningful decisions must be handed to the players, so that (a given value of) Meaningful Outcome is achieved. G= can we win? If we do, will we have earned it? N= can I resolve a theme? If I do, did the GM hold my hand and lead me there, or did I (was I able to) make it happen by my choices being respected? Both G &amp; N can benefit from conflict resolution - that is, really settling the heart of the matter. G can also employ task rez, so long as it doesn't interfere with the player's ability to point his bat at the stands, Babe Ruth style, and then try his best to accomplish that thing. <br/><br/>N &amp; S: too much GM-directed plot robs the players of meaningful choice (bad for N), like when you tell the GM you spare the orc's life and the GM has the orc attack you later, for no reason (BECAUSE the GM crushed your attempt to establish characterization, or to demonstrate the alternatives to killing, or whatever). <br/>Or maybe setting detail, world-building/exploration, and How-Does-It-Work are all relegated to supporting the exploration of theme instead of being ends in themselves (bad for S), like when you lovingly describe every detail of your vampire-PC's lair, and the other players are way more interested in exploring the tension of you and your ex-lover contemplating an alliance to save the city (BECAUSE you don't want to make dynamic, painful decisions that disrupt this world you've carefully built!)<br/><br/>Does that help at all?

All functional roleplaying is that.<br/><br/>"Are you playing to address premise?"  Well, how much caring about packing how much premise-addressing into how much play time counts?  Addressing human issues is a valued ingredient of my play.  It's often not <i>the</i> reason to play.  When is it <i>the</i> reason and when is it not?  I dunno.  Is there any reason in the world for me to care about answering that?<br/><br/>Edit: colorful rantings deleted so as not to obscure the point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342323/#Comment_342323" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T19:50:52+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  7:50PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 7:51PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>I consider a game like Microscope to lack meaningful player-decision-making in that I cannot play it and have any sort of structure provided in the mechanics such that I can explore an ethical or emotional theme through play.

It's a spectrum of player control.<br/><br/>Imagine you're in a dungeon crawl, and the party comes across a lone goblin, chained to the floor. There are manacles and keys nearby; through investigation the players can determine that they can free the goblin altogether, switch out the chain for the manacles, or just leave him there to rot. Or kill him, if they're feeling sadistic. This is a situation with a moral dimension. Even if there are no apparent consequences, the act of killing a defenseless person is morally relevant on its own terms. <br/><br/>Sim = the GM will ultimately choose a particular outcome, and the players are interested in what the GM says will happen. I've met plenty of people who join a dungeon crawl so they can see the cool story the GM has put together. The dungeon itself, fighting and so forth, is already fun, and a neat backstory or plot to discover is that much more compelling. <br/><br/>Nar = the players' actions determine the outcome. The GM injects new elements (the goblin claims to know of a hidden treasure, the goblin claims he can grant wishes, he leads them away from etc.) to further complicate the decision, but leaves the actual outcome up to the players. Addressing Premise requires player choice. Having theme in the story is not the point, whatsoever. The point is that the players are the ones making theme happen, and it can be about whatever they want. Even games with strong themes like MLWM or Polaris are still, ultimately, going to explore different, <i>specific</i> territory every time. <br/><br/>Now, if the GM tricks the players into an outcome, bribes them into it, makes it happen in spite of their actions to the contrary... that's just dysfunctional.<br/>But if the GM leaves it up to the players to ultimately decide the outcome of the morally charged situation, no amount of describing the scenery can dislodge the Nar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342325/#Comment_342325" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T19:57:34+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  7:57PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 8:13PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac,<br/><br/>I think that's a perfect example of techniques that <i>tend to go with</i> certain CAs for good reason but are <i>not</i> intrinsically tied to them.

It's a more hands-off style of GMing, and I really dig it. <br/>Lastly, themes only count for Nar if the players make them. That's the point of Nar play, for me, and it's been my experience that that's what the theory states.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342338/#Comment_342338" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T21:21:21+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  9:21PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The phrase that's been missing from this thread so far is "reward cycle."  Dave, you're focusing too much on moment-by-moment decisions and not enough on broader considerations.  The term reward cycle doesn't necessarily refer to mechanical improvement of the PCs, though it can; it's about the framework we use (consciously or not) to organize play.<br/><br/>I *am* a believer in secondary creative Agendas\u2014I've seen functional N-S play, and even S-N play (more rarely, though our Sign in Stranger game is an excellent candidate).  But there is always *a* primary reason why the group gets together to play, and why people keep coming back in the case of a longer-form game.  If it seems like there are two\u2014"I <i>must have</i> both crunchy challenges and moments of intense interpersonal angst!" that's because one of them is the means to the actual end.<br/><br/>SiS is so compelling because it gives us tools for experiencing the alien world through our characters.  So it felt, at times, kinda Narr-y.  But the real point of the game, for our group, was exploring the setting.  It's just that doing so would have been boring if we didn't care about our characters.  (SiS might be a game that pulls a switcheroo if you play for a loooong time; I do believe campaigns can change CA part-way through.  Look at the whole Adventurer-Conqueror-King idea, or, for something that's already done, 3:16.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342342/#Comment_342342" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T21:37:02+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  9:37PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 9:37PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>I'm not sure if identifying a reward cycle is much easier or much different from just saying, "Here's why I think we keep playing."  Especially in RPGs whose primary reward cycles don't correspond to any mechanics.  I mean, if you look at Apples to Apples, there's a winner, so it's Gamist, right?  But if you look at why a given group might wanna play twice it has nothing to do with winning or losing.  <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm using momentary decisions to try to showcase player attitudes.  I know, it's not very scientific, but I look at the returns on my thousand-word Forge post of yore and I just don't wanna go there again.<br/><br/>I do think my original point has been somewhat maimed by this point, and I am one of the maimers.  Back in a sec to try to clarify...<br/><br/>P.S. FWIW, I didn't see any Nar in our SiS game, though I totally hear you about the long-term switch potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

The mechanics are character-focused, with an eye toward character change and arcs.  I was invited to this game largely because I get into character-acting.  The game was pitched as "fiction-first" meaning more time and attention is spent on narration than on anything else (like system-strategy).  Color was huge.  Atmosphere was huge.  Music, sense of place, detailed description.  Every PC was shown off initially, established as a watchable hero or villain.  The GM had no specific plot in mind, but did intend for us to produce a movie of the genre we'd chosen.  He presented my character with various opportunities.  I took some to show off my concept, I took others to drive events and drama, and I took others to make some tough choices of known and unknown consequences.  Each session ended a movie, with some characters changed, some dead, and some simply having witnessed a compelling drama.<br/><br/>What was our top priority?  There is no single answer.  At the social level, hanging out and having fun and playing the game the best we could.  At the technical level, narrating rather than otherwise.  At the creative agenda level... uh... making a cool movie?  That was aesthetically rich and satisfying and clever and personally resonant?<br/><br/>Not addressing any premises would have changed the game for the worse, but I think we still would have come back.<br/><br/>Always addressing premises would have changed the game for the worse, but I think we still would have come back.<br/><br/>I liked playing this way.  I might want to design something like it.  How does thinking, "Nar or not?" help me do either of these things?  I don't think it does.<br/><br/>As defined, each CA type has infinite possible versions.  The realization of the CA, the style in which it manifests, depends on the techniques employed.  Character-POV Gamism can employ identical techniques to strategy-heavy Simulationism... yet if you put those two groups together, they will bore the fuck out of each other.  Theme-heavy Simulationism can employ identical techniques to immersionist Narritivism... and if you put those two groups together it's a seamless blend and you can't tell who's who.  Telling a good story in terms of <b>developing theme</b> and telling a good story in terms of <b>reproducing themes</b> are often the same thing.  Your Nar choices are never that pure and original; your Sim choices are never that pre-ordained and derivative.  The space required to <b>make statements</b> in Narrativism is identical to the space required to <b>stretch the shared input material</b> in Simulationism.  <br/><br/>When I had my Magneto character release his arch-nemesis upon acquiring weapons of world domination, it was simultaneously a cool spin on how supervillains work and a thematic statement of hollow achievement, and it was appreciated by the group equally on both levels.  And then that seemed like a satisfying place to end the movie, so we ended the session.<br/><br/>If I want to make that game, I need to think about aesthetic consonance and reinforcement, <i>and</i> I need to think about addressing issues, and if I let one dominate the other, I probably lose.  If I convince myself that one <i>should</i> dominate the other, I <i>definitely</i> lose.<br/><br/>Finally:<br/><br/>I have heard plenty of roleplayers talk about disliking Gamism or non-Gamism for reasons that make sense to me.<br/><br/>The vast majority of the time, when I hear a player who likes Sim saying how they dislike Nar, or a player who likes Nar saying how they dislike Sim, the <i>vast</i> majority, they're responding to their object of dislike being done <i>poorly</i> or to an <i>extreme</i>.  Hurried, preemptory Nar or aimless, debate-ridden Sim.<br/><br/>Yes, the poles exist.  But in the middle there's a melding, not a wall.  And I suspect there's a lot of good gaming in the overlap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342348/#Comment_342348" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T23:31:36+00:00" title="September 11, 2011 11:31PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2011 11:31PM by stefoid.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>I may be a partisan here, but to me the technique you're identifying is the very heart of my preferred mode of play!<br/><img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/><br/>It's like telling a hardcore Step On Up fan that competition is just an element of play, while for them it's the main point of playing the game.</blockquote>\nCan you say more about  this competition?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342352/#Comment_342352" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T00:12:22+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 12:12AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2011 8:03AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Nar games attract players who either suck at color or aren't interested in it or simply forget it amidst attention to system and/or addressing premise?

Address denotes action, in play you are making choices that reflect on the human condition.  It's an expectation that choices will come up in play and that we're open to exploring where the choices we make lead us.  This differs from the "right to dream" or "Sim" play because they start with a dream or a simulation that they are aiming to explore or play around in.  The dream tends to preclude making those choices as it would change the dream or if you think of it slightly differently those choices are made in character creation or in scenario creation and not in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example consider a Dogs in the Vineyard type scenario played functionally two different ways.  A western town with problems, a team of trouble shooters come in to "fix" the problems.  Played in a Story Now fashion the players come into town the problems are revealed and the players judge how to deal with them, deciding who they feel is in the right and who is in the wrong and what's to be done about it.  Both players and gm are expecting and willing to deal with the ramifications of the characters expressed beliefs and actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayed from a sim perspective we have a very good idea ahead of time how the characters are going to react to the situation.  The team of fixers will come to town and work to discover what is going on.  We're not looking to create situations that require moral judgement so it's probably going to be a little bit more clear cut how to deal with the situation but it may take more leg work to figure out exactly who has to be dealt with.   The group plays to see what steps it takes to resolve the situation not to question which steps should be taken to deal with it in a moral sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to whether it's a spectrum or not, I've never seen it in an in between state but that doesnt necessarily make it so.  It's so much about group dynamics and how the players interact with each other, the expectations of a gm on the players and vice versa, that I dont see how it could be a bit of both.  There can be a little bit of micro pieces of each going on in games but it's not really an all out an agenda.  When you get to the reward cycle level it gets harder and harder to see any overlap.  Take the DitV example again.  When you've resolved that situation and move on to the next if you are playing it nar the expectations of play are that the judgements in the new town will build and reflect the judgements made before.  In Sim play if a moment came up in play that could have been a moral judgement, looked like a possible address of premise, it's usually not a building block for later play merely an anecdote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342405/#Comment_342405" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T12:28:42+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 12:28PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Telling a good story in terms of<b>developing theme</b>and telling a good story in terms of<b>reproducing themes</b>are often the same thing.

In my experience, I have found a difference between the two in games I've played. <br><br>There's a sense of challenge involved in really addressing theme, a willingness to let the "answer" defy or stand in direct contradiction to the beliefs and convictions of the participants. I find that in Dogs play all the time (and these are just shorthanded examples, mind) - moral justice doesn't prevail, the bad guy doesn't get a comeuppance, there is no bad guy, situational ethics prevail, absolute moral authority doesn't always get abused, etc etc. The experience feels strange and messy, with a real sense of immediacy in how we took on the issues at hand. We all have an idea of what <i>should</i> have happened, what was <i>right</i> based on our experiences and biases. And it didn't occur, because the system doing its thing put us in unexpected places.<br><br>Reproducing theme tends to create a different experience - a sense of confirmation, of validation, of relief. We get fun neurochemical rewards when a pattern we're looking for falls into place. Some among Learned Folks (tm) consider this one of the primary benefits we get from experiencing any kind of fiction. I see this a lot in play also. Someone spins a web of lies, and we take it as a given that it's going to bite them in the ass, and then celebrate when we make it happen in a resonant way. Someone cheats on their spouse, and it ends up being a costly and horrific betrayal from which there is no recovery. (Or, depending on who is at the table and what they've been through, it isn't. Had a different outcome in different games, different instances.) Violent lives end violently. Etc etc.<br><br>Somewhere in the murk, though, I have to wonder if we can fool each other regarding which one is taking place - you continually enforce themes you believe to be right, but I'm just following the moment, so they seem like unexpected, immediate thematic answers to me. My gut says we'll eventually end up having tension with each other about it, but maybe not? Maybe neither of us will ever notice?<br/><br/>Hm.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342406/#Comment_342406" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T12:30:06+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 12:30PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that there are three things being related here to the Sim/Nar split: <br/><br/>1) Focus on sticking to a purely in-character view as opposed to an authorial view<br/>2) Ethical / moral decisions coming up in play<br/>3) Control by the players as opposed to control by the GM<br/><br/>I feel like all of these are really independent.

I've met plenty of people who join a dungeon crawl so they can see the cool story the GM has put together. The dungeon itself, fighting and so forth, is already fun, and a neat backstory or plot to discover is that much more compelling.</blockquote>\nOh hell no.<br/><br/>Sim play does NOT mean that the GM chooses the outcome of a scene and the players just watch. Hell no. That's not play at all. That's just storytime. Or dysfunctional play. It's not how good positive Sim play plays out at all. Functional Sim play still has meaninful choices that affect outcomes. In fact, it has lots of them.<br/><br/>I think a much better axis to dissect the "goblin on the floor" is to look at why it's there in the first place.<br/><br/>In Gamist play, the goblin is there primarily to address challenge. Perhaps the challenge is to successfully talk to the goblin and get something useful out of it (an alliance, information about a treasure, etc.). Perhaps the challange it to figure out that the goblin is a trap and that approaching it will cause the cage to fall and trap the part while the rest of the goblins shoot blowdarts at them. Something like that. It could be a rather subtle challenge that involves cultures or morals or whatever (and thereby starts to resemble things from Nar or Sim play) but it's still primarily a challenge, even if it has many different possible successful and unsuccessful possible outcomes which may or may not involve randomizers.<br/><br/>In Narrativist play, the goblin is primarily there to address premise. Perhaps there is some sort of slavery theme going on. Or something about vengeance vs mercy. That doesn't mean that the goblin couldn't be there as part of a trap, but if it is, the primary purpose of that trap is how that affects the characters and their feelings about goblins, etc - does the trap lead me to believe that all goblins are conniving opportunists, or do I view it as an understandably desperate response to the social situation of the goblins?<br/><br/>In Sim play, the goblin is there primarily to show the players about this part of the world. Maybe it's a chance to talk to a goblin because all the other ones encountered so far have been quick to attack. Maybe it's to show that there is an oppressed second class group of goblins that can be identified by the way they shave part of their heads. One major thing about the goblin being there in Sim play - the goblin would have been there regardless of the makeup of the party. It's there because it's part of the world, not because it's part of the interests and issues of specific characters (this isn't a 100% uncrossable line - Sim GMs certainly put some things in because of who in the party to interact with them. Like everything in my categorization, it's a generalization.)<br/><br/>I view the 3 groupings as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart" rel="nofollow">radar chart</a>. Radar charts are really a way of redrawing a bar chart, but I think they're a good way of showing that the outcome has more to do with emphasis rather than strict categorization.<br/><br/>There are lots and lots of decisions made during a gaming session (including those made in direct prep). Like hundreds. If you were to graph out the priority that was used in making those decisions, you'd get a radar graph. Whichever of the 3 priorities came up most often would be how you would determine the CA that was most important to the game (and yes, you could weight it however you felt was appropriate. And yes, you might get different results for the different individuals involved if you split them up that way.)<br/><br/>But the nice thing about a radar graph is that you can easily see that the other priorities are still there and are still important. And any 1 given decision made by a Nar group for a Nar game might be a decision that was primarily made for Sim or Gam reasons.<br/><br/>The overall game and the overall player preference is an amalgamation of more granular decisions.<br/><br/>Say, for example, that you're running a Sim focused game with lots of world exploration. And lets say that this world you're exploring is mostly peaceful most of the time, so you're using a system that doesn't have tactical combat resolution. But in this part of the world you're in, they have gladiatorial fights. So, as a group, you decide you want to play out some of those fights. So you pick or hack a tactical combat system to use. And you decide you want to choose one that feels very fair and has a challenge-driven feeling to it. And you play out those fights and revel in the tactics for a while. So for this part of the world, you're choosing to prioritize Gam values as you make your choices. But, ultimately, you're doing so because it fits in with your overall priority to explore and experience the fictional setting.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>The radar chart view of things makes it easy to see how that works out just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342411/#Comment_342411" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T12:50:56+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 12:50PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Anyway, I'm using momentary decisions to try to showcase player attitudes.</blockquote>\nYeah, I know, and *that's* your fundamental error, at least as far as using the terms the way Ron originally intended them.<br/><br/>Also, Apples to Apples isn't an RPG, and G/N/S theory *really* can't be used with any other media.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342414/#Comment_342414" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T13:33:12+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  1:33PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only problem with the radar chart is you are treating all decisions as equal when that's not the case.

But, to use your analogy, I would submit that all the little decisions along the way are absolutely NOT secondary to your choice of destination (and season, since you mentioned that too, and it fits with what you are saying).<br><br>When my friend Joe is going on a trip, he plans and plans and plans. He has an itinerary that is broken down into hour increments, or sometimes less. He knows before he leaves everything that he's going to do on the trip. He also works out the trip on a pretty tight budget. Because he has invested all that time in planning and comparison shopping, he is able to do lots of things for about 25% less cost than someone would get if they just showed up and found a vendor for water skiing or a luau or a bus tour or whatever.<br/><br/>That's his Travel Style (tm). He's a Planner. Because of his planning, he is able to fit in more activities. When he visits a place and then talks about it with someone later and they ask him "Oh, you went there? Did you see ___?" his answer is pretty much always yes, because he sees all the main stuff that people talk about.<br/><br/>When my wife and I travel, it's different. We plan out some major stuff, like where we are going to stay and when. But we purposely leave most of our time blocks unfilled. We may have a few specific things planned, like a certain museum or something. But a lot of what we do is we get to a place, we look around at what's there, and we pick something to do. We usually don't do very many things during each day of our trip. We spend a lot of time at the things we do. We relax and enjoy them and enjoy not feeling rushed to get to something else.<br/><br/>That's our Travel Style. We're Meanderers.<br/><br/>(Edit: Adding this part for clarity)<br/>And that Travel Style applies whether I'm going to the mountains in winter or to Hawaii in summer. Yes, I'll be making different choices based on the location. But the WAY I go about making those choices is based on my Travel Style. The fact that I leave the majority of my time open and unstructured until I arrive is how I travel, no matter where I go.<br/>(/edit)<br/><br/>I've travelled with a Planner before. There were parts of it that were fun. I saw stuff. But there were parts that weren't fun. Like feeling rushed. And not feeling like I was able to make any decisions based on what I was seeing around me and how I felt about it at the moment.<br/><br/>So I have a travel style. And that style is made up of the amalgamation of all the little decisions I make about a trip and the priority I typically put in place when making all those hundreds of little decisions.<br/><br/>And being a Meanderer doesn't mean that I don't make any plans at all. And being a Planner doesn't mean that Joe doesn't ever make a decision based on how he's feeling at the moment - for example some nights he may decide on dinner based on what he has heard is really good at that restaurant he's picked out, and other nights he might just be in the mood for a good steak.<br/><br/>But for each of us, the way we go about making decisions is driven more often by our preferred style than otherwise.\n<blockquote>GNS is specifically looking at those big decisions, moment to moment decisions arent of concern.

I think they are the only concern.<br/><br/>Creative Agenda is, in my understanding, about trends and tendancies. It's about what you tend to prioritize most often. It's about an amalgamation of individual choices.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342423/#Comment_342423" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T14:36:27+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  2:36PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>Don't worry, I'm aware that "showcasing" does not equal a super rigorous argument.

I find that in Dogs play all the time (and these are just shorthanded examples, mind) - moral justice doesn't prevail, the bad guy doesn't get a comeuppance, there is no bad guy, situational ethics prevail, absolute moral authority doesn't always get abused, etc etc. The experience feels strange and messy, with a real sense of immediacy in how we took on the issues at hand. We all have an idea of what <i>should</i> have happened, what was <i>right</i> based on our experiences and biases. And it didn't occur, because the system doing its thing put us in unexpected places.</blockquote>I think I disagree with your takeaway, but first I want to make sure I understand you.<br/><br/>Let's say in Dogs I expect to shoot the bad guy, I work toward making that happen, I get the opportunity, then I find out he's not really bad, but he kinda needs to go away for the sake of the town and OMG I just told everyone he was evil and needed to die and BLAM.<br/><br/>In one sense, that's unexpected and challenging.  That doesn't happen in most westerns.  The other players might have assumed I'd let him go.  We might all agree that letting him go was the right thing to do.<br/><br/>In another sense, it's totally expected and I made it happen because I wanted to.  We're playing fucking Dogs in the Vineyard; is everything going to wind up simple and happy and just?  Are my fellow players going to be stoked that I did the obvious thing and didn't kill the innocent "bad guy"?  Did we think our western was going to look like every western?  Did we want that?  Of course not.<br/><br/>I'm not talking about the character of the experience!  At the moment of the shooting we can all still be like, "Oh god no!!!"  But then you think about it afterward and, yeah, duh.<br/><br/>That's been my experience with Dogs.  And, sometimes, the players <i>can</i> be a little transparent about opting for morally difficult stuff just because.<br/><br/>Is that compatible with what you're thinking?<br/><br/>Anyway, I think if you start a Sim game and pitch it as, "A western, but dark and twisted, with intrigue and uncertainty about who's bad, and flawed characters who might become heroes or villains!" you get the exact same thing.  You kill the nice "bad guy" and in the moment it seems shocking and then after the fact we can go, "Of <i>course</i> you did that, we're doing an <i>edgy</i> western."\n<blockquote>Reproducing theme tends to create a different experience - a sense of confirmation, of validation, of relief.</blockquote>Agreed!  At <i>some</i> point.  I think there's a mix of tension and release in most good gaming, with plenty of decisions on both sides.  Maybe Sim tends to come back to the familiar more frequently, or at different times, than Nar?  I don't know.  There's plenty of relief in Dogs too, right?  There are some evil badguys and known tropes and completed missions...\n<blockquote>Somewhere in the murk, though, I have to wonder if we can fool each other regarding which one is taking place - you continually enforce themes you believe to be right, but I'm just following the moment, so they seem like unexpected, immediate thematic answers to me. My gut says we'll eventually end up having tension with each other about it, but maybe not? Maybe neither of us will ever notice?</blockquote>If we do it inelegantly we'll notice!  "You're so formulaic!"  "Well you try to turn every scene into a big moral issue!"  But if we are skillful about it, then no, I don't really see why we would ever notice...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342518/#Comment_342518" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T23:20:14+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 11:20PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2011 11:24PM by noclue.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Anyway, I think if you start a Sim game and pitch it as, "A western, but dark and twisted, with intrigue and uncertainty about who's bad, and flawed characters who might become heroes or villains!" you get the exact same thing.

In an edgy western, I could just decide that I'm going to join up with the bad guy and become his right hand man, and then were off on a different exploration of what life is like in a band of cut throats. And then I can leave his employ, go find me a wife or pan for gold. I don't have to address your uncertainty about who's bad in any meaningful way at all. I don't have to decide whether to shoot him.<br/><br/>In Dogs, we go to the Branch to fix it. We are presented with a dude who's arguably done wrong, but who is arguably forgivable.

I'll stick with your example, because it cleaves close to something I had happen in an actual game (except it was a hostage situation, and they learned why the guy was taking hostages, and the hostage-taker revealed other corruption in the town with his acts, and one of the Dogs gunned him down anyway). <br/><br/>So here's the thing: in the abashedly Nar play I've had with Dogs (and other games, not just Dogs), the Western thing (or fantasy thing, or superhero thing, etc.) is pretty much the least relevant notion at the table. Dogs isn't really a Western, anyway, as written. The setting has the trappings necessary in order to force the Dogs into a position where they must choose what to do with sinners and can't back away. That is all the significance those trappings have, a means to an end.<br/><br/>So, when you gun the guy down anyway after finding out he's not so bad, we're not asking any variant, in the moment, of "what kind of story are we telling here?" There is no set of preconceptions we owe fealty to. The conversation is about the human decision you made, now, why you made it, how it affects us, and what the consequences are. There's no distanced judgment. No right or wrong in the aesthetic sense. <br/><br/>Might we examine it in retrospect later, and make those judgments and conclusions at the pub? Sure, maybe. (Not in my experience - the pub conversation remains with the human actions and issues, without referring contextually to anything else. Because that's what we care about.) At the table, while the situation is live, none of that matters. And that's why it feels messy - there's no "Aha, I see what you did there" moment, because there's no rubric about what you're "supposed" to be doing. There's no pattern to fulfill.<br/><br/>Whereas with Sim play I've experienced, that sense of judgment and aesthetics is a known quantity, whether by explicit setting of expectations or emergent conversation in play (as in, it becomes obvious over time that we care). It matters, then, what kind of Western we're doing. Part of how we react to you shooting the guy in the moment is based on our perception of what kind of story this is supposed to be. And that doesn't have to be about genre alone, right - preconceived ideas of what's "right" or "wrong" in the game can cover a lot of different forms of ground. The distinguishing factor is how the presence of that sense of judgment changes the payoff. <br/><br/>So, you pitched me your edgy Western, and your guy shoots the not-so-bad guy. Getting the genre right matters to me, and I examine what you did, and I go, "Ah, of course. Keeping it edgy." That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy what you did, or that it wasn't emotional, or surprising, or whatever. It just means the payoff's different, for me. I go, "Aha! Pattern fulfilled." I didn't know what you were going to do, but I can accept it as within the boundaries of our shared ideal.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? I spoke imprecisely in my last post - all that stuff in the Nar play are examples of what happened, but I omitted what made them significant. It's that when they happened, the question of whether they should or shouldn't have, in any aesthetic sense, simply didn't matter to any of the participants. It was immediate, real, messy, and ugly, and the followup was always about responding to that messiness and that ugliness, rather than any sense of what was correct or not correct for that game. <br/><br/>And this too, in case it makes it more clear: In a situation where someone is transparently pushing toward difficult moral territory because they have a preconceived notion that this is where the game should go, and continually does it over time, and gets enjoyment out of finding the "right" way to do a Dogs in the Vineyard story, and that matters more than what's actually happening in the emergent interpersonal decisions... yeah, I'd pretty much consider that angling at Sim. Sim doesn't have to be about keeping your color consistent and detailed, or adhering to all the vagaries of a ruleset regardless of their outcome, and so on - it's any time that testing your game's content against a shared ideal matters more than anything else.  <br/><br/>And I experience these as wholly different kinds of sensation - they move my guts around differently. And yet, my question remains. Because it's very difficult to be sure of precisely what in a particular game is really shared among the participants. Maybe you think that you need to play the ideal Dogs story, and from your doing so, I get my squishy, messy, OMG human issues payoff. We talk about those issues, and maybe you take it as a sign that I share your ideal.<br/><br/>Personally, I've never noticed something like this in a game I've been in. But therein lies the rub - my perceptions are not infallible, of course. I could have been deluding myself a bunch of times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342535/#Comment_342535" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T03:00:32+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  3:00AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to say: Leonard, fantastic post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342541/#Comment_342541" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T07:42:45+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  7:42AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also want say, "Leonard, Awesome."<br/><br/>And to drill down for a moment, to get really specific, the "surprise" element in Story Now -- the "addressing premise" part, is the Player surprising himself or herself on a very moral/emotional/thematic level.

You're using his specific example as an exclusion, when he made a much broader statement before that. There are many kinds of patterns to fulfill. <br/><br/>There are genre patterns (I'd call them narrative patterns if I was talking about it in lit class, but that would be unhelpfully messy in this thread) where you do things because they are "supposed" to happen in stories like the one you're creating.<br/><br/>There are "it's like being in this part of history" patterns, where you do things because they parallel what you know about similar historical situations.<br/><br/>There are tropes patterns, where bad guys get their cumuppence and such. They don't relate to a specific genre, but they show up in lots of stories.<br/><br/>There's "realism" patterns, where you do things because they add to verisimilitude.<br/><br/>When you are making decisions about content based on matching to those different kinds of patterns, those decisions are using the Sim priority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342559/#Comment_342559" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T10:24:47+00:00" title="September 13, 2011 10:24AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>When you are making decisions about content based on matching to those different kinds of patterns, those decisions are using the Sim priority.</blockquote>\nThat's doesn't make sense to me.  <i>All</i> decisions in <i>all</i> games will follow some kind of pattern.

It's impossible not to make decisions based about matching some kind of pattern.  <br/><br/>However, that doesn't mean that the <i>point</i> of the game is simply checking off matching the pattern.  In my experience, Threefold Simulationist "what if" games are very much about interest in what is not predictable.

It is related to what is elsewhere called "Sandbox Play" - though definitions of that vary.  Threefold Sim is not at all the same as GNS Sim - but it is often seen to be a subset of GNS Sim.  i.e. If a game isn't concerned with story, then usually it isn't considered part of GNS Narrativism.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>If me and the other players are really interested in the "what if" open-ended possibilities for the characters and the world, then we don't have any payoff like "Aha!

At this point, Narrativism is "Story Now" as Ron Edwards described it.  If you think there is a serious problem with his definition, then I would agree with you.

I thought you were also doing that. I'd love to hear about your experiences in more detail, relative to the stuff being discussed. Being wrong is fun, especially on the Internet! Help me out.<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything wrong with Ron's definition of Narrativism. I've just never seen any discussion of it that's come to good ends as soon as the word "story" comes out. Because the kind of immediate, visceral address of premise Ron's talking about is a story only in retrospect, by his own definition. (See: transcript, if you want to play the Narrativism essay and Forge Glossary game. I really don't, though - God knows I did enough of it in my twenties.) In play, it's no such thing - it's a morass of motivated characters dealing with difficult things, however they deal with it. "Story Now" doesn't have anything to do with consciously attending the putting together of a three-act narrative in the moment. Yet, that baggage (and other baggage) around the word "story" remains and inhibits discussion. And I spend a lot of time sighing and shrugging. So turns the Internet.<br/><br/>Mendel: If you want to broaden out that far, then modifying, perceiving, and encountering surprising parts of patterns is one of the preeminent things that makes human life enjoyable. You'll get no argument from me that creative agenda is only a small part of a larger picture. This thread, far as I can tell, isn't about that larger picture.

I wonder whether that's a difference in what we've experienced, or a difference in how we choose to think about it afterward?<br/><br/>I'm at least as interested in understanding people as in understanding art.  I think I'm about as likely to see patterns in human behavior as I am to see patterns in music or fiction.  I'm also just as psyched about discussing each in the post-game.  Like: Cthulhoid fiction should be neither tidy nor completely obtuse, because the best stories do tell you <i>what</i> happens, they just don't pin down what that <i>means</i>.  Or like: you shot that guy because addressing peer pressure is actually more interesting to you than addressing justice, because of your kill-or-be-killed experience in high school.  <br/><br/>Maybe that difference is a big deal.  I'm not inclined to think it is, because the two tend to run together for me.  Sometimes I explain why I dig Cthulhu based on my real life; sometimes I explain why I care about peer pressure by referring to books and movies that provide good takes on it.<br/><br/>Anyway, all that was just background.<br/><br/>Here's what I mean about the experience of play:<br/><br/>I have never had a moment in a roleplaying game hit me with "Oh wow, I didn't know I/he/she would do that!" in a way that was more personally morally significant than it was aesthetically striking.  <br/><br/>My decision to help a novice sorcerer instead of completing my plan to sacrifice him for personal gain in <i>Sorcerer</i> felt exactly the same as my players' decision not to sacrifice the captive criminal to open the haunted castle in <i>Delve</i>.  They were both simultaneously thrilling on an aesthetic level and resonant on a real-life personal level.  I mean, that's part of what it takes to <i>be</i> aesthetically striking, right?  No one goes nuts over fiction they can't relate to.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm overly passionate about art and overly stoic about real life.  I dunno.<br/><br/>Deliverator Matt has often said to me that he likes his games to mean something to him personally, and the two of us play together just great!  I don't think it's a coincidence that we play well together and love a lot of the same ephemera (e.g. character-acting) across Nar and Sim alike.  Enjoying the same activities* seems more important than parsing them in the same way.<br/><br/>Re: "Story Now", I do think the name broadcasts "efficiently string together well-conceived plot points" more than "say something meaningful".  And I do think I've played a lot of purportedly Story Now games that were almost entirely the former and not at all the latter.  Whether that's inherent to those games or just a "playing with new tools" phenomenon, I don't know.  For what it's worth, I do <i>not</i> find <i>Sorcerer</i> and <i>Dogs</i> to fall into the "efficient plot points" category.  Maybe everyone else is just doing Narrativism wrong.<br/><br/>*Please don't take this as a claim that Nar and Sim are the same activity; I'm just making a general point about people doing stuff together.  It may or may not apply here; if you judge that it doesn't, I'm fine with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342610/#Comment_342610" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T13:24:58+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  1:24PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Leonard, your account (post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2374&amp;Mode=like">#74</a> above) makes perfect sense to me, logically, yet it doesn't ring true in my experience.

If we never reconcile it, I would almost be happier than if we did. <br/><br/>I think the difference is probably a mix of both. In play, certain elements stand out to me and I lock onto them. Afterward, I think about those elements and process them just like everyone else, according to my understanding of the hobby and what I like about it. I also notice when conversations about the game among my players (both during and after) focus on certain elements more than others, and take it as an indication of shared enjoyment.<br/><br/>And I've had that strong sense of Sim emphasis in those conversations, and I've had the sense of Nar emphasis too. Enough that I can articulate how I experience those phenomena separately. And I've had games where I couldn't tell, too! Right, like, I'm not suggesting there's perfect reliability here. It's experiential, anecdotal data, and is subject to the whims of confirmation bias and selective memory and all those other fun things the human brain does.<br/><br/>Here's the rub: creative agenda is, as Ron defined it, a <i>shared</i> experience. It's the priority among a <i>group</i>, in play, over time.<br/><br/>So the experience you're relating, as an individual? Yeah, totally makes sense to me. We're complicated beings. We can experience multiple kinds of pleasure at the same time. Me, I compartmentalize a little more - if I'm churning through relationship issues with another PC in a Star Wars game, I'm not very likely to think about whether or not this kind of content would ever be in Star Wars. (I know, aesthetics is more complicated than that; it's just an example.)<br/><br/>So then, the question hangs on, of those complicated thrills you get, which are shared and emphasized by your group? Which are actively given signs of support, and which are ignored? What piece of that thrill doesn't just belong to you? What's most important in the ongoing conversation?<br/><br/>(My guess is, you're still going to answer, "A mix." That's cool. I really don't have any urgency about pinning your group to one of the letters.)<br/><br/>It's like, I'm in an improv troupe, which consists of a mixed group of people who actively want to improve as improv comedians and people who mainly view it as a fun, theatrical social activity they can share with friends. In most of our practices, we play improv games, talk about what happened, talk about getting better at them, note when things go wrong, etc etc. The conversation, the shared emphasis, is on critique and improvement. That doesn't mean that individuals aren't getting their social time in. It just means that it doesn't take precedence in the shared space.<br/><br/>Creative agenda is nothing more than this, and carries all the baggage that any group human endeavor does. Sometimes, it's easy to tell what the shared agenda is. Sometimes, you have no damn clue, but you get on stage or on the field or whatever, and it all seems to magically work out. In those times, you wisely decide that as long as it's working, you probably don't want to examine it in too much more detail, lest you kill the vibe.<br/><br/>The question I've been continuing to ask is, "How can we really be sure that we're sharing the experiences we think we're sharing? Could it be you think you're sharing one thing, and I another, and we don't know?" Your answer so far is, "I don't think we often can, and yeah, if our modes of expression are subtle enough, probably we don't."<br/><br/>I'm okay with that answer. I don't know what else is going on in here, but as far as that segment of us talking things out, I pretty much was happy with concluding that there are things we don't know, and can't know, and that's all right.<br/><br/>(P.S. Seriously. The word "story" has crippled the conversation about Nar, and has for years. I kind of threw up my hands about it a long time ago, and am a bit surprised I even brought it up.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342611/#Comment_342611" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T13:31:28+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  1:31PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is, at the heart of it, our problem is that we're talking about things that are too big to be useful.<br/><br/>If you talk about politics and all you do is filter everything through a categorization into 3 political parties, then your discussion is going to be of extremely limited usefulness.<br/><br/>If you group people into Republicans, Democrats, and Independants and then assume that once you have people talking about things within their own group that they'll suddenly agree with each other about everything, then you're silly. <br/><br/>And it's even worse if you try to take the few meaningful things that you can describe about those three groups and their differences and then apply them directly to the 3 major party groupings in another country.<br/><br/>And we all know this. But we do it with RPGs anyway.<br/><br/>Big Model, Threefold Model, GNS. They're all way too high level. They fall apart once you start looking at practical details. <br/><br/>You have to keep drawing and redrawing the lines in different places. And the lines don't mean a whole lot anyway.<br/><br/>Looking at roleplaying this way was really helpful 15 years ago when we started doing some of the analysis that lead to people figuring out some basic stuff. <br/><br/>People started figuring out that maybe part of the reason they had a hard time playing with certain other people was that they had vastly different goals and desires and assumptions that they were bringing to play.<br/><br/>Also, people started figuring out that maybe the system they were playing wasn't helping them do what they wanted to do. So they started building vastly different types of systems.<br/><br/>And that's all good.<br/><br/>But continuing to shoehorn everything into 3 categories is way too limiting.<br/><br/>Instead of calling all the games and players Gamist or Simulationist or Narrativist, maybe we should start calling them Republican or Democrat or Independant. Then maybe we will be reminded of how the categories are of extremely limited usefulness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342612/#Comment_342612" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T13:33:14+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  1:33PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the definition, you're blaming failure of communication on the baggage of the listener rather than the speaker.  Given that Ron's definition puts "Story Now" as the key to Narrativism, and you say that discussions with "story" always go badly, then I'd say there is a problem with the definition.  <br/><br/>I can certainly see pattern-matching as an ideal in many games.  I've played in many genre-matching games where there were many moments where things just clicked into place as seeming to match just right.  Say, in Angel RPG game where I played the show's character of Cordelia, or in the Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks games that I ran.  Fiasco and Spirit of the Century often had strong elements of genre identification, in my experience.  <br/><br/>As for my non-story-oriented games, I'm not sure what you would want to know.  To distance it from recent Narrativist game designs, I might talk about my 1989 campaign "Worlds in Collision" - I have a <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/worldsincollision/" rel="nofollow"><b>web page</b></a> with some notes on it.  <br/><br/>More recently, I was just writing up some notes on the "Loveless Process" game I had joined.  I don't know exactly what was going through the GM's mind in setting it up, but I could definitely talk about our enjoyment of it - which was not really tied into pattern-matching with an ideal.  The game is about people in the Old West who develop superpowers - but while there is influence, it is far removed from either the Western genre or superheroes.  My character is a 24-year-old actress who is unlikely either as the main character of a Western or as a superhero.  In after-game discussion, we certainly did compare our characters to comic-book superheroes.  Laura was playing an ex-slave whose attachment to his crowbar we compared to Captain America's shield.  However, a lot of it didn't match with anything but was still cool - like how Madeline's character quoted the Bible a lot in his speeches against racism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342614/#Comment_342614" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T13:44:52+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  1:44PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify part of what I meant by my rant:<br/><br/>I think that the pattern-matching, premise-driving, challenge-facing split is a different way of dividing games and players.<br/><br/>And I think it's a really good one that can bring some interesting insight.<br/><br/>And pattern-matching doesn't just mean genre patterns.

Challenge and premise at least have had a lot of discussion thrown at them in the past.

You're free to draw your own implications from the statement, but remember that they are yours and yours alone. I'd appreciate you not projecting them onto me, and instead, asking me to clarify what I'm implying if you feel the need to. Thanks! <br/><br/>But I'll take your bait just a little anyway, because this is the Internet: You don't believe that Step on Up has anything to do with stepping or steps, in any common-use sense of the word, do you? That term isn't part of the <i><b>definition</b></i> of Gamism - it's a nickname, at best a bit of stylistic whimsy and at worst a buzzword. But because the words aren't loaded, like "story" is, Step on Up has never crippled discussions about Gamism that I've been witness to. I'm criticizing the choice of nickname, of buzzword, as obscuring. The definition is fine.\n<blockquote>I'm not sure what you would want to know.</blockquote>\nI asked you to recount your experiences because you said I was wrong about what Sim payoffs looked like in your experience, and because you were like, "Wait, you're making it sound like I need to not care about story to play Nar." I'm saying, "Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying, if your understanding of 'story' involves conscious focus on constructing a structured beginning/middle/end narrative."<br/><br/>So I'm presuming you have things to tell me that I don't know.

Stories are effectively patterns that are being reincorporated and changed over time, featuring a person with a certain status quo who has that status quo broken and seeks to restore it, or who breaks their own status quo for the sake of establishing a better status quo. (Keith Johnstone. Impro. Good stuff.)<br/><br/>We tend to believe that what we want out of fiction is for our views to be challenged, our expectations defied, etc etc. For a lot of people, that isn't really true. Rather, we want the pattern to be confirmed in an unexpected way. We tense when the protagonist of our favorite crime show is in danger, even though <i>we know they're going to get out of this somehow</i>. We know it, and when the steps to it happening are original and resonant and whatever else, we call it a good story. It would suck for those people if that person suddenly died mid-season, and push them out of the experience.<br/><br/>Did you see the movie <i>Kick-Ass</i>? It gets props for being so original and unexpected. But, if you look, all the steps of the coming of age hero story are in it. It's as Campbell as Campbell comes. We get satisfaction from it, because the content, as surprising as it was, holds up the pattern we're wired into. We want resolution for the things that were thrown up in the air. (Did you see Captain America? That's why the ending sucked.)<br/><br/>So, now:<br/><br/>I liken that kind of satisfaction to the satisfaction I get from Sim play. And the thread in common is that there is a sense of "rightness", an ideal, that pervades everything else that happens in the game and exists as a standard by which it is judged. Sometimes that standard gets communicated explicitly up front. Sometimes it doesn't, but becomes evident from conversation that happens around the table - selection of detail, time spent on certain content, etc etc. <br/><br/>Sometimes that standard doesn't revolve around narrative elements. Sometimes it just resolves around mechanical ones. Sometimes, like with theme and Narrativism, we're not really that conscious of what the pattern or ideal is, but damn, do we know when it gets broken. And when it does, it's capital-W Wrong, stop the game and talk about how to fix it kind of wrong.<br/><br/>And when it's right, it's the same kind of satisfaction that comes at the end of a good movie or book or whatever, for me. It feels the same. Narrativism doesn't feel this way.<br/><br/>I'm totally willing to accept this might be unique to me, this similarity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342641/#Comment_342641" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T15:46:40+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  3:46PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I was to take a stab at it first I'd want to clear up what it is we're categorizing and how we are trying to categorize games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Leonard points out above Creative Agenda is a shared group experience, or as Ron recently described it on the Forge (I cant find the exact quote so this is a loose paraphrase) "It's not about how you feel it's about what we do."  So we are not looking for something that everyone is going to latch onto and say oh that was awesome lets do that.  It's not always easily identifiable as why we are playing together, or a big payoff that we expect to get from the game, more importantly it's an agreement on how we are going to treat the imagined content and the way we are going to react to each others input.  It's the way we work together to get what we want out of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically on pattern matching what we have to look for first is the pattern creation.  Start with the setting and what we decide to place in it, what it allows in terms of situations and characters.  As the group makes or prepares for characters what do they expect the characters to do in play, how will they interact with each other what opportunities and interactions will take place between them and the world.  What forces will work on them and what will they have a chance to affect.  All games have patterns but it's how they deal with them that they differ.  When we talk of pattern matching or right to dream play the pattern extends through the situation we've created and tells us how the situation should turn out, we play to find out how it happens we are creating the details through play.   Nar or Gam play both see the situation as a challenge, one is a moral challenge the other a test of ability and skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342644/#Comment_342644" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T15:52:21+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  3:52PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I've mentioned wanting more granular terms to use, I should point out that I wrote an  <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14484" rel="nofollow">Article on Player Motives</a> that I started a thread on here.

But priorities and trends are there.<br/><br/>This way of drawing lines incorporates a big chunk of what was early on described as Narrativism. Because it's drawing lines in different places.</blockquote>\nMy decisions as player were primarily based on "what would she do given my vision of the character", which I think is covered under "verisimilitude" as you intended it.  I think the GM, Mike, often decided on verisimilitude, but also made decisions based on trying to make an interesting conflict.  (Notably, he wanted us to clash with the Southern League, and didn't want us to die.)  <br/><br/>There are a couple possible patterns here, including Western stories, superhero stories, and history.  I think to some degree we looked at what happened compared to all three patterns - but I don't think that was the primary way we viewed things.  I think we mostly looked at features that were interesting and/or original.  We didn't make any decisions based on the genre patterns, though, but we did based on historical  &amp; fictional reality.  We would take these into account in new elements.  For example, when I jumped onto a roof last session we decided it was steeply peaked because in Colorado there is significant snowfall (so roofs are peaked to reduce snow piling up on them).  <br/><br/>Still, there is a lot of room within verisimilitude.  For example, there are innumerable novels that are set within the real world within the limits of realism.  However, I don't think it is right to say that the whole point of those novels is just "to be realistic".  There are a lot of different ways that this game could have gone and stayed within the bounds of the game-world reality, and we were interested in where within those bounds we went - moreso than if we were in the bounds or not.  <br/><br/>Also, both challenge and moral dilemma follow certain patterns.  If you want to lump together all games with pattern-matching, then those would also be similarly categorized.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342648/#Comment_342648" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T16:04:31+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  4:04PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>That's an example of a level of granularity that I find much more useful.</blockquote>\nI've read this!

Not enough categories. Just grouping things into 3 buckets only tells you 2 facts about any one thing - that they are less about the 2 other categories and more about the 1 you put them in. That's why I don't think that any 3-way split is going to tell you everything that's important, or even get very close.<br/><br/>So no, I don't want to lump together all games based on only 3 categories. I'd much rather have 10+ categories and the ability to select several. And put them in some sort of ranking/weighting format.<br/><br/>But I think looking at how a given decision might be made primarily based on pattern-matching against genre conventions, story structure conventions, and "reality" conventions is one interesting thing to look at.

I know that there is one. And it's probably a strong one for a lot of people.<br/><br/>But I consider play and design to be so closely interlinked that, for me, differentiating between the two isn't very useful.<br/><br/>When I run games, I almost always do something to hack at the system because I want it to do something slightly different than how it was written.<br/><br/>When I play games, at some level I always look at how design was part of the success or failure of the game. Sometimes system design shines. Sometimes the GM's design work shines. Sometimes the system hurts. Sometimes the GM's work hurts. Sometimes the GM fails to implement parts of the system successfully and that hurts.<br/><br/>I'm a technical writer by trade. I analyze and describe systems and user interactions both by trade and by habit.<br/><br/>When I first read "system matters" ideas at The Forge, it felt like finally finding my gaming soulmate. Finally I had found people who agreed that systems and structures were important and could be implemented to make certain kinds of satisfying play happen much more reliably than what I had seen happening in the games I was playing.<br/><br/>But, yeah, I get that for you there is a significant difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342670/#Comment_342670" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T17:26:32+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  5:26PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>Hey, Rob?

Part of the intent of the article is that event designers should be able to use it to analyze their players through observation and see behaviors that indicate the likely presence of certain motives.<br/><br/>Yes, there is potential for overlap between some of the categories. In no way do I want to draw strong black lines between things and categorize behaviors as only ever indicative of exactly one player motive that can only be satisfied in exactly one way. The list is more fuzzy than that. But, I think, more useful because of it.<br/><br/>There's been more than 10 years spent trying to categorize things into 3 categories with some precision, and agreement is, as seen in this thread, far from universal. Far be it from me to attempt to precisely and unwaveringly categorize behaviors into 16 motive categories without allowing for exceptions and overlap.<br/><br/>That being said, I think my 16 categories have the potential to directly drive observation and design in a much more reliably useful way than GNS. Using my categories, I can observe player behaviors and dissatisfaction, diagnose it, and design a fix that is likely to be effective. Or, in some cases, observe a dissatisfied player and recommend a different game that they will be much more likely to find satisfying. I've done both of those things before writing the article, and I think the terms in the article make it even easier to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342674/#Comment_342674" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T17:41:10+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  5:41PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2011 5:42PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Honestly, I barely see the differentiation, there.

Design is static. <br/><br/>Human messiness brings too many independent variables to track into an instance of play. On some level, any conversation we have about what we do and what we want in the moment is unreliable, because frankly, we tend to suck at accurately judging ourselves that way. It's easy to accidentally get confirmation or denial of something inaccurate because you asked a leading question. So I tend to stick to the general, and talk about how our group communicates, what we communicate about, what we fail to communicate about, and, where appropriate, agenda. I find that the specific techniques end up falling into place if we can get on the same page about what we're after on a high level.<br/><br/>In a design, I can control the variables, make the thing prioritize what I want it to. What I can't do is make you care about any particular kind of content in play. So I take my concept, and I drill down more specific and go, "I really want this NASCAR game design to have a sense of risk and reward, lots of gambles, because it fits how I perceive the decisions race car drivers make." I don't know what you'll use that element to achieve or prioritize. But I can manifest that element in the system.<br/><br/>Is there a murkiness around drifting and house ruling, along that split? Hell, yes. And there's a lot of fruitful territory in there. But I don't think that makes the split less real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342679/#Comment_342679" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T18:01:41+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  6:01PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2011 6:03PM by stefoid.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>A long time ago I had a Forge discussion on<a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13154.30" rel="nofollow"><b>Classifying by Social Function</b></a>that touches on some similar points.

But can you design to support those types of fun, or are they relegated to things that the players have to bring to the table on their own?  <br/><br/>My feeling is that yes, you can probably <i>emphasize </i> this stuff - largely through description -- setting detail, evocative imagery, etc..   And it obvious that this is important to a lot of people and it sells.<br/><br/>But can the system actively support it?  If it can, tell me how.  Lets call it nebulous fun.   (I dont know, Im shit at picking words that people agree with feel so free to substitue your own)<br/><br/>Personally I dont think that a system that supports <i>only </i>this type of fun could be consistently enjoyable, even if that is possible.  I reckon it would have to be supported within a more nuts and bolts concrete framework.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342681/#Comment_342681" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T18:13:20+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  6:13PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

There is only memory and the future.<br/><br/>And if I didn't enjoy the play, I want to look at how to tweak the design to make it so that, next time, I'm more likely to enjoy it. Partly that's because I view, for example, everything the GM does, both before and during the game, as part of design. Partly, it's because I've never considered a system design to be complete and inviolate. I've been system hacking for almost as long as I've been playing. When I see a problem that I think can be improved through a change in the system, I change the system.<br/><br/>I totally get where you're coming from.

That has nothing to do with what you'll do when you've got the book and are going to run the game for people.<br/><br/>It's that thing Jason Corley keeps harping on. Once my text is out there, and in the hands of live players, the system is necessarily subject to modification based on what you and yours want to prioritize.

And with boffer larp campaigns, there's a tighter correlation between system design, event design, and production. Cause you usually don't run someone else's system. Or if you do, you do so much event design work that it's hard not to consider it design work.<br/><br/>The larp focus has given me a heavy orientation toward system-driven change. When you have 50 people at an event, you get a lot more mileage out of a system tweak than out of trying to negotiate the social contract. Both help. But it's best to make sure the system is doing what you want it to be doing. Cause trying to ignore or overcome the system is progressively harder the more players you have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342693/#Comment_342693" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T19:14:25+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  7:14PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>I asked you to recount your experiences because you said I was wrong about what Sim payoffs looked like in your experience, and because you were like, "Wait, you're making it sound like I need to not care about story to play Nar." I'm saying, "Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying, if your understanding of 'story' involves conscious focus on constructing a structured beginning/middle/end narrative."<br/><br/>So I'm presuming you have things to tell me that I don't know. I'm happy to learn them. I'm curious as to how you view your "Loveless Process" game, in light of all this. It is a Big Model Sim game, you think? Is it Nar? Do you know yet? Does it matter? What about my experiences doesn't jive with how you understand this stuff?</blockquote>\nMy opinion is that Loveless Process could be either Big Model Sim or Nar depending on whose view you go by, because the definitions are inconsistent.  I think it matters in how we talk about the relation of games, because GNS suggests a vital difference in games.  <br/><br/>You haven't talked a lot about your gaming experience - but the point that seems tricky for me is if Sandbox play, Threefold Simulationist play, and/or "what if" play are considered Narrativist.  I'm not at all opposed to this, but I think it would have major implications for the broader view of the progression of game design.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>Did you see the movie<i>Kick-Ass</i>? It gets props for being so original and unexpected. But, if you look, all the steps of the coming of age hero story are in it. It's as Campbell as Campbell comes. We get satisfaction from it, because the content, as surprising as it was, holds up the pattern we're wired into. We want resolution for the things that were thrown up in the air. (Did you see Captain America? That's why the ending sucked.)<br/><br/>So, now:<br/><br/>I liken that kind of satisfaction to the satisfaction I get from Sim play. And the thread in common is that there is a sense of "rightness", an ideal, that pervades everything else that happens in the game and exists as a standard by which it is judged. Sometimes that standard gets communicated explicitly up front. Sometimes it doesn't, but becomes evident from conversation that happens around the table - selection of detail, time spent on certain content, etc etc.<br/><br/>Sometimes that standard doesn't revolve around narrative elements. Sometimes it just resolves around mechanical ones. Sometimes, like with theme and Narrativism, we're not really that conscious of what the pattern or ideal is, but damn, do we know when it gets broken. And when it does, it's capital-W Wrong, stop the game and talk about how to fix it kind of wrong.<br/><br/>And when it's right, it's the same kind of satisfaction that comes at the end of a good movie or book or whatever, for me. It feels the same. Narrativism doesn't feel this way.<br/><br/>I'm totally willing to accept this might be unique to me, this similarity.</blockquote>\nI didn't see Kick-Ass, but I did see the recent Captain America film.  I recently posted my <a href="http://jhkim.livejournal.com/47090.html" rel="nofollow"><b>thoughts on it</b></a> on my personal LiveJournal.  Basically, I was disappointed by the second half, though not by the ending in particular.  <br/><br/>I can definitely identify with the feeling of "rightness" when something perfectly matches with expectations for the genre - often in an unexpected way.  I can see exactly that feeling in many games with strong genre grounding like Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Call of Cthulhu, Spirit of the Century, and Fiasco.  I don't feel this in sandbox games, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342698/#Comment_342698" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T19:46:15+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  7:46PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Penny is totally Narrativist.

As a dude who put a lot of time and effort into understanding G/N/S in 2006-2007, I thought it would be fun to share what parts of that understanding I've found useful, useless, and useful-if-changed.  <br/><br/>I used to think that in designing a game, in eliciting buy-in to a game, in helping a group get on the same page about a game, that it would be extremely useful for me to understand whether that game was going to be Simulationist or Narrativist.  I no longer think that is the case, for any of those.  <br/><br/>It's important to know what the game's goals are.  It's important to know what the players get to do.  If you can get players excited about doing what they get to do in your game, that's enough group cohesion.<br/><br/>I think my understanding of Gamism vs Not helps me define and communicate what players get to do in my games.  I've found that focusing on RPG play as collaboration, and focusing on appreciated contributions, is invaluable.  I've found certain poles and archetypes of Nar and Sim useful for occasional reference.  Any GNS thought beyond that I've found to be a waste of time.<br/><br/>I'm going to see if I can make an example of this via my Penny game with Matt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342710/#Comment_342710" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T22:18:31+00:00" title="September 13, 2011 10:18PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2011 10:25PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Penny is totally Narrativist.

It's this idea that there's a map and stuff on it, and we don't have any strong front-loading of premise, we just explore the map and interact with what's there.<br/><br/>I'm not as familiar with the Threefold Model, and I don't know what you mean by "what if" play, except for a presumption on my part that it last explicit goals other than the creation of a situation that you run with.<br/><br/>From a position of ignorance, I'd suggest that there's no default reason why any of those couldn't result in Narrativist play. That doesn't mean they will. I don't know enough about those play styles to comment on the likelihood of those behaviors emerging.<br/><br/>As for my experience, do you mean my gaming history? Or do you mean, the games I'm running and playing in right now? What information would be helpful? In previous posts, I've been talking in aggregate - lots of gaming experiences that show trends. But I'm happy to talk in specifics too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I used to think that in designing a game, in eliciting buy-in to a game, in helping a group get on the same page about a game, that it would be extremely useful for me to understand whether that game was going to be Simulationist or Narrativist.

A game design can't be Nar, Sim, or Gam by definition - it can make achieving any of them easier or harder, but words on a page don't have a creative agenda. People do, live and in motion, doing things and establishing priorities. And I've never found it mattered much what we said the game was beforehand - you can't decide what you care about until it's in front of you and you're making decisions. You don't need to be playing Dogs or Polaris or Sorcerer to have a Nar experience - it just makes the path there more straightforward, with more synergy between the conversation you're having and the system in play. And you can't sit down to play Fate and go, "We're going to play a Narrativist Fate game now." I mean, you could, but it'd be useless, because you have no idea what you're going to actually do with your group when the rubber hits the road.<br/><br/>I mean, here's a thing that happened to me six months ago: I wanted to take some younger friends of mine through some nostalgic, old-school, simple dungeon bashing, 'cause they're young enough that their first D&amp;D was 3rd Edition. I picked True20, we made up a sketchy premise for them to be together (they are children of prophecy, basically), and off they went, after a lengthy conversation about the merits of ye olde dungeon bashing and what it meant. Gamism, here we come, right?<br/><br/>First encounter with bugbears, they capture some and decide to talk to them and find out what their motivations are. And you have to understand, as a GM, I almost never say no to a player impulse in the moment, ever. (Improv rule.) So, I make up a motivation for the bugbears. By the end of the session, they're in negotiations with the chieftain, and they have a treaty with the bugbears to settle in a part of their land.<br/><br/>Their hometown pretty much hates this. So they say, "Screw you," and take a number of sympathetic townsfolk, and go make a joint colony with the bugbears. And now, this game is about their struggle to build a sense of community, deal with the demands of their supposed destinies, and deal with trying to maintain their relationships to certain people in the hometown despite the sense of alienation that's arisen.<br/><br/>WTF, right? Even better - we ditched True20 when we realized none of the crap on their sheet mattered ever in the course of play, and made it a Smallville game. And then later, a PTA game, when we realized we didn't want strict restrictions on saying what magic could do and just wanted it available as grist for the color mill, and I wanted to spend less time in prep. It's now in its second season, as a PTA game.<br/><br/>It couldn't be more abashedly Narrativist if they'd picked the word "Narrativist" out of this sentence, blown it up to 1000 pt., grabbed the end of the "t", and hit me over the head with the "N". I know that now. I didn't then. So it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342758/#Comment_342758" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T09:49:02+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  9:49AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2011 9:58AM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I was introduced to the whole concept of creative agenda as "bad games are bad because they give no hint about about whether they're to be played as G or N or S and so groups get together to try to play them and want different things and that is the cause of all the misery in the RPG world".  And I was like, "oh shit, I don't want to do that!"<br/><br/>If you trust players to respond to each other's likes and interests and enthusiasm in the moment at the table, then there is no point in thinking in CA terms ever*.  Perhaps your Bugbear-lovers are an example of this.  But I've had plenty of experiences where it was a little murky regarding what one could do that would matter to the other players, and for a time "pick a CA!" (in design, in pitch, in facilitation) seemed to me to be a vital part of the solution.  Because I was told it was.  By Ron.  <br/><br/>I'm sure I wasn't the only one.<br/><br/>To be fair, "is this really a test of player skill, or just a test of character skill, and will the players be able to tell the difference?" is still a question I ask... I've found the answer <i>does</i> matter...<br/><br/>*Is there?  You still want to communicate what your game is good for so it'll get played by the people who want that, but you needn't look through the lens of CA to achieve that.  There seem to be plenty of superior options like "player interaction", "product of play", etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342763/#Comment_342763" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T10:09:28+00:00" title="September 14, 2011 10:09AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>First encounter with bugbears, they capture some and decide to talk to them and find out what their motivations are.

By the end of the session, they're in negotiations with the chieftain, and they have a treaty with the bugbears to settle in a part of their land.<br/><br/>Their hometown pretty much hates this. So they say, "Screw you," and take a number of sympathetic townsfolk, and go make a joint colony with the bugbears. And now, this game is about their struggle to build a sense of community, deal with the demands of their supposed destinies, and deal with trying to maintain their relationships to certain people in the hometown despite the sense of alienation that's arisen.<br/><br/>WTF, right? Even better - we ditched True20 when we realized none of the crap on their sheet mattered ever in the course of play, and made it a Smallville game. And then later, a PTA game, when we realized we didn't want strict restrictions on saying what magic could do and just wanted it available as grist for the color mill, and I wanted to spend less time in prep.

You could poke holes in my statement and find exceptions. But I still think it's a clue.<br/><br/>But like I said, I think CA is best viewed as a radar chart. If they're making more choices based on a priority of premise, then the game is a little more Nar than otherwise.<br/><br/>I don't think it's quite as 100% Nar as Leonard thinks, though. I'm guessing there is some degree of focus on "what would it be like if this sort of thing were really happening". At least some of his decisions (and the players') are probably driven by the desire to enhance verisimilitude.<br/><br/>Which is why I think that too much time is spent trying to categorize the whole.<br/><br/>At the holistic level, I think there 3 totally different categories that matter - games that are super fun, games that are unfun, and games that could be a little better.<br/><br/>Looking at Leonard's example, his game was, at certain points, in the "could be better" category. So they changed systems to find something that would better facilitate what they wanted to do.

I know that those ideas helped me sort out a lot of what goes on in my gaming, and despite the fact that I don't sit and analyze all my play in terms of CA, or even really think about it all that much anymore, it doesn't mean the ideas aren't important. The main active use of CA I've experienced is helping me identify different kinds of shear at the table that I simply didn't have a term for before - you know, I'd get players who would state their issues with the game mainly in terms of techniques, "We should do more of X." We should react more in the moment, we should be more strict about in character and out of character knowledge, we fail too much, we don't fail enough - a million different things. And changing those techniques didn't fix anything, because the techniques were not the issue at hand. (This happened in a lot of my 90's White Wolf play.)<br/><br/>Compare this to one of the Skype games I'm playing in right now (Aethertide, a Cortex+ hack to run Mage: The Ascension; Ryan Macklin's blogged about it a couple of times) - the system has been in flux since the first session. It started as an incomplete thing, and we've been modifying it to get closer to what we've wanted, changing the way stuff works nearly every session. But I've never had a sense that anything was wrong with the game - every session is a rollicking awesome four hours. So, could I tell you about what CA I think is manifesting in play? Sure.

I know it to be Narrativist because of what we spend time at our table doing.<br/><br/>It has hippy-ish themes, yeah. But, that isn't the important part. The important part is that it's all we talk about. The emphasis is on the struggle, and the choices that the struggle forces them to make. <br/><br/>We haven't even barely gone anywhere, on the world map. In fact, there is no world map. We've spent absolutely no time actually figuring out the geography of our world. A new nation or city gets invented precisely when it becomes relevant, usually as whatever content is necessary to cement whatever difficult situation the PCs are dealing with into place. New details get invented all the time as ways of justifying the outcomes of conflicts, instead of being reasons why conflicts are staged/modified. Was there a baseline that we started with? Sure, 'cause I thought we were going to be dungeon-ing it up. But we're way past that now. I know only about the places the PCs have been to.<br/><br/>Same thing with its economies, political structures, etc etc. What I can tell you about the setting all comes from what content we needed to invent to bring a sense of tangibility to the moral and ethical conflicts the PCs are facing, so they aren't anonymous. The world is a pawn of the drama. And I could say that about the genre, the tone, etc etc. We're not exploring the content for its own sake. We're doing something with it.<br/><br/>And sure, part of that has to do with the few beginning-of-session prompts I get to choose, as GM. Instead of prompting, "OMG, there's a raiding party of orcs in the hills and they're massing to attack your town! What do you do?" I prompt, "The apprentice you've been training in fire magic has killed two people while practicing, on a farm that's between your colony and your old hometown. The hometown demands justice and she begs you for protection. What do you do?" <br/><br/>But we could easily see how that might become a Gamist enterprise of "can we meet the challenge of going to war with our old hometown". Right, like, I don't control how they're going to respond to the prompt. But it <i>doesn't</i>. It just doesn't. It stays with the human decisions and actions of the participants, how they get complicated, what consequences roll out of their decisions, etc etc. It stays with, "Is it the right thing to do to allow your apprentice to avoid justice? Are you willing to sacrifice your relationship with the hometown? How does that affect your friends? How will you explain it to the villagers when the hometown cuts off trade?" <br/><br/>Right, it's not the presence of any one of these issues in play that makes it Narrativist. It's the fact that we spend almost no time in play dealing with, literally, anything else in great detail, or for any reason besides the fact that it pushes or sets up these problems. <br/><br/>And the change in system speaks to that, right? It's telling that a player was like, "You know, my guy has all this fire magic and stuff, but the way we've been playing, clearly it doesn't matter how good he is at it. We never care about 'does he have enough fire magic to kill that ogre' or whatever." <br/><br/>Emphasis, and lack of emphasis. I don't know how much clearer I can be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342794/#Comment_342794" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T12:52:06+00:00" title="September 14, 2011 12:52PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>Perhaps, perhaps not.

At its least extreme, this is pure emulation. At its most extreme, it is parody. In between, you get modifications like "Lovecraft on a starship" or "steampunk fantasy" and so on. In each case, the goals are just as I've stated with (a) and (b)."<br/>\n<br/>\nVerisimilitude has nothing to do with having that complete package.

New details get invented all the time as ways of justifying the outcomes of conflicts, instead of being reasons why conflicts are staged/modified. Was there a baseline that we started with? Sure, 'cause I thought we were going to be dungeon-ing it up. But we're way past that now. I know only about the places the PCs have been to.</br></br></blockquote>\nIt is strongly implied here that the lack of a world map is evidence towards Narrativism and against Simulationism.

So here's my take on the same thing: All games contain to some degree elements of player challenge, elements of fidelity/ideal/blah, and elements of human drama. That fact doesn't speak to creative agenda - they're all necessary to the experience to some degree.<br/><br/>Creative agenda manifests in prioritization of those elements over time. The way I perceive it, that prioritization is either overt (where you simply attend to one of the elements more than others) or covert (where the attention you pay to one of the elements turns out to be in the service of facilitating another). <br/><br/>So I don't find a lot of use in referring to partial agendas, but that doesn't mean I fail to acknowledge that it's not 100% challenge or fidelity or drama, 100% of the time. I'm more likely to say, "Narrativist, where challenge impacts play in X way and fidelity impacts play in X way." When I know, that is. Sometimes I don't.<br/><br/>But really, it's just that I reserve the agenda terms for that high-level sense of overall emphasis. We're agreeing. We perceive the same phenomenon. I just get particular about language sometimes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342831/#Comment_342831" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T15:49:42+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  3:49PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>It is strongly implied here that the lack of a world map is evidence towards Narrativism and against Simulationism.</blockquote>\nIn my game, sure.

I'm cool with that.<br/><br/>I would argue that positioning it as an emergent behavior that can only be labeled after the fact means that it's something that I can't make use of in prep, only in analysis after the fact of why something was better or worse than I'd hoped. And most of the time I'm more concerned with things I can make at least some use of in prep.<br/><br/>I can prep for challenge. I can prep for verisimilitude/pattern matching. I can prep for premise. (And doing so doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to railroad my players or tell them my prescripted story or whatever). So those things are useful to me.<br/><br/>Figuring out which of those is a group priority or my priority or whatever isn't nearly as useful to me. Cause I like all of them a lot. And the main group I'm playing with right now is mixed on their preferences but they really don't care cause they have fun when I bring any of those things to the table. The more I am on the ball with bringing any of that stuff, the happier they are.<br/><br/>It helps sometimes, like in understanding why I struggle to have fun with some groups and have an easier time with others.

In these, I cannot picture that I would change the map in order to fit better with address of premise - certainly I can't recall ever doing so.  Particularly in the case of a historical setting like Vinland, I definitely do think of the map as being a real thing unto itself apart from the game.  Even for Harn, while it is fictional, that same fictional reality is used for many different stories.  <br/><br/>I feel like there may be misinterpretation of what that means in terms of priority, though.  When I hold things like the map or other aspects of reality sacrosanct - it is because I am interested in what comes out of them.  It is parallel to different ways of handling research done for a historical novel.  One extreme approach is to have a story in mind, and then adjust the historical reality to allow it.  Another extreme is to keep history exactly as written, and fit the story to it.  <br/><br/>I wouldn't call the latter "fetishizing," though.  I just tend to find it more interesting to see where things go based on the map that I have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342889/#Comment_342889" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T22:18:14+00:00" title="September 14, 2011 10:18PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John:<br/><br/>In those games, what kind of activity arose around those maps?

Things that happen in the world are only relevant insofar as they impinge on the character and his/her quest. Or another way to say this is the things that happen in their world are presented precisely for the relevance that they have to the character's struggles. Everything else may be background color, but is not really of importance.<br/><br/>Another approach is to place a character in a world and make the interaction with the world central to the game. The character experiences the world and moves through it as an observer/actor. They may or may not have explicit and nuanced aspirations. Or their aspirations may be malleable and opportunistic. Things happen in their world that may or may not have relevance to their struggles. The events that occur in their environment are presented because the world is there for the exploring. And the focus is on the interaction between character and world, rather than the way the world impinges on the character.<br/><br/>So, an example from my early D&amp;D days. We would each create a character. The GM would have a world prepared and we would start, say, in a town. We'd wander through the town talking to people, listening for rumors, looking for a merchant caravan or a noble in need or a damsel in distress. You know, trying to find the adventure. The characters aspirations were a given. We were adventurers. Sometimes it was glossed with a desire to vanquish evil, but really it was about fun and challenge and exploration. Eventually, we'd run into the various NPCs with problems that adventurers could solve and we'd be off to the races. <br/><br/>Contrast that with my recent Burning Wheel games. We create characters together. We create beliefs that drive the characters and pay attention to how those beliefs intersect and how they fit into the overall world we are imagining. The GM, in particular, is looking for ways in which his world is going to challenge those beliefs, what the NPCs want that will have impact on the characters and put the question to the beliefs we have created.

How were they consulted? What were they used for? How much time in game was spent reconciling the action of play to the maps? Did you ever end up with a weird moment where you couldn't reconcile what was going on in the game against the map? Did you ever fudge distances for the sake of plot contrivance, convenience, or other reasons? Did the other players share and support your use of the map, or were they less inclined to focus on it except as a matter of color? Did play force you to change the maps in any way that didn't grow out of in-game events (like, not the players destroying a city)?<br/><br/>Would it be too much to ask for really specific examples, along any of these lines of inquiry?</blockquote>\nNo, it's not too much trouble.  I generally had the poster-sized USGS maps of the area out somewhere as we played.  We didn't have any hexes or calculations based on the map, but whenever characters would go so someplace new, we would look over the map for their route and they had some idea of the distance and landscape.  I don't think we had times of reconciling to the maps, since they were generally out before the players would go someplace.  I also had the maps pretty well internalized since it was the area I had grown up in (except in an alternate 1392).  So, for example, when they headed west on campaign to help fight against the Susquehannock, we traced out their route.  Alternately, after a few battle campaigns as a leader, the famed huscarl Skallagrim (played by Jim) had enough resources to get his own land.  Around the same time he made his marriage proposal to the widow Borgny the Sharp-Tongued.  We scanned through the USGS maps looking for where he would be likely to set up his own longhouse, or perhaps take over an unused homestead.  I think I gave some advice, as it ended up being by modern-day Irvington-on-Hudson where the lab I used to work is.  The placement had lots of little consequences.  He was nearly directly across the wide river from his close ties at Brygjafael, but also close to the troublesome family at Tjaraholt.  They were a long boat ride from Borgny's family at Groenholt on the Manhattan's island.  <br/><br/>I don't recall ever fudging distances.  I can't picture why I would.  Except for a few times when on war-campaign (like the battle at Ticonderoga), players would usually go from one homestead to another (or tribal encampment), and the wilderness in between was not given much attention.  Mainly, I think they gave players a way to picture the landscape that they were in.  I suppose that would be color.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>I'm not sure changing or not changing the historical reality is all that important to the discussion of priorities.<br/><br/>One approach is to place the characters' goals central in the game and draw from the environment as a source of obstacles and evocative detail that brings that character's struggle into relief.

Or another way to say this is the things that happen in their world are presented precisely for the relevance that they have to the character's struggles. Everything else may be background color, but is not really of importance.<br/><br/>Another approach is to place a character in a world and make the interaction with the world central to the game. The character experiences the world and moves through it as an observer/actor. They may or may not have explicit and nuanced aspirations. Or their aspirations may be malleable and opportunistic. Things happen in their world that may or may not have relevance to their struggles. The events that occur in their environment are presented because the world is there for the exploring. And the focus is on the interaction between character and world, rather than the way the world impinges on the character.<br/><br/>So, an example from my early D&amp;D days. We would each create a character. The GM would have a world prepared and we would start, say, in a town. We'd wander through the town talking to people, listening for rumors, looking for a merchant caravan or a noble in need or a damsel in distress. You know, trying to find the adventure. The characters aspirations were a given. We were adventurers. Sometimes it was glossed with a desire to vanquish evil, but really it was about fun and challenge and exploration. Eventually, we'd run into the various NPCs with problems that adventurers could solve and we'd be off to the races.<br/><br/>Contrast that with my recent Burning Wheel games. We create characters together. We create beliefs that drive the characters and pay attention to how those beliefs intersect and how they fit into the overall world we are imagining. The GM, in particular, is looking for ways in which his world is going to challenge those beliefs, what the NPCs want that will have impact on the characters and put the question to the beliefs we have created. There's no notion that there are characters or places "out there" in the world that we need to seek in order to expose the adventure. We are going to be confronted by those things by virtue of pursuing our stated beliefs. Exploring the world for the sake of it would be strange in this setting.

When I last played Burning Wheel, it was a long campaign set in the game-world of Harn - which is a very detailed fantasy world that has a ton of detail out there.  We were playing religious missionaries of the god Ilvir trying to establish a temple and congregation in a new city - Coranan, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081005084542/http://pages.sbcglobal.net/jchokey/city/general/intro/index.html" rel="nofollow"><b>City of Red Domes</b></a>.  There was a lot of detail available about the world, but we never explored the world for the sake of it.  We went to places in following our beliefs and goals.  (And as missionaries, we had some very strong beliefs.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342927/#Comment_342927" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T11:04:55+00:00" title="September 15, 2011 11:04AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>It also makes clear why predetermined plot is compatible with sandbox play - in sandbox, the characters are reactive and they need something to react to, whereas when the characters are self-driven, its the GM who is reactive.</blockquote>\nI've been reading some OSR blogs lately and I'm pretty sure they'd scream and yell and say hell no you don't get it at all.<br/><br/>They way I've seen them describe sandbox is this:<br/><br/>The world is the way the world is. When you go to a place, you see the stuff that's there. That stuff may change due to your actions either at that place or at other places.<br/><br/>Most of the threats in a sandbox world are semi-static. Some of them are kind of active, like the kidnappers who just look the merchant's daughter. But even that's pretty static, because mostly they're just waiting in their cave while their face man organizes a ransom.<br/><br/>So there's this cave, like in Keep on the Borderlands. And in it are lots of monsters. But until you go there, they're pretty much in stasis. But the guy at the keep wants to mine in that cave, so he's sent you to check it out, see if mining is possible, see if there are threats that would prevent miners from going there. So you go there, and maybe you slaughter them all. Or maybe you talk to some of the groups and get them to help you wipe out the other groups and become paid guards for the miners. Or maybe you say fuck this and bail on the keep and head to some other part of the world.<br/><br/>The plot is not predetermined. Very much not. Just the starting situation and some of the most likely triggers have been planned. The players, in that sandbox, can choose what sort of activities they want to pursue, given that the situation is the way it is.<br/><br/>In a way, sandbox play is a heck of a lot like the structure in many modern videogames. There's this thing there waiting for you to find it if you go over there. And when you do, you get some sort of prompt. And you decide how you're going to react to that prompt. And in the best games (both the video games and the rpgs) you have lots of choices of approach and resolution. Things could turn out lots of different ways.<br/><br/>They're only "prescripted" in that the starting situation was set up a certain way, and is waiting to be triggered. But that's only a start. It's not a resolution.<br/><br/>Many OSR folks mark a huge sea change in module design when Hickman started producing the Dragonlance modules. In those, instead of creating a detailed starting situation to interact with in many different ways, they started writing "story modules" with beginnings, middles, and endings that were meant to happen pretty much a certain way. HUGE difference.<br/><br/>I've been reading some old modules and using them in my game. Keep on the Borderlands, Village of Hommlet, Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh, Dwellers in the Forbidden City. I've tweaked them all a bit and placed the locations all close by to each other. So I've made this sandbox that my players can explore around in for months and months and there's always tons of stuff for them to bump into or seek out. Fun stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342932/#Comment_342932" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T11:31:33+00:00" title="September 15, 2011 11:31AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Various">@Various</a> folks who're discussing the whole issue of the world map.<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time understanding how holding the map sacrosanct excludes the game from being Narrativist.

Does that mean that if you do not fudge dice rolls, you're not playing Narr?<br/><br/>The way I see it, creating a story together out of blank canvas is basically freeform storytelling. In order for an RPG / Story Game to be what it is, it needs to have a set of parameters that will act as boundaries for the storytelling. Rules are a boundary you can set. Genre is a boundary you can set. Theme is a boundary you can set. Why can't a world map be a boundary you can set? I don't really see how it's different from other boundaries.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342958/#Comment_342958" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T14:02:36+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  2:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>It also makes clear why predetermined plot is compatible with sandbox play - in sandbox, the characters are reactive and they need something to react to, whereas when the characters are self-driven, its the GM who is reactive.</blockquote>\nThey're only "prescripted" in that the starting situation was set up a certain way, and is waiting to be triggered.

Prescripted, to me, implies planned conclusions, which are anathema to most who lovingly use the term sandbox.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone would accuse Apocalypse World of encouraging prescripted play. In fact, it tells you directly (and using cursewords for emphasis, as I recall) not to plan endings. But the game gives you tools to build threats, and to group those threats into fronts. It specifically tells you not to try to do that part on the fly, but instead to do it during prep. So you are encouraged to prep these people and places and things that will be the threats, and to do that before play.<br/><br/>OSR sandbox play is extremely similar in design and intent. It just uses slightly less sophisticated tools for doing it (and a much less amazing system for implementing it in play).<br/><br/>The whole point of calling it sandbox play is to emphasize the player agency - their ability to make meaningful choices and determine where they will go and what they will face. To look at a set of possible things to focus on and choose one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342960/#Comment_342960" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T14:27:44+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  2:27PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being able to interact freely with the prepped material, with the GM simply "relating" it to you, makes a difference when I'm playing.<br/>I will always sit down for a dungeon crawl, 'cause I have sort of a blank canvas (just the monsters and traps and scenery) on which I can place some meaning or drama or characterization. <br/>On the other hand, the structure of a story line or plot feels confining; I don't mind an adventure that's linear in design, but if I can't poke around as I please, and instead get nudged back towards something in particular, it's going to ruin my fun. <br/><br/>For me, the difference is not about how predetermined the content is vs. how much is determined in play; it's about whether that material can coexist peacefully with what  I want to do as a character, or not. <br/>But when the flow of events has been predetermined, it just makes it less fun.

(It no longer is, but at one point it would have been, so let's pretend.)  I have to ask, could it have been anything else?  Could it have been Sim?  Matt, can you think of any evidence that would indicate that?<br/><br/>Now let's take a different angle.  Can you think of anything that might make it not Nar?<br/><br/>Um, if you don't wanna play this game, just say so, but I think this will be more fun as a back-and-forth than as me just ranting.<br/><br/>Penny can be kinda blah, i.e. incoherent, if it just doesn't gel, but I have real trouble seeing how you could force it into another creative agenda.  It's one of the most focused Narr-supporting games there is.  There's simply no basis on which either of the other two could emerge.  (Unlike, say, Dogs, where in theory one could get very absorbed in the dice strategy.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342974/#Comment_342974" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T16:05:01+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  4:05PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No no no, I don't mean Penny the Ruleset, I mean the actual session of Penny that we played.

class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Sure, but on a scale from 'railroad' at one end to 'completely flying by the seat of my pants' at the other, your example is still more towards the predetermined end of things.  This stuff exists before you start play and its there for the characters to discover and react to.</blockquote>\nI think that the common understanding of "railroad" is really independent of whether the plot is preplanned or not.  I have definitely been in games where the GM has been coming up with material off-the-cuff, but is still exercising total control over the plot without the players having meaningful choices - i.e. "railroading by the seat of one's pants".<br/><br/>In contrast, I think a sandbox style means that the players are not being directed down a GM-determined path, but rather have a lot of freedom of choice to pick areas and activities of interest to them.<br/><br/>Ill buy what everyone is saying.  But its still 'the box comes first and the players react to what they find in it', right?  whereas the other way, the characters comes first and the world/GM reacts to them.  I mean, sure, in a sandbox game you could first create the characters, then the box, with a view to the box being a custom fit for those characters.  Do many people do it that way?  I think a lot of the fun of sandbox play for the GM sounds to me like they get to design the box and then release the rats in it and see what they do  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In Ingenero I am encouraging  creating PCs first, and the GM creating  a cast of NPCs with very little predetermined places and no predetermined events.  The box is filled with (hopefully) lovingly detailed, complex and motivated NPCs for the PCs to discover and interact with.  More like a box you throw two groups of rats into, and see what happens.<br/><br/>Actually now that I describe it that way, it stills sounds like sandbox with a different emphasis.   I guess the important distinction is which comes first, the PCs or the box?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342998/#Comment_342998" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T19:25:20+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  7:25PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>No no no, I don't mean Penny the Ruleset, I mean the actual session of Penny that we played.

(Actually I will talk about an actual game of Penny here, though it was a con game and I didn't get a chance to really interrogate the rest of the table about what they liked/disliked with any kind of specificity.)<br/><br/>I'm sitting down with a bunch of horror genre fans and everyone has their own thing that they like in horror. And as we play, we gravitate the game towards a certain set of horror elements.<br/><br/>In specific, we created a sort of Hammer/1970s horror game, like a British novel where the vicar is in it with Satan in order to corrupt the town, and many unsettling/evil things happen for no real Reason (capital R, because the breakdown of reality under the influence of the devil was one of the elements, in the end the devil was the small-r reason for things happening.)<br/><br/>As it became clearer the direction the game was going, the options offered began to more firmly ensconce themselves in the world of that kind of horror.  At first we had some Cthuloid stuff, but that fell away, nobody pursued that. A couple of times there was a serial killer subplot - in the end we didn't resolve that either.  By the time we came to the end of the session, the group had directed the story into a very specific subgenre and were having a blast with it.<br/><br/>Now, I don't believe in Sim or Narr or any of that stuff, but <i>in no way</i> was the play of the game addressing an Egri/Edwards/Narr moral premise. It simply was not, the players had no such interest in any such premises, even less so than Cthulhu. Instead, it was the creation of a creepy story, with concrete decisions that enhanced the horror mood and allowed us to collectively determine, without pre-planning, even! what type of horror we wanted to evoke, and the details of the story.<br/><br/>Penny is a wonderful story game, I really liked it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343016/#Comment_343016" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T22:19:41+00:00" title="September 15, 2011 10:19PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>Heh.

(It's perhaps a subtle thing, but I like the text and flavor and magic from the Hero Wars more than subsequent Hero Quest books for the setting of Glorantha.)<br/><br/>Glorantha, if you don't know, has been in development in one form or another for 35 years. There are tons of maps, cultures, history, gods, and so on. <br/><br/>Here are the key books I'm drawing from using the primary source materials I'm working from:<br/>* <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=12433&amp;it=1&amp;affiliate_id=35526" rel="nofollow"><i>Thunder Rebels</i></a> <br/>* <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=12429&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow"><i>Glorantha - Introduction to the Hero Wars</i></a><br/>* the original two books from the orginal <i>Hero Wars</i> game which contain lots of setting information baked into the rules<br/>* the three volume campaign of <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=sartar&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;quicksearch=1&amp;search_filter=&amp;filters=&amp;search_free=&amp;search_in_description=1&amp;search_in_author=1&amp;search_in_artist=1" rel="nofollow">Sartar Rising</a> which contains tons of setting material<br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=89872" rel="nofollow">The Dragon Pass Gazetteer</a><br/>* and Ian Cooper's brilliant home brew campaign setting, <a href="http://iancooper.brinkster.net/glorantha/sartar/redcow/Book%20of%20the%20Red%20Cow.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Book of the Red Cow</a>, which lovingly lays out a single clan, it's history and enemies over 110 pages.<br/><br/>The above list does not include a supplemental book to Thunder Rebels called <i>Storm Tribes</i>, two volumes about The Lunar Empire, and a book about the Uz -- the trolls of Glorantha. Though I'll probably be reading them and adding their information into the mix over time.<br/><br/>I have typed up handouts. Emailed maps. Picked through the books to send key details. At the first session last week, I opened the game with reading a page out loud from Thunder Rebels -- a lovely passage written in the voice of a Hoertling clansman.<br/><br/>At the first session all we did was go down a list of 30 questions from one of the <i>Satar Rising </i>books (and re-worked very well in Moon Design's <a href="http://moondesignpublications.com/products/sartar-kingdom-of-heroes/" rel="nofollow">Sartar, Kingdom of Heroes</a> sourcebook to create their Heortling tribe. I read the questions -- filling in details about Heortling culture, history and gods. The Players answered, getting a sense of the world and their clan's values.<br/><br/>That's all we had time to do (BUT IT WAS A BLAST! Lots of laughing. A great time had by all.)<br/><br/>Tuesday is our second session and we'll make Characters, the clan's guardian spirit, NPCs that the PCs have relationships with, family trees and so on.<br/><br/>So.. lots of detail. Maps. Culture pre-boxed...<br/><br/>But... Glorantha and Heortling culture is rich in situation. The Heortlins have been invaded by the Lunar Empire. Is the Empire's Red Goddess stronger than the Heortling's Storm Pantheon. Should they resist and try to throw off their conquerer's rule? Should they turn back on their gods and follow the way of the Red Goddess, as their Heorlting cousins to the north have? The gods are at war and so are the humans on the lands below them.<br/><br/>Moreover, the Players, in answering a question, have decided their clan is using the collapse of their kingdom as an opportunity to strike at a neighboring clan for some payback for old grudges. <br/><br/>The players can also come up with conflicts within the clan structure -- over love, betrayal in marriage, acts of violence, stolen cattle, lack of respect, and so on -- because Heortling culture is ripe with grabby material for Players to grab and plug into their Characters. <br/><br/>Or they might want to track a cursed beast that might end up doing greater harm to their home and clan if they fail to kill it. <br/><br/>They could rile up their fellow Orlanthi toward rebellion against the Lunar Empires. Steal cattle from neighbors to increase their personal wealth at the risk of inciting a feud. They could embark n a quest to find magical aid to strengthen their gods against the Red Goddess, knowing that if the Lunar soldiers find out they'll come in hard and punish those they love.<br/><br/>And the HeroQuest rules support this brilliantly. One can write things like "Hates Tribal Chief 18," and suddenly a political in-fight within the tribal culture is part of the game mechanics for the Players to use. One can have things like, "Hates Father 13," or "Will Spark Rebellion 25" and so on.<br/><br/>Moreover, I'll be using <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/11/26/heroquest-hack/" rel="nofollow">an Experience Point Hack</a> that Chris Chinn came up with, where Hero Points are awarded for acting in line with or against five of the clan's core values, and for challenging or affirming any of three relationships a Player builds for his Character during character creation. <br/><br/>The nature of these values and the tensions that can be found in the relationships are all available because of the detailed setting and culture. We have some base assumptions -- that might not be our own personal  base assumptions -- of what a good life is, how one conducts himself or herself for the good of others.<br/><br/>Which is all to say that though we have a very detailed setting (with maps!) we're going all premise on the material. I'll be pushing for the Players to find, in this stew of material, what issues or ideas matter most to them, and have them build in Kickers (per <i>Sorcerer</i>) and then we'll just rock out and see where the play leads us.<br/><br/>But, per a recent thread, not rushing.<br/><br/>But I've already encouraged them to write their own myths and come in and read them to the group, or bring in things about Glorantha that they find interesting and share them. I want us to <i>sink</i> into the setting. To build out more details. I want us to  really treat it more like a novel than a film or a play, where the details of the setting are just as important as what the characters say and do.<br/><br/>The way I'm focusing it, we're creating a myth set in Glorantha. We're like storytellers rummaging through the myths and settings and we'll see what <i>our</i> version of the rebellion in Sartar looks like, what our version of the <i>Hero Wars</i> turns into. It's no different what storytellers in the past have done with other story and situation-rich settings have done -- whether it be the Greek myths or King Arthur's reign.<br/><br/>As we play, I'll have major events already baked into the timeline go off. I'll have no expectation about which way the Player Characters will jump. The point will be to add more complication and opportunities to make choices about what they'll do to reveal who they are.<br/><br/>We'll see how it goes. I haven't done anything campaign-based for years. And apart from some fun <i>Traveller</i> play, have never set myself up in a really rich detailed setting -- let alone someone else's rich, detailed setting. But we'll see!<br/><br/>But, to be clear, the point of haivng this big detailed setting is for all the situation and premise-rich material on hand. The Players can sift through, find things to grab onto, find <i>more</i> things to grab onto, and so on...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343123/#Comment_343123" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-17T19:07:54+00:00" title="September 17, 2011  7:07PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, that sounds fantastic!<br/><br/>Lots of RPG books have given me settings that were inspiring and fun to read, but very few came loaded with those sorts of opportunities for really messy, grabby issues that you could very easily position your character in the middle of.

If we were playing Penny to out-"cool narration" each other:<br/><br/>1) We'd want to lobby for our choices.  Example:<br/><br/>Abel's character is up, you suggest an option for what could have happened, I don't like it -- I'll probably grimace and shake my head at Abel.  Then Betsy starts a suggestion, and I don't like where she's going either, so I wince at her, hoping I can get her to take it somewhere cooler.  She does, and finishes, and Abel thinks for a second.  I say, "Whoa, Betsy, that was intense!" showing my support for the narration I like, and hoping to influence Abel to not only accept it, but continue on in the direction I like.<br/><br/>If we've discussed that it's supposed to be Abel's decision and it's rude to influence him, then I'll sit on my hands, and hope he chooses Betsy's story, and be disappointed if he chooses yours, and feel a little frustrated about my inability to sway things.<br/><br/>2) We'd favor narrations based on events and color rather than on theme.  Why did I like Betsy's story better than yours?  Not because it was meatier for Abel's character, but because I like the way she brought sickening Cthulhoid horror to a vulnerable family moment better than the way you brought vague unease.  Abel would be making his own choice based on similar criteria; perhaps even "What would happen in a good Lovecraft story now?"<br/><br/>3) We'd apply those standards evenly throughout play: the build-up to the story-choice, the story-choice itself, and the concluding narration would all strive to be moody and Lovecraftian, and would all be appreciated accordingly.  "What did you do?" would remain a natural focus of anticipation, and we'd all want to see whether Abel eats the babies or just menaces them, because we all want to see which will work in this particular tale.  I've decided that eating them is more of a Lovecraftian descent into madness, but who knows, maybe Abel can make the menacing work out even better!<br/><br/>4) Pregame talk would, or at least should, be about tone, in addition to the usual.<br/><br/>5) Post-game talk would be about colorful moments and story turning-points.  The owner of the most pennies would get an extra "well-done" nod, maybe, or maybe not as we don't want to make anyone feel like a loser.<br/><br/>That's the vision that pops into my head.

I continue to think the specific socio-textual* prompts make such an instance of play unlikely.<br/><br/>Although JD's example makes it clear that it can happen.  Maybe it's only unlikely with people whose "natural" preference is Narr?  (That's certainly true for 2 out of the 4 of us who played Penny together, and increasingly true for you and for Abel, I think.)<br/><br/>*Hah!

I'm not sure we didn't do what I just described, though.  For my numbered points above:<br/><br/>1) I know there was communication around the table about which "what you did then" prompts people liked best.  I did a fair amount of head-nodding and "ooh, yeah" and "oh, that's cooler than what I came up with!"<br/><br/>2) I can't read anyone's mind.  I know I rooted against some ideas because they struck me as tonally off, and rooted for others because they took the story in a direction I found affecting, aesthetically.  I <i>think</i> I observed Abel doing the same.  Most of his "what you did then" suggestions didn't suggest premise to me, and that was true for some of Betsy's as well.  I think my own suggestions were half and half -- I tried to say things about the character's humanity, 50% because that was personally interesting to me, and 50% because it was cool or gross or a striking visual.<br/><br/>3) There wasn't a whole lot of meta chat, and I don't have a perfect memory for whose eyes lit up when, but there's nothing that makes me say, "No, that wasn't my experience."  The above account is at least plausible for what we did.<br/><br/>4) We didn't discuss tone much.  A little, though.  I got the sense that all of us were on close enough to the same page that we were happy to let the precise niche evolve in play.<br/><br/>5) This was exactly what happened.  I had a lead in pennies for a while and was proud of the cool supernatural overcast I was bringing.  You caught up with some great scenes about graveyards and lights going out and more stuff I can't remember.  Betsy was hit-and-miss; some brilliant, some flat.  Abel was more into his character than pushing ours, and got the fewest pennies.  Afterward, when I said "good game!" to you and Abel, I was thinking, "Matt, good what-then inputs; Abel, good portrayal of your character going evil".<br/><br/>This is why it is easy for me to imagine that we were playing Right to Dream.<br/><br/>Now, I am happy to accept that different players may have had vastly different internal experiences of play.  Maybe, for example, I did what I usually do and geeked out over experiential qualities, while you zeroed in on challenging/revealing character moments, and we saw everything that happened through different lenses.<br/><br/>If so, it didn't seem to matter.  I mean, this didn't feel like some lucky session where we took turns getting what we wanted in some awkward juggling act.  It felt natural and easy and sustainable.  It felt like we were all pulling on the same rope -- the amount of time that anyone wasted on something that someone else did not care about was very, very low.<br/><br/>Accordingly, my best guess is that we had a firing CA.  <br/><br/>And, if I was forced to lump it into either G or N or S, I'd pick N.  <br/><br/>But I <i>don't</i> have to pick!  I don't see a good reason to.  I see some use in viewing our social event through <i>both</i> angles -- we were there to address premise; we were there to dream -- <i>and</i> through the <i>combined</i> angle: we were there to address premise <i>and</i> to dream.  I really don't see where the limitation of "pick one or the other, you can't have both" gets us here.<br/><br/>In most fields of complicated phenomena like human interaction, it seems to me that classification is best understood as utilitarian approximation; real life does not, in fact, fit neatly into a convenient number of categories.  GNS is descriptive, and describing all roleplaying as 3 basic activities is only that simple if we (rather artificially) force it to be.<br/><br/>Clearly plenty of people think and talk about RPGs just fine without GNS.  Others use GNS to good effect.  From the games I've played in, my inclination is to keep the baby (insights about G and N and S) but throw out the bath water ("there can be only one").<br/><br/>It's just what makes sense to me.  Whether it'll make me a better player, GM, conversationalist or game-designer remains to be seen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343156/#Comment_343156" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-18T07:47:46+00:00" title="September 18, 2011  7:47AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some fine insights, but I still think you're focusing way too much on individual moments for G/N/S to be a useful lens for you to examine what you want to examine.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343410/#Comment_343410" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T13:58:23+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  1:58PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2011 2:05PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the best I got from my GNS diagnostic chats with Ron was, "Well, Dave, from this collection of individual moments I see these patterns of priority which I'll guess mean this CA was in action."  <br/><br/>That's what I've attempted to do here -- to communicate my take on the larger dynamics in play by relating it to concrete things that happened at the table.  Yeah, those connections are messy, but sticking with <i>just</i> general observations -- "I think we collectively gave social rewards in equal measure to addressing both premise and idiom" -- sounds like pure opinion to me.  I like to at least <i>try</i> to be empirical about this.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As for what I want to examine, that includes the social dynamics at the table regarding the game.  I think G and N and S all can contribute to that examination, as general starting points of "stuff to consider".  Like, premise and theme are one thing I can look for when examining how players work together with each other and the system.  So is challenge.  As for Sim, I've found it useful at times to think about source material and constructive denial.<br/><br/>Other lenses give other stuff to consider.  GNS isn't my top go-to -- it may not even be in the top 10 anymore -- but I think it deserves a spot in the grab-bag.  <br/><br/>...and for some reason it's compelling to chat about.  I know you and I have done it several times.  Maybe we're just brain-damaged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15064/g-n-s-idle-thought/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15064/g-n-s-idle-thought">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15064/g-n-s-idle-thought/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15064/g-n-s-idle-thought/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15064/g-n-s-idle-thought/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15064%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15064%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
