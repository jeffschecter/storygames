Hope it's interesting for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Saturday night, at about 3 AM, we wrapped up our epic RQ III campaign <i>The Gates of Karshit</i> with a complete success for the player characters. In the words of one of my players:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">"Ancient gods intervened, cannibal priests were smashed, Pegasus helped us, the King of Satyrs got himself out of debt, an Evil Temple crumpled down and was destroyed, a Chaotic goddess was kicked back to the Abyss she should have never left, a father saw his daughter die after meeting her again, the undead corpse of Agammenon was defeated (his specter was beaten some time ago), and 4 PCs got their souls back. An epic final ending if there was one</div>\n</blockquote>\n"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to that I add that I got to make Ningauble of the 7 Eyes (from Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd &amp; Grey Mouser's saga) show up and make a deal with the PCs, I saw how sticking to the dice made the endig more awesome than we could possibly imagine (as examples I could cite Agammenon's early defeat due to an special success which pushed him to the Abyss whe he was about to kill one of the PCs, or the sad death of a beloved NPC who has just redeemed herself and died anyway). And I got to pitch them (through Ningauble's magic cave that allows for planar travelling) the follow - up of the campaign, which them accepted in full:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Griffind Island</i>, there we go.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom there, the discussion derived into a very interesting debate about letting dice fall where they may, and letting random chance fucking up your plans and expectations. So, I would love to hear some opinions from the community around here. Or answer any questions, Whatever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260635/#Comment_260635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T02:19:54+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  2:19AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It starts with...<br><br>"Ancient Gods Intervened..."<br><br>...the sounds like the worst kind of deprotagonisation to me...which in the scheme of things is pretty anti-climactic.

Allow me to clarify it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "ancient gods intervened" refers to a successful Divine Intervention roll on behalf of one of the PCs, that allowed them to get the help of Pegasus once more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, when they decided to storm the Big Bad Evil Temple of Badness, they knew (because they had with them an ex acolyte of such temple) that the area of the Heart had a powerful magic defense and mighty guardians. As they had recruited previously the help of Pegasus in a previous game (when they travelled throug time to Ancient Mycens, 2000 years before), they thought, "Hey, the magic protection covers the grounds around the Temple, but not the Temple itself. Why don't we assault the Temple through its roof?" So, Pegasus help was needed at the players' request, it was their idea. They rolled for a Divine Intervention (a pagan character did, actually) and Zeus granted them the chance to call on Pegassus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Big Bad Evil Goddess is, as any god in RQ, part of the scenery, not an actor with an agenda. She was sending her evil power through the rift, looking for an anchor in the world. But she didn't take any decissive action. It was all PCs and NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Many typos, think I got them all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260653/#Comment_260653" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T07:39:16+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  7:39AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like an awesome ending to a campaign!

Don't ask me what the difficulty on that roll is! And the Enmity clause is not your friend in that situation! <br><br>I'm a fan of letting the dice fall where they may as long as I prequalify. I don't like to roll if I don't think either result will be entertaining for everyone. And if I'm not sure, I will ask. We were in such a situation last Thursday!<br><br>Thor is running Mouse Guard and in the previous game Thor said Kevin Allen Jr's PC's father would help me only if I promise to try to convince Kevin's PC to quit the Mouse Guard. I agreed! After all, he nearly died the session before after being swallowed by a wolverine and left for dead! <br><br>So we complete our mission, start the Player Turn, I look to everyone and say I want to convince Kevin to quit! But I really didn't! But I did! I thought it would be dramatic but I didn't want to have his character removed from the game because of a roll I made. I asked Kevin if he was cool with it, otherwise I would find another way to do it. Kevin was down! But I still was hesitant. I tried to weasel the roll in Kevin's favor by asking if I can use a trait against myself to give Kevin bonus dice. But you can't in the Player Turn! There was no escape! I rolled my 3 dice...<br/><br/>3 ones! <br/><br/>Wow! The dice sent us a clear message... no!<br/><br/>That was also one of the most fun games I\u2019ve played in a while!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260710/#Comment_260710" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T11:28:47+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 11:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony: well, I thought that really my explanation could have not been clear enough, and the question is legit. The tone may be a bit harsh, but as I'm not a native English speaker I tend to use the most charitable reading when I first deal with someone. So no offence for me. Thanks for the kind words <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nJenskot: that story rocked, indeed. I'm not familiar with Mouse Guard, though I have run BW a few times, so I may not be getting everything straight. What I get is that you were really commited to that roll, and letting the dice fall where they may enhanced the sense of suspense and wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why I stopped fudging dice rolls and started making rolls in the open some years ago. Never looked back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, somehow, raises to me the following question. I dearly love RQ III. I dearly love Pendragon. I remember that there was this modified character sheet in the Genertela sourcebook that included some of the personality mechanics from Pendragon. How could they be implemented in a game like RQ? How would they impact a game oriented to strong simulation of a gritty setting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
