The crown achieves this effect, when worn, by drawing in arcane energy from its surroundings. In doing so, it becomes a sort of spell magnet. Spells targeted within 3*(wearer's caster level) feet of the crown deviate from their target to affect the wearer of the crown, instead. Spells targeted within 6*(wearer's caster level) feet of the crown deviate to a point halfway between the wearer and the initial target. Spells targeted within 9*(wearer's caster level) feet of the crown deviate to a point one quarter of the way from the intended target to the wearer, in the direction of the wearer. Finally, spells targeted more than 9*(wearer's caster level) away from the crown are unaffected. Once the pattern is sussed out, a successful spellcraft check (DC at GM's discretion) may allow a caster to determine the proper location to target her spell such that it hits the desired location between the target point and the crown.<br/><hr/><br/>Silly name, I know, but I was feeling uncreative at the time.<br/>There are some <i>really</i> great items here.

A cleric who channels positive energy can spend turning attempts to enhance Maxwell's enchantment. The first turn attempt spent adds the Holy descriptor; each turn attempt spent after that adds +1 to the enchantment, to a maximum of +4. The effect lasts for one minute per caster level.<br/><br/>Maxwell bonds via Lesser Telepathic Bond with anyone who picks him up and retains possession of him for more than two minutes.The bond lasts until the bearer's death. Once bonded the bearer gains proficiency with warhammer, and Maxwell can see, hear, smell, etc. through his bearer. In addition, he knows their alignment. He will lie to any evil character to the point of leading them to death so he can be picked up by some other character. The owner can not leave Maxwell behind. Should they be separated by more than 50 feet, Maxwell automatically dimension doors into the bearer's personal effects, or hand, if no pack is carried.<br/><br/>Maxwell is deathly afraid of undead, and will scream audibly and uncontrollably when confronted with them. Until he calms down, he can not be dropped, and the bearer must make a DC 25 grapple check to remove Maxwell from his hand. In addition, the bearer must make a successful Will save against Maxwell's Will save (base 11) or suffer a -5 penalty to hit.<br/><br/>Maxwell's stats are Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 16. He is a cheerful, optimistic, and chatty fellow, despite his long centuries of life as a hammer. He will often cheer his bearer on in whatever endeavor is pursued, especially those of a more amorous nature.<br/><br/>Maxwell was a rather ineffective street urchin turned rogue who broke into the wrong temple. Local priests were looking to make a powerful weapon to combat the threat of a local lycanthrope war. They convinced Maxwell that they wouldn't turn him in to the authorities if he would participate in their ritual. They also promised him immortality and several pounds of silver. Scared of death, and none too bright, Maxwell agreed and his soul was bound within the hammer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330103/#Comment_330103" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T18:20:20+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  6:20PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Honey Pot</b><br/><br/>This small earthenware pot is worked with a pattern that vaguely resembles flying bees.

Once they had mastered the various native blades of their homeland\u2014which debating military historians have variously attested to be modern-day Germany, Italy, Nigeria, Syria, Spain, India, Mexico, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, China, Puerto Rico, and/or (oddly enough) the Bronx\u2014exponents of this school made a morbid game of traveling to exotic foreign lands, barging into local martial arts schools, inflicting violence on the grey and unsuspecting masters in residence, and returning home weighed down with sharpened souvenirs of their maraudery. A clique of popular students at the school in question, who dabbled in the fashionable alchemies of the time, began to forge/commission/steal (again, depends whom you ask) swords which, at a subtle mental or neural impulse from the swordsman, reshape themselves into any conceivable construction of hilt and blade, from shin gunt\u014d to macahuitl, with the fluidity of vinegar running down the slopes of a salad. The most elaborate examples of this bloodthirsty artifice, either through their own awesome construction or their wielders' smug sense of superiority, indistinguishably mimic named weapons of great fame: the Green Destiny, Durandal, Dh\u016b l-Fiq\u0101r, and their ilk.<br/><br/>Depending on what game you happen to be enjoying at the time, a morph sword may have elaborately detailed tables of alphanumeric statistics spanning the full range of different swords (but only swords!) the sourcebooks lovingly detail, or it may be, y'know, wetwork omnisword quicksilver. Universally, the morph sword's functional benefit is to afford its wielder's player the obnoxious freedom to choose at each individual step of action resolution the properties of whichever sword of the morph sword's particular power level (mundane, superior, Artifact \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022, whatever) its inevitably statistically overeducated player wishes. Position with a zweihander and wound with a chainsword? If you can find the stats, an it harm one, do as thou wilt.<br/><br/>Collectors estimate individual morph swords' values over a wide and appropriately unpredictable range. Their originators cannot be reached for comment, as the entire school accepted a challenge from an obscure academy of Hawai'ian martial artists, who showed up at the m\xeal\xe9e with cheap wooden longspears and slaughtered the morph swordsmen to a man at range with little effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330496/#Comment_330496" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T15:51:37+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  3:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2011 3:56PM by ccreitz.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clothing woven from <b>dire spidersilk</b> has the elegant drape, smooth hand, and superior comfort of silk, but the durability of fine steel and the stain-resistance of glass.

However, it is impossible to read the book without reading it from start to finish - If you try to open the book on a random page, all the letters jumble together and form lewd images of the reader. The only way to read the book and uncover anything is to start from page 1. If the reader falls asleep he/she has to start from the top. The book is so long and dense it'll take several lifetimes to complete, and the first 30 years of reading details the life of Eric, a beet farmer who never experienced anything apart from exceptionally dull things, in excruciating detail. The next 30 years are rumored to be about the quasi-political society of the Hedge Stork, a large and thoroughly extinct bird, in which the author gives the storks names and gets upset if the reader forgets who's who of Hedge Stork society.<br/><br/>What follows is a direct quote from the Book of Hours, page 1: <br/><br/>"Eric opened his left eye with slight problems as his eye lashes were stuck together. Eric did not know what had made his eye lashes stick together, but research has shown that most likely it is due to moisture. Eric opened his right eye without any issues or concerns, although he should keep general eye health in mind".... <br/><br/><br/>page 29: <br/><br/>"Eric could not find his socks, so he contemplated walking barefoot through the house, but decided against it. It was 1,4 minutes since he woke up and did not feel up to the task of walking barefoot so soon after waking on this day. He lifted his head and looked at the closed bedroom door. It was still closed, and he knew he had to open it in order to exit the room.

Some theologists claim it is the fossilized blood of the Gods That Were. Some scholars theorize it is the legacy of a long forgotten powerful alchemist. Whatever its origin, its power is starting to become stuff of legend.<br/><br/>In its "natural" state, <i>Icor</i> resembles an opaque, heavy and dark-red or brown colored mineral. When properly treated (with a mixture of some arcane chemicals and some willingly sacrificed blood) and heated to an almost unmanageable temperature, it becomes a metallic liquid similar to quicksilver (only red). <i>Icor</i> then remains in its liquid state up until it suffers a considerably swift temperature decrease (most of the time by magical means). After it has cooled down, it takes on characteristics of a red colored metal.<br/><br/>This ore cannot be alloyed with any other substance (not even by magical means). In fact, the outcome of any such mixture will invariable become worthless slug.<br/><br/>Its most common usage is in decorative and functional metal gear, but the most priced <i>Icor</i> artifacts are, unsurprisingly, weapons and sets of armor.<br/><br/><i>Icor</i> items have a very powerful latent magic. If the user participates in a long and painstaking ritual involving willingly sacrificing some of his own blood and a very long introspective meditation, the item permanently bonds with the user and its magical properties manifest. (The bond is retained even after death.)<br/><br/>The first and most obvious manifestation is a change of shape. The item takes on physical characteristics of the user's unconscious self-image (famous artifacts include a stylized and frightening thorned bodice worn by a very brave and very defensive warrior-princess, a demonic looking set of plate-mail belonging to a sadistic general and a simple but beautiful crown worn by a very pious king). Unknown to most but the closest associates to a true user, the shape is not permanent, and changes along with the user's self-image and values. If the user matures, improves and learns from his mistakes, the item grows more beautiful, magnificent and mighty. On the other hand, if the user corrupts, looses himself and becomes dependent on anything or anyone, the item becomes twisted, dull and fragile.<br/><br/>It is theorized that one observant person might keep track of the user's inner journey of self-discovery and personal growth. The more beautiful it looks and powerful it is, the better adjusted and mightier the user actually is. (It should be noted this effect is completely independent of the user's morality and ethic views.)<br/><br/>A second and handy property of <i>Icor</i> items is the fact that they repair by themselves, in a process close to living beings healing. Given enough time, any <i>Icor</i> item will return to its original undamaged state.<br/><br/>A third and less known manifestation of the magic in an <i>Icor</i> artifact is a lot subtler. With time, the item will loose its shine and become a dark red or brown color. If the item is spilled with any quantity of blood, the item will seem to absorb it and recover its initial shine and rich crimson color. (The bigger the quantity of blood it "drinks", the longer the time it retains its shine.)<br/><br/>Any <i>Icor</i> item (even an unbounded one) radiates a very powerful but unidentifiable magical aura.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330867/#Comment_330867" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T15:04:22+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  3:04PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>The<b>Carpet of Frying</b>appears to be an ordinary, if exceptionally well-made, carpet.

Within the frame holds a smooth, flat piece of rose-colored glass with a single crack through it's length. It has the following effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the owner looks through the glass at a person during a conversation, if the person is lying, the movement of his mouth will not sync with his audible voice. The bigger the lie, the less his mouth will visibly sync with his voice. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis unique, mouth-out-of-sync effect will additionally occur to the owner of the locket when the owner speaks lies. This effect will be visible to everyone around him. This effect will occur to the owner even when the locket "is not activated" by peering through it; the owner merely needs to have possession of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, when the owner looks through the glass at a person, or a group of people, all people who will stand with that person in a time of need in the future OR will conspire to turn against the owner in a time of consequence in the future will be surrounded by a white aura. The greater the need or consequence, the brighter the aura. The locket does not make it clear if a person will be trustworthy or a backstabber...it will only alert the owner of the "strength" of importance in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14493/the-kick-ass-treasure-thread" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14493/the-kick-ass-treasure-thread" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14493/the-kick-ass-treasure-thread/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14493%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14493%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
