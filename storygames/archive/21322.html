There are three categories of harm, in increasing order of gravity.<br/><br/><b>Nasty</b> harm means painful bruises and superficial lacerations:<br/>Thrashed!\tYou look and feel like a mess: bloody, bruised and teared up<br/>Jolted!\t\tYou lose grip on something important you\u2019re holding, carrying or wearing<br/>Downed!\tYou lose your footing or position<br/>Impaired!\tYou are hindered/stunned/pinned by something you can\u2019t ignore<br/>Knocked Out!\tYou are unconscious, incoherent, unable to act<br/><br/><b>Serious</b> harm means broken bones and deep wounds:<br/>Scarred!\tWhatever hit you is gonna leave a lasting mark<br/>Crippled!\tA wound is so painful that you must Defy it to perform any action requiring effort or strain<br/>Maimed!\tOne or more of your limbs is broken or mauled and is now inoperable<br/>Shocked!\tYou are unable to either see or hear; you might need to Defy your stunted perceptions to act<br/><br/><b>Deadly</b> harm means critical and extensive damage:<br/>Wounded!\tYour condition is bad and will develop complications; you will die within a few days<br/>Bleeding!\tYour condition deteriorates rapidly; you will die within a few hours<br/>Goner!\t\tYour heart stops beating; you are dead or will die in a matter of seconds<br/><br/>Whenever harm is suffered by a character their Player chooses one effect from the appropriate category, plus one from each lighter category. This selection always starts from the lighter category. If needed, the Player describes any details that might be required to enrich or clarify the situation.\n<blockquote>Ex.. a character suffers Serious harm so their Player has to pick one effect from the Nasty category and then one effect from the Serious category.</blockquote>\nEach effect can only be selected once in the same scene, and only if the fictional circumstances allow it; if it is not possible to select an appropriate effect then it gets bumped up one category. A Player can always elect to suffer a harm effect from a more grievous category in place of one from a lighter one.\n<blockquote>Ex.. a character is crawling on the floor in order to sneak past a guard post, but a flying gargoyle attacks them by surprise landing a swooping claw slash from above, hit and run style, inflicting Nasty harm. But...<br/>The character has been already Thrashed by a previous encounter.<br/>Being on the ground they can\u2019t really be Downed.<br/>It so happens that they have nothing that could be Jolted out of their hands or body.<br/>The gargoyle attack was described so that it doesn\u2019t make sense for it to Impair them.<br/>The only option left is to be Knocked Out, but the Player doesn\u2019t want that to happen and instead chooses to upgrade the harm to Serious.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466914/#Comment_466914" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-10T11:23:39+00:00" title="October 10, 2017 11:23AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HARM ADJUDICATION</span></b><br/>Harm is not absolute. There is no list of values that can tell you that a sword always inflicts X amount of Harm. Instead Harm is relative to the fiction and its circumstances. This means that a multitude of factors could be important:<br/>- the size, weight, shape and quality of the attack weapon<br/>- the style, speed and skill of the attack action<br/>- how vital (literally) is the specific area being targeted<br/>- then again all the above considerations but this time for armor and defence<br/>- then any environmental circumstance that could be relevant<br/>- and finally correlate and compare it all to have a general picture of the situation<br/><br/>Instead of painstakingly crunching each detail into numbers, this game relies on the GM (and the Players) to simply looking at the fiction as a whole to make a broad eyeball judgement answering a single question: all things considered is this harm Nasty, Serious or outright Deadly?<br/>Most of the time the answer will be obvious, but in case of doubt looking at the TAGs relevant to the situation can be of help, just like reviewing what each Harm level actually represents, and its practical list of effects. In the rare cases when there is no clear and unanimous evaluation, the GM acts as final arbiter and tiebreaker.\n<blockquote>Es.. A drunkard lazily swinging a fork is a pretty tame threat, while a skilled assassin driving that same fork into an unprotected area can easily be deadly.<br/>A punch from a human can be bad, but a punch from a gorilla can be dangerous, and a punch from a giant should just make you go \u201csquish\u201d.<br/>A sting from a wasp won\u2019t even trigger the Harm mechanics, but ending up in the middle of a swarm of angry wasps could be Nasty and then degenerate to Serious or even Deadly.<br/></blockquote>\nAn important detail to notice is that Nasty is not the least Harm possible. No Harm is the least amount possible, and there might be plenty of situations when an attack would simply not be able to inflict any Harm.\n<blockquote>Es.. A human knight swinging a broadsword at an unarmored peasant might cause Deadly Harm.<br/>Doing the same against a tree-man made of solid living wood might cause Nasty Harm at best.<br/>And no Harm at all will befall a stone golem, as the sword would barely scratch its rocky skin, no matter how much martial proficiency the knight can put into the swings.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466915/#Comment_466915" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-10T11:25:02+00:00" title="October 10, 2017 11:25AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HARDINESS &amp; HEALING</span></b><br/>Hardiness Points (HP) represent a character\u2019s proclivity to survive harm either through skill, expertise, resilience or sheer luck. They can be spent when harm is suffered before any effect is selected to lower the overall harm category on a one by one basis.\n<blockquote>Ex.. a character is badly wounded and should face Deadly harm. By spending one HP the character somehow turns it into Serious harm. By spending a second HP they can reduce the harm to just Nasty level. A third HP will allow them to avoid any and all harm.</blockquote>\nWhen harm is reduced or averted in this fashion the Player could and should describe how this effect looks like in the fiction. Is the character parrying or dodging? Or doing something else to take the edge off the Harm suffered? Doing so enriches the game experience adding more detail to the action, but is not a strict requirement.<br/><br/>Hardiness is not a specific measurement of a character\u2019s ability of some kind; it is instead a pure amount of \u201cdramatic protection\u201d. You are a protagonist within an adventurous story and are expected to have a slightly better chance at survival than just anyone else.<br/><br/>Once harm is suffered its permanence and eventual healing depend on the fictional circumstances and the gravity of the harm suffered. Left unattended, harm can worsen and lead to more harm.<br/><br/>Nasty harm is meant to be circumstantial and transient. It doesn\u2019t get worse over time, and a good rest will make it all go away. Most effects can even be removed by simply describing a PC performing an appropriate action such as \u201cstanding up\u201d after they have been Downed. This becomes relevant in dangerous and hectic situation where doing many things at once could trigger a move. Standing up and avoiding enemy blows is a perfect example.<br/><br/>Serious harm can degenerate badly representing a golden opportunity for the GM to perform Hard Moves, even inflicting the Deadly class Wounded effect if proper care is not provided in a timely fashion. The healing of Serious harm requires dedicated medical attention in the form of time, effort, skill and supplies. Serious harm has three stages of healing: first Dressed, then Treated, then Mended, then it is finally gone and can be removed from the character sheet. Every time a move applies healing to a Serious effect, it improves by one degree.<br/><br/>Deadly harm left untreated leads to the end of a character\u2019s life, where the exact amount of time left is in the GM\u2019s hands. Being able to perform healing on a Goner character is very unlikely, but in a world full of magic nothing should be considered impossible; this turns them into Bleeding. Further healing turns them into Wounded. Further healing transforms the Deadly effect into a Serious one of the Player\u2019s choice. If any of these steps is not possible because an effects is already present, than the healing can\u2019t proceed until the other harm is taken care of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466918/#Comment_466918" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-10T14:10:56+00:00" title="October 10, 2017  2:10PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Immediate two thoughts.<br/><br/>1.

Should be up to the fiction what harm I end up at after being magically healed from Goner rather than needing to have 3 separate actions. "The God of Light heals you!

I like it, overall.<br/><br/>I agree with some of the comments that the "follow the fiction" elements of the rules might sometimes clash with the procedural parts. Only being able to choose an outcome once per scene, for example, could feel arbitrary sometimes, and healing sounds rather mechanical in nature (though I really like the "stages"; that's something I haven't seen in game design a whole lot, and it has potential).<br/><br/>The very deterministic nature of the rules is interesting (for example, any target can take exactly three Deadly hits before dying, right?).

Or you end up Defying the difficulty of doing both things at the same time.<br/>The "pile up" mechanic gives more importance to your PC's positioning... regaining an advantageous position or taking a moment to shake off dizziness become actions of great value.\n<blockquote>I'm also somewhat curious what sort of game this subsystem is for.

I've been working on something similar for the negotiation and adjudication of the fiction, but ended going for the Spicy Roll for half of the process, as discussing all and each of the possible fictional variables could take much of the valuable time that we're trying to save by taking away crunchy distractions in the system. <br/><br/>That's not to say that there won't be negotiation or even that whoever put the challenge can't give suggestions or ask questions to the other players to get more precise info (like "How exactly do you do that?" or "What do you have that can stand fire damage?") but that after a couple questions and some negotiation, if there's some small disagreement, something isn't obvious or if nobody's got more ideas, we can cut to the roll and then use it to inform the fiction about other variables involved. But that just works for my group, it would most probably feel like bad practice in other groups.<br/><br/>Besides that, here's an idea for healing in middle combat, either if it's magic or not: you mention that PCs can't take more than 3 deadly hits. What if this healing takes away the conditions (if it fits the fiction) but doesn't reset the hits threshold back to zero? Meaning that if a PC is wounded deadly twice and then healed, the conditions are either reduced by one category or eliminated depending on the treatment, but a single deadly attack after that kills the PC the same, as if he's not really completely healed.

Left unattended, harm can worsen and lead to more harm.<br/><br/>Nasty harm is meant to be circumstantial and transient. It doesn\u2019t get worse over time, and a good rest will make it all go away. Nasty effects can be unmarked by simply describing a PC performing an appropriate action. This is relevant in dangerous and hectic situation where doing more than one thing at the same time could trigger a move, such as Defy Danger.<br/><br/>Serious harm can degenerate badly, representing a golden opportunity for the GM to perform Hard Moves, including the infliction Deadly effects if proper care is not provided in a timely fashion. The healing of Serious harm requires dedicated medical attention in the form of time, effort, skill and supplies.<br/><br/>Deadly harm left untreated leads to the end of a character\u2019s life, where the exact moment of death is left in the GM\u2019s hands within the confines set by the worse Deadly effect suffered by the character.<br/><br/>While in the heat of the moment it is often possible to come up with clever emergency solutions to somehow get around functional problems caused by Harm, there are only two ways to unmark Harm effects: prolonged downtime or moves.<br/><br/>In the case of prolonged downtime the GM freely determines if Harm can be unmarked. One or more weeks of rest and recuperation being properly fed and treated should have a good impact on a character\u2019s health, even granting full rehabilitation if magic is involved.<br/><br/>In the case of Moves, such as Make Camp or some Spells, healing is handled as an abstract unit representing the application of time, effort, skill and materials. To this end:<br/>- no Healing is required to unmark Nasty effects, as previously mentioned<br/>- three Healings are required to unmark one Serious effect; receiving just one or two healings means that the wound is dressed and treated, improving its fictional positioning, but the Harm effect is still marked<br/>- one Healing is enough to unmark a Deadly effect, but it must be the most grievous one</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
