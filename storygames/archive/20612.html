I love how fluid and engaging it feels; it has never failed to firestart the session. Lately I've been thinking on how to give players the chance to link one of the answers to the background of their characters, thus making them even more important for the setting. I think that definitely players will have to roll a dice to define if that relationship is positive or negative (which doesn't really imposes a bonus or penalty of any kind for their characters, but helps define their background better.<br/><br/>Also, I'm still using my <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow">Resourceful deck</a> to improvise and help the players improvise players, items, npcs and traps. On top of that I'd like to implement a mechanic that allows players to introduce rumors in-game, in taverns or similar places, to signal me what kind of things interest their characters right now. A perception roll still helps me define how exact or complete the information is, but otherwise I'm still following the players instead of leading them anywhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
