How do you think that has effected play?

It is more focused than the ones in the book but I am always surprised anyway. My most recent play didn't have the HOA involved at all, it was a crazy feud between two neighbors over ownership of a shed. There's also a strong thread in that playset implying some kind of weird outsiders/cultists/alien invaders but I've never seen that become what a session was about.<br/><br/>When I play with strangers I usually bring three playsets I am excited about and haven't played lately and let the table pick. When I play with friends it is usually a new playset that needs some kicking around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404957/#Comment_404957" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T13:02:22+00:00" title="January 29, 2013  1:02PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played it, but at a con back in November, the table next to me was playing my copy while I was playing Durance. I heard bits and pieces and got some more info once we were all done. Theirs ended up involving a portal to another dimension (I am thinking more Lovecraft-ian than Tolkein-ian). As Jason notes, the playset lends itself to issues of "others" invading your community, but it's really up to the games' players to decide who those "others" are and if they are indeed a legitimate threat.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
