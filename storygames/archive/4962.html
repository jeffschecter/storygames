My primary experience is via the Hercules &amp; Xena (H&amp;X) game which was the first role-playing game I ran for my wife.  We and our friends had a great time and I believe the success of that campaign contributed greatly to her continuing in participating in the hobby with me.  Prior to that, I had played a small amount of D6 Star Wars.<br/><br/>My understanding is that the H&amp;X game was actually D6 Legend (or d6 lite), so that may color my impressions - I really didn't play enough of D6 Star Wars to make a judgement there.<br/><br/>Things I liked:<br/>* Though H&amp;X came with custom dice, the game could be played with standard six-siders (available almost anywhere).  This made it very accessible and minimized the "what die do I roll now" factor.<br/>* As I recall, the same basic mechanic handled all conflict resolution - which made it very easy for me to, on-the-fly, improvise rulings and to incorporate magic when the one of players decided she wanted to be a priestess of Hecate.<br/>* Advancement felt pretty quick and easy, allowing the PCs to more or less improve one thing per session but without causing an overly quick ramp up in power level. <br/><br/>What did others like about West End Games D6 system?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111405/#Comment_111405" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T14:08:13+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  2:08PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blue</cite>So, rumor has it (there is apparantly a notice on thier site, but I can't access it from work) that West End Games is making their D6 system FREE.</blockquote>\nHere's the announcement:\n<blockquote><cite>WEG website</cite><br/>I have some stuff to put in place before I can release an official press release to the effect, but I thought I'd let everyone here know what I have planned for D6.<br/><br/>Shortly, I'm going to be releasing the D6 System license for free. Although in the past it was effectively free, there was still some confusing aspect to the license which prevented publisher from understanding the cost and reimbursement aspects of the license. That is all changing. The D6 will be totally free to use for commercial and non-commercial purposes, and without restriction. It is not going to be released under the OGL per se, but anyone wishing to use the license will be able to do so but filling out a form on the website.<br/><br/>I'll also be releasing an SRD so that players can get the basics of the system for free. I'm hoping this will help turn players on to the D6 System and increase the player base.<br/>__________________<br/>Eric Gibson<br/>Publisher, West End Games/<br/>Purgatory Publishing Inc. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111408/#Comment_111408" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T14:13:30+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  2:13PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stolen straight (and modified) from Wick:<br/><br/>When it's something you really care about, <b>roll d8s</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111423/#Comment_111423" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T15:40:29+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  3:40PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Ron!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111479/#Comment_111479" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T21:36:07+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  9:36PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some ideas:<br/>\n<br/>\nUse the Damage chart for any extended conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nResist damage with whatever seems to fit (KNO for legal battles, PER for most social stuff, TEC for the slicing/hacking).<br/>\n<br/>\nUse refresh scenes to recover.
