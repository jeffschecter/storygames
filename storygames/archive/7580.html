Now that we have the Holy Writ, I find it disconcerting, as I imagine does Gregor, that some people are intepreting his Words. When Gregor writes 'the opportunity to make an assault themselves'. This is what He means. Anyone who reads this differently is surely taking 3:16 in vain. Likewise, failing is failing and rolling is rolling, how could it be any different?<br/><br/>I admit that I too was initial confused on p23 where it says 'take some counters'. What kind of counters did Gregor mean, what shape should they be, what flavour and how warm? For three weeks I wrestled with this question, and then for about five minutes when the shopkeeper demanded payment for said counters. I showed him the Holy Writ of Gregor, in black and white! But he was not moved. I have labelled him unGregor and will picket outside the shop everyday** until he relents.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Brothers and Sisters in Gregor, I ask, nay demand, that you stand strong behind me as the Prophet of the Word of Gregor. If you have any questions as to the meaning of the words, ask me and I shall advise for I have met Gregor and he said this unto me, 'Shteve, a flargle g'mack Scottish Claymores, g'ruff, yeu no wat I mean?'***<br/><br/><br/>*Best Friends is not a proper game (qv Luke Crane)<br/>** Between 5 and 5:15 on my way home from work.<br/>*** He may have had a few bevvies but the meaning is clear.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168262/#Comment_168262" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T09:47:12+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  9:47AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168268/#Comment_168268" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T09:53:19+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  9:53AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168436/#Comment_168436" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T02:39:58+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  2:39AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brother Steve makes many valid points but, ultimately, engages in misinterpretation that could lead to schism*.<br/><br/>What the Word of Gregor <i>actually</i> stated during that vital conversation is: 'Shteve, a flargle g'mack <i>Lance Armstrong</i>, g'ruff, yeu no wat I mean?'. I think that we can all agree that this places a wholly new and much more wide-ranging interpretation on His Words. Brother Steve, sadly, chooses to hear what he wanted to hear** rather than hearing what truly was The Word.<br/><br/>And, if I may conclude with a further piece of vital and true understanding: when His Words refer to 'counters', he was of course alluding to those who count money and their subsequent banishment from the Temple. So much is obvious.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm<br/><br/>*Insomuch as certain elements of the faith may travel of far away lands such as the so called 'New' Zealand.<br/>**He may not actually have wanted to hear it and may have wanted to discuss the Colonial Stick-and-Ball Game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168445/#Comment_168445" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T04:07:52+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  4:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Rabbit* informs me that the reference to "counters" in the Holy Book by His Wordship The Gregorian may in fact refer to the actual counters that the counters in the temple were sitting behind counting.<br/><br/>In that light I only play with secondhand counters from small grocery shops or in rare cases hairdressing salons - it does demand quite a big map to play on, but on the other hand you can roll the dice directly on them, which is handy.<br/><br/>Truly, madly<br/>Per<br/><br/>*Jewish online only advisor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168446/#Comment_168446" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T04:12:36+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  4:12AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh.
