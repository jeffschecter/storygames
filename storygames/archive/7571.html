The final product is going to be made up of a calendar and a separate booklet.<br/><br/>Each month of the calendar covers a particular section of the Snow Queen's palace, with the picture for that month being a map of that part of the palace with little numbers indicating how Gerda (the protagonist) progresses through the "dungeon" over the course of the days of that month.  I may do these maps myself or I might try to get somebody like Tony Dowler to do them, because he rocks.<br/><br/>Each numbered day on the calendar corresponds to a short, paragraph-long entry in the booklet, describing the challenges Gerda faces in that room or area of the palace.  For example:<br/><br/><i><b>Nov 23, All Along the Watchtower:</b> Having reached the towering spires and parapets where the Snow Queen's owl police nest, Gerda must recruit the aid of a sympathetic owl and fly to the main central tower where the Queen has kept Kay imprisoned.  The other owls will presumably attempt to prevent this.  Determine how Gerda escapes from them and is eventually dropped on the highest point of the Queen's palace, the central tower roof.</i><br/><br/>The intention is for an adult or adults to use the paragraphs in the booklet to structure a long-form bedtime story for kids that takes place over the 6 months from October to March, the coldest half of the year.  The telling of the story can either be solo'd by the adult(s) or concocted collaboratively with the kids, depending on individual play preferences and, at the end of each night's piece of the story, Gerda's accomplishments are written onto that day's square on the calendar, providing a record of her journey to save Kay from the Snow Queen, acquiring magic items and friends along the way.  If folks need to skip some days and make them up later, that should be totally fine.  I realize people's schedules can be pretty crazy these days.<br/><br/>So far, I'm thinking of a week-based meta-structure which goes like this:<br/><br/>- Area A: 7 days<br/>- Area B: 7 days<br/>- Miniboss Fight: 1 day<br/>- Area C: 7 days<br/>- Area <img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> 7 days<br/>- Boss Fight: 1 day<br/><br/>= 30 days, tweaked for months with different numbers of days<br/><br/>Generally, as in Zelda, Gerda gains a new magic item in every "dungeon" (every month) and recovers one major shard of the Troll's Mirror from a person, animal, or spirit that has been corrupted by it.  About halfway through (maybe on New Year's?) she succeeds in finding and freeing Kay and then they have to make their way out of the palace together.<br/><br/>My main question is two-fold:<br/><br/>1. Would you play something like this with your kids?  Or, for people without kids, with your partner / spouse / etc?<br/><br/>2. How does this structure sound?  Does it give you enough information to go on that you could fill in the rest?<br/><br/>I imagining that each daily piece of the story probably lasts an hour at most in the telling.  I want to provide enough details that it's easy to improvise stuff off of it, but not so much that I'm effectively "GMing" by proxy, though the booklet.  I want people to be able to take the paragraph for a given day and decide that the owl police chief is named Skutterwing and he's been mercilessly hounding the youngest owl, Puffer, who doesn't really want to be a police owl, but her father was a great hero of the force and expects her to do the same.  And then have Gerda sneak up to Puffer while the owls are sleeping and try to recruit her help.  Etc.  And you should definitely make up fun voices for all the characters.  Because that's the best.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167951/#Comment_167951" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T09:17:19+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  9:17AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

However, I also thought it'd be cool to have a space to record what actually happened.  That may be less necessary than I thought, though.  I just worry about people missing a week because of a vacation and then coming back and trying to reconstruct what happened.<br/><br/>The "series of mini-games/activities" approach is an attractive one, but I'm not sure if I have the creative capacity to generate 180 unique activities by myself and have them all be enthralling.  I was thinking of playtesting a month at a time, over this winter, but generating new months at the speed at which playtesters would be going through them (one a month) might even be hard.  Maybe I need to consider Daniel's approach to <i>Do</i> and recruit some folks to help me brainstorm different things to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167973/#Comment_167973" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T10:33:14+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 10:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Save the special mechanics for just Sundays and special holidays and use the routine mechanics otherwise. Having special rules for all days would mean not actually having much of a rules baseline at all.<br/><br/>Writing things down seems unnecessary to me - whatever the participants remember is what they remember, and that's that. More significantly, the calendar provides a baseline for what is going on in general. Perhaps you'll want to write the calendar backbone in such a manner as to have each month happen in the generally "same" situation all the way through - if the calendar tells me where the protagonist is and what she's trying to do (as well as the name of the boss she's currently resisting, perhaps), then what else would we really need to write down about it?<br/><br/>If you decide to create mechanics that use the notebook, then that's again different.<br/><br/>Also, have some mechanics that make it matter when the players skip days, weeks or however much they need to skip. That will, paradoxically, make it more appealing to go back to the exercise later instead of just forgetting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167978/#Comment_167978" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T10:42:10+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 10:42AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, a couple thoughts:<br/><br/>a) Use the equinoxes and solstice as your start, end, and middle.

Personally I'd keep it unpredictable and accommodate different learning styles along the way.  <br/><br/>The <i>Do </i>thing:  Do that.  The constraints (child, parent, bed time, calendar, booklet, bed) are really compelling.  I really like the idea of tying it to the seasons, that's nice.  And choosing "special days" is really great.  You could give the kid the ability to declare special jubilee days as well that had their own related-but-discrete events associated with them, or maybe that are entirely defined by the kid.<br/><br/>This is really a charming project.  It reminds me a bit of <i>Sweet Agatha a</i>nd <i>Merryweather</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168006/#Comment_168006" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T12:01:30+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 12:01PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are all fantastic thoughts so far, thank you.<br/><br/>On the <i>Do</i> model, I was thinking about maybe writing out a list of chapter headings and single descriptive sentences, like: "The Old Oak: Gerda must climb the tree and find the wise owl, who will invite her in for tea."  And then maybe other folks could help by describing various complications or short activities you could do to make Gerda's journey more interesting, which I would then edit down to fit onto the calendar. Maybe I could just post the headings to SG / my blog a couple weeks in advance of when they were needed for playtesting, so I could have time to compile the resulting suggestions, mix in my own thoughts, and post the calendar pages for playtest groups to download, print, and use.<br/><br/>Also, Josh, if this year's playtest is going to start on the Autumnal Equinox (Sept 22), I'm going to have to really get moving.  Having the mid-point be the Winter Solstice (Dec 21) -- rather than Christmas or New Year's -- is really good, though.  I've been trying to figure out how much of the original story's Christian tone to keep.  Gerda fights off militant snowflakes by saying the Lord's Prayer and summoning angels, for instance, but I don't think that's quite where I want to go with this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168018/#Comment_168018" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T13:18:32+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  1:18PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the dad of a seven-year-old boy, I'd say more action, please, and silly stuff too - references to people's behinds is apparently always funny.

Personally, I kinda like the religious elements because it feels more "old school" and is a break from all the magical, commercialized crap that kids deal with.  But I can definitely see how it would be problematic for some folks.  Also, having angels is a step more inclusive than having the Lord's Prayer, etc.  So, yeah, there will probably be a few paragraphs where I talk about some of the issues and possibilities there.  Like, I might want to throw in couple of those awesome Islamic angels from Persian art, with the multicolored wings, while other folks might want to excise all traces of religion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Amy%20Garcia" title="Amy Garcia"><img alt="Amy Garcia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Amy%20Garcia">Amy Garcia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168048/#Comment_168048" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T15:47:38+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  3:47PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2008 3:47PM by Amy Garcia.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that this is a <i>fantastic idea</i>.
