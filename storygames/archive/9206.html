In English, it's easy with a group of English-speakers to remember who is who in a pool of Western names (at least, after a few minutes). Even with non-western names, it usually comes down to just a few such characters, so they too are easy to remember.<br/><br/>But what about an all-African, all-Aztec, all-Chinese, all-Indian, etc game? What tips and tricks do you use to remember the names yourself, or to get other players to remember them?<br/><br/>Thoughts:<br/>1) Get character sketches. Grab portraits of actors from IMDB. Print them out on some cards or peices of paper, and leave them in the middle of the table. It's easy to remember who "Govinda the Sellsword" is if they mentally associate it with a portrait of Hrithik Roshan.<br/>Pros: Visual-learner people can remember easily.<br/>Cons: LOTS of setup/work.<br/><br/>2) Refer to people by titles rather than names. In Japanese-themed games, this is easy. Most often, their name is already immediately associated with their profession, so "Genta the Toymaker" can be called "The Toymaker", "Osaki the Shamisen Player" can be "The Shamisen Player", etc.<br/>Pros: Variance, you can mix it up with some people known by their name, some people known by their profession.<br/>Cons: Eventually, if folks slack off then everyone will be known as their profession name, which carries no cultural flavor. ("Yeah, that magistrate guy, I go talk to him. First I stop off at the seamstresses' and talk to her about her husband, the barrelmaker.")<br/><br/>3) Name variance: We tend to do this subconsciously, but yeah. Don't start everyone's name with "A", rather mix it up, even if it produces some real-variant results. Also, in Japanese games (and probably other cultures, China?) you have lords with last names and stuff, and then you have middle/lower class people without a legal last name, just a given name. So the variance in names might be easy to remember, or be a trigger in recalling those names:<br/>Okiku<br/>vs<br/>Watanabe Shogoro<br/>vs<br/>Ryouji<br/>vs<br/>Harimaya Tozaemon<br/><br/>What do you do?

Often the problem gets solved by referring to a character's distinct identity (the "worried chieftain" rather than Agonaq), and I've noticed that players tend to select names that are authentic-sounding but distinct and easy to remember (like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> name variance above). So one character might be Maluq and another be Viqlak, instead of Anuquranok and Qurakanoq. Also, the relationship map tends to stay on the table during play, and so there's an easy reference right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203707/#Comment_203707" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T12:26:24+00:00" title="April 27, 2009 12:26PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2009 12:27PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a campaign that was <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/games/rpg/saga/" rel="nofollow">all up in the Icelandic jonx</a>, and I think we skated by on name variance and enthusiasm.

Works for my style of games enough to never make names a problem. To illustrate, last weekend we played a playtest session of a fantasy game involving mongols that conquered Finland, more or less. The fabulous names of the NPC stuff consisted of Kublai (male), Gengissa (female), Temujin (female) and Shangri-La (a castle). This degree of idiotic simplicity is, of course, comedic at first, but nothing says you can't just ignore that and focus on what you're actually doing instead of worrying about secondary stuff. I'm completely serious in that if I had needed to name another person, it'd probably have been another Kublai or Gengis or Temujin simply because I couldn't remember any other Mongolian names at the time.<br/><br/>Names do, of course, have poetic value. It's just that not all styles of play utilize that value. Some do: I actually spent a minute forming up the name for my important NPC antagonist in our recent TSoY campaign, settling on "Nadir" as a suitably fantastic ("nadir" is an uncommon word in Finnish, so it almost sounds like a real name) yet adventurous choice. In the same campaign I've named characters based on product information labels from stuff lying around the room as we play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203715/#Comment_203715" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T13:07:25+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  1:07PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>In the same campaign I've named characters based on product information labels from stuff lying around the room as we play.</blockquote>\nAlso known as "The Usual Suspects" method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203722/#Comment_203722" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T13:48:46+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  1:48PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Also, we used the English version for place names a lot - nobody said Fjarvertey, but we all said Far West Island.</blockquote>Do this whenever possible. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203732/#Comment_203732" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T15:10:27+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  3:10PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2009 3:14PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For Chinese names, I tend to insist that people translate given names into English and only use Chinese surnames ("Blossom Xu" instead of Xu Hua) or go by nicknames ("the Mountain-Squatting Vulture") because otherwise things tend to dissolve into stupid.

When we ran a game with Japanese-named characters, I broke out the common elements of the names, so that the barely-memorable syllable clusters could instead be treated as larger, consistent chunks.  Even when it comes to shorter names, I've found it it's easier to get a non-Japanese speaker to pronounce, and remember, "Mae" + "da" than "Maeda", and then to leverage that familiarity to make "Imada" and "Maebayashi" easier next time, and then "Hayashikawa"... No one was tripping over names, and everything went really smoothly.<br/><br/>The same trick has stood me in good stead in dealing with phrase-length Sanskrit-derived Indian names, both in-game and IRL.

I remember watching my host cousins play Diablo and about 1/2 of the monsters would have Chinese names (skeletons, ghouls, vampires, other common things), but the rest would only have names in "English" (Balrogs, Baal, Wendigo, etc.).  There are words for traditional Chinese fantasy creatures in Chinese, but most of the words for Anglo-American fantasy tropes are imported from English and a lot of the time it's just easier to keep using the English term than develop a Chinese one.

Is awful.  OK if I make him 'the incompetent man with the flawed plan' instead?").
