                    Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if you read my question on intent, this is a series of questions I've always wanted to ask the pros in indie gaming!<br/>
<br/>
When you're designing a game, what's your favorite part to make?  Do you enjoy coming up with new or original mechanics?  Do you enjoy creating the mood and setting?  Is the concept of what a character is and how they will develop something that you harken to?  Is it an almagem of many things to make a complete and unique whole?  <br/>
What do you ytuly enjoy the most when you are designing a game?<br/>
<br/>
Now I've written about games, and mad esome supplementals for existing games for a long time, but I'm still making my first (and going on years now as it is a side-hobby project rather than something that I'm living and breathing).  For me, I am not particularly stuck on the mechanics.  My mechanics are somewhat trite, but still work for the feel that I am trying for.<br/>
<br/>
The setting has been done to death, and then raised from the ashes and redone some more...so the typical setting in a generic context isn't really new either.  <br/>
<br/>
But for me, it's taking the mechanics and revising the standard ways (point buy character system, increasing dice to represent levels of mastery, etc) and designing them to emulate a life-like semblence.  that's kind of fun.  But when I take my personal slant on the mood setting, most especially the mood...or is the technical term now flavor?...and creating a union of the two, that's what gets my creative heart pumping.<br/>
<br/>
When my test players sit at the table (for the group I am running...there are 4 other groups that are playtesting my system without my influence) and they're ready to go and attentive that's everything I talk about when I mention the cool factor.  When the players ask to use the phone becaus ethey want to call their husbands and wives to let them know that they'll be late because they'd rather keep playing my game than go home....that's what does it for me.<br/>
<br/>
So when I'm making a game, the most favorite thing for me is striking the balance between mechanics and playability  (NOT game balance, I;m talking about being fun to play and fun to learn) and coupling that with a decent setting that my players get into.<br/>
<br/>
And for you?                </div>

                            Well, not to be a spoil-sport, but designing a game is <i>work</i> to me.  I love doing it, but not because it's fun.  I wouldn't do it, for instance, if I were never going to expose the game to others.  That's where the pay-off is, for me ... when I put the game into the hands of other people, and they do things with it that I never anticipated, but that are even more awesome than what I intended it for.<br/><br/>If I get glimmerings that there's that sort of potential in the game?  That's a good thing.  That may be why I'm a believer in mathematical elegance, because I've often seen it transform into later player-awesome.                        </div>

                            Hey man, I just wanted to say that I kinda giggled when I read this part:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gladen</cite>...this is a series of questions I've always wanted to ask <b>the pros in indie gaming!</b></blockquote>
But, to your topic, I am not a designer in full (haven't released anything), but I am a designer in the sense of anyone who has "house ruled" a game (as per Ben Lehman's definition of a designer). And I realized that I hadn't finished/published a game because most of what I'm interested in is:<br/><br/>* Cute new toys and tools...<br/>* ... to improve the experience I am having in ALL games, or one specific game that I'm playing<br/><br/>So that's what I get most out of design conversations, and stuff like the Little Ideas forum here: Just little things that I can use in my regular gaming group to make our regular games better: new player authority tricks, new tools to use to keep people focused or having fun at the table, etc.<br/><br/>For example, the Disruption Egg Timer is something that improves our normal gaming, and it was an idea that I came up with on the spot, and works a lot:<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=290972" rel="nofollow">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=290972</a><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            There was a writer, I forget who, that said "I hate writing, but I love having written." RPG design is an itch you just have to scratch, y'know? A puzzle that always needs solving. What's curious to me is that I have different feelings towards RPG design than board game design.<br/><br/>There is that intense love/hate relationship with RPGs, but board games are much more light-hearted and casual. I find the most satisfaction in board games when I figure out how to implement the rules of an expensive  or inaccessible game by using cheap or free components, thereby breaking the price barrier.                        </div>

                            Y'know, now that I'm thinking about it in these terms:  I've had people say to me (basically) "Yeah, I love designing games, but about halfway through the process, when I've done all the color (or whatever) and need to buckle down, it starts to feel like <i>work</i>.  I guess I'm just not a designer."<br/><br/>I need to thwap those people lovingly on the head more.  Of <i>course</i> it starts to feel like work!  It's work!  Feel lucky if you got part of the project done while on some wierd contact high from your own ideas.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gladen</cite>This is a series of questions I've always wanted to ask the pros in indie gaming!</blockquote>
Then you have come to the right place, because I am, without a doubt, a pro.<br/><br/>Wait, you meant "professional"?  Oh, I thought-- Nevermind.  Uh, I'm an amateur.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gladen</cite>When you're designing a game, what's your favorite part to make?</blockquote>
Money.  I like to make money.  When you design an independent pen-and-paper RPG, you stand to rake in <b>dozens</b> of dollars.  It's loot, dog, and that means respect on the street.  It's like big round bags with dollar signs on them, man.  When I add up the phat cash that I made while working on the first edition of Dread, it was like, $1.31 per hour.  Cash money.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gladen</cite>What do you ytuly enjoy the most when you are designing a game?</blockquote>
Okay, all seriousness aside, I love the problem-solving.  I feel that there is a shape, somewhere in the back of my mind, and this shape defines a game experience.  The question is, how can I produce that experience through the mechanics, and through the documentation of said mechanics?  Designing a game is the process of documenting a system, so it's a lot like video game design, or technical writing (two other passions of mine).  I love the challenge of writing down the way that something needs to work in order to produce a desired effect.<br/><br/>With pen-and-paper design, however, the procedural documentation pertains to an exercise of the mind.  It's not dry and business-oriented like most of the technical writing that I've done (I mean, it's hard to get too excited about the documentation of a state government database interface), and it's not related to the type of interaction that you find in most video games (because most of the time, video games feature a player interfacing with a television screen or computer monitor).<br/><br/>Pen-and-paper design is intriguing because you're defining a set of rules which will govern interpersonal exchanges.  There are tools, such as dice and paper, but these are only the instrument, not the focus.  The focus, in my estimation, is the interaction between people.  Their words, their thoughts.  To create a game that allows a group of people to explore each others' minds is fascinating to me, and it's really what drives me.<br/><br/>Hope that made sense.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            For me, that part of the process of designing a game when stuff starts clicking together as if by magic, except you know that it came out of your head somewhere, and all those years of studying other games and debating with other designers about the best ways to do things and reading arcane Forge articles and studying your own play experiences PAID OFF.<br/><br/>Before that moment, you question every decision you make. This part of the game doesn't seem to belong at all. These two parts of the game don't seem to fit together. Then you tweak this and that and everything starts falling into place. <br/><br/>Ever put a puzzle together? There's chaos in all those pieces until stuff starts coming together. That coming-together feeling is <i>awesome</i>.                        </div>

                            I think my favorite part of designing is the epiphany, the moment when, for a brief instant, my mind sees the whole game and its setting at once, and the rest of the time is just catching up with that. <br/><br/>Admittedly, my games often come out different from how the looked in the epiphany. Sufficiently Advanced is a <i>huge</i> example for that; it's radically different from the original idea, and (I think) better for it. But that moment of seeing it all is a big thing for me.<br/><br/>Other things I like:<br/>* Tinkering with the game mechanics.<br/>* Mentally "mapping out" the game and its setting in broad strokes.<br/>* Seeing the game become available for others.<br/>* Having others enjoy the game when I run it.<br/>* Hearing from others who run the game.<br/><br/>Things that are not so fun:<br/>* Writing detailed information on the setting<br/>* Having the game vanish into the giant morass of the market.<br/>* Losing money.<br/>* Losing over a hundred pages of work in a hard drive crash. I'm not sure I can ever work on Valence again; not as it was anyway. It's just too painful.<br/><br/>--Colin                        </div>
