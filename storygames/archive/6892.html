I was preetty impressed.  After a quick download and read of the core rules I'm still impressed and considering running it alongside my dnd 4th edition game (had to mention it, good for blood flow). <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said do you guys have any advice for someone who is newb to wushu? <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly if people could answer these questions it would be appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\n1&gt; I'm not a big fan of count under systems, It seems to me that I could set the target number to seven and simply add the d6+skill rating to see if I pass or fail the individual dice. Would this change any of the outcomes or fiddly parts that i maybe am not thinking or knowing about<br/>\n<br/>\n2&gt; I understand the principal of narrative truth or whatever you call it, but in play does it lend itself to "subtly stated win conditions?" does the veto really make up for this if so?<br/>\n<br/>\n3&gt; What do you run in wushu (having read a bit of wushu skidoo, I must admit the aberant supers game seems like an amazing set up)<br/>\n<br/>\n4&gt; Is their anything wushu is very good at (not so much in a theory sense but in a gamey sense, cowbows and indians not narrativism if you please)<br/>\n<br/>\n5&gt; How important are the dice limits ( on a scale of 1 - 10 where 1 is not at all and 10 is very much so, please using whole positive intergers between the numbers 1-10)<br/>\n<br/>\n6&gt; The book kind of mentions subsystems/tacked on hackability anyone got some examples for me<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your time <br/>\n<br/>\nLogos                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153468/#Comment_153468" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T20:52:50+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  8:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my take based on running a year-plus of Wushu-hacked Exalted.<br/><br/>- Wushu is optimized to produce Dramatic Color.  It's only a resolution system in a broad sense.  There's a binary pass-fail at the end of the rainbow, but all the details come from player and GM descriptions.  It's no good at anything tactical because it just doesn't model that.  But for color and dramatic detail, it's damn good.<br/><br/>- The simplicity is a strength.  I bolted on all kinds of extra rules, FATE-lite Aspects, etc., and I regret doing so.  Things would have moved a lot faster had I used the basic system with a couple of minor rules mods.  As it was, I made it way too fiddly.  Run it straight or very close to straight first before you get kinky.<br/><br/>- Die limits are important.  At certain points, I had players rolling up to 14d6 thanks to my hacked rules, and the die-counting alone bogged things down.  Plus players didn't care as much about narration when it yielded only three or four dice out of the pool.  Since Wushu's main point is to generate Tha Cool, that pretty much dragged it down to a mediocre die mechanic.<br/><br/>- All that said, it just fuckin' sang for Exalted.  We had a Dragon-Blooded group with an Immaculate, a Sorcerer, a Court Assassin, and a reckless ex-Cavalry officer.  When we were on, especially in the early games before I'd completely Frankensteined it, they rocked the house.<br/><br/>- I don't know if subtly stated win conditions would apply, given the potential scope of the PoNT, but we never had a problem with having to veto anyone.  Eventually, the players got burned out on having to supply the details, though.  Some players found it really hard work and wanted to concentrate on other things--method acting priorities, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
