I thought it might be of interest to the writerly sorts on SG. \n<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Story Squared</b>*</div><br/>Write a number of short stories, all of which have a word-count equal to the number of stories in the series.<br/><br/>For example, if you were doing a 100x100 challenge, you'd write a hundred short stories, each of which is exactly 100 words.<br/><br/>If you were doing a 25x25 challenge, you'd write 25 stories, each of which is only 25 words.<br/><br/>If you were doing a 6x6 challenge, you'd write six, six-word stories.</blockquote>\nThis is sort of a "<a href="http://www.lifeclever.com/what-50-pounds-of-clay-can-teach-you-about-design/" rel="nofollow">50 Pounds of Clay</a>" exercise to work out some creative blocks and hopefully create some cool flash fiction in the process. This would be handy for for projects that call for lots of little bits of flavor text.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the original LJ post, what intrigues me is the game-like tension of deciding what challenge you'll pursue. You can choose to write fewer stories, but that severely restricts your word-count. You can choose to increase your word-count, but that quickly means you'll have to write a LOT more stories. You can also "squish" the challenge to make it taller (write twice the number of stories than the word count in each story) or wider (write number of stories equal to double the word count in each story).<br/><br/>Anyhoo, thought some folks might find it an interesting challenge.<br/><br/>* Credit goes to Ryan Macklin for coming up with the name "Story Squared." I'd given the idea the less approachable name "NxN Challenge.") ^_^                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90803/#Comment_90803" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T16:41:00+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  4:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a great exercise.

I started working on my 20 x 20 using the theme "Hardboiled".  Here's what I have so far.<br/><br/>1.  The minute she walked in the door, he knew he was lost. She batted her eyes, and he was right.<br/>2.  She married him for the money, and she killed him for more of it.  The last mistake got her caught.<br/>3.  The gun boomed in his hand, and the cop\xe2\u20ac\u2122s head snapped back against the wall.  The sirens got closer still.<br/>4.  She made her gin and tonics strong.  Too strong.  A man died tonight because of what they made him do.<br/>5.  Wayne stroked her hair like he always did.  Except this time she was dead and he was the killer.<br/>6.  Sammy the horn player was blind while he was playing.  The boss paid him lots of money not to look.<br/>7.  Regina adjusted her ample bust and painted her lips.  She wanted the bastard to know what he was giving up.<br/>8.  The room turned sideways and Johnny couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t keep his balance.  The cop laughed and knew he wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t talk to anyone.<br/>9.  He stole her heart and he stole his money.  It was the American Dream, times two, except for his wife.<br/>10.The car hit the brick wall at speed and the driver was killed instantly.  Everyone thought the governor was untouchable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
