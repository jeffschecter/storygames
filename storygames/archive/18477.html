The Fastaval folk mostly liked it, I think, though it didn't have too many runs. It got nominated for a "best presentation" Otto, so I think it was received pretty well. There's also been a run in the UK, one in the US, and I think one is planned in Sweden too?<br/><br/>Part of the feedback I received is that people were prepared for a saddy mcsadderton cry bleed game. Most players found the workshop to be tougher than the actual game play. This was intentional on my part -- I wanted the workshop to add some emotional depth to the issue, but ultimately, the game is about living on despite receiving shattering news, so it's not a let's-wallow-in-tears sort of thing. It's the sort of situation that outsiders feel they have an intuitive grasp of -- obviously we'd all do whatever seems most 'logical' -- so I wanted to add some pathos to the situation to complicate that.<br/><br/>Part of the "Americanness" of the game is actually in its assumed knowledge about the health system. For example, the idea that genetic testing for embryos is permissible, when in fact it's controversial (or possibly illegal?) in many Scandinavian countries. I did get pigeon-holed into "the woman game" box a bit, but I think that's hardly a uniquely Scandinavian take.<br/><br/>Another thing that surprised me is that the people running the game sometimes had perceptions about what the "right" and "wrong" outcomes were that didn't agree with, for example, what my life choices are and will be. And sometimes players and GMs made assumptions about what I might have chosen. While obviously, a lot of my personal experience is embedded into the game, the characters are distinct enough that I've got some distance on the issue.<br/><br/>I had a tough time choosing which part of the situation to focus on -- I think for people not in my situation, the deciding-to-test thing is interesting, and the first draft of the game was about that. That piqued my wonderful sparring partner, Troels Ken Pedersen, who urged me to re-write the game to be about the most interesting part of the experience for me right now, so that is what I did. And I simplified some of of the medical information to fit it onto the GM page.<br/><br/>My advice for writing close-to-home games is well, it's complicated. If you're writing about your own experience, I think you want players to have the freedom to make choices that differ from your own, which means trusting the dramatic set up of the situation. A game like this has to be about the periodic table of human emotion -- the universals of the situation as mediated by your unique personal experience. And players need to be able to have their own unique personal experience of those same universals. I also think it's important to distribute engagement with those universals across the players, as opposed to choosing a main character. If you want it to be close-to-home for the players, that's a whole other discussion. I have a lot of half-baked thoughts on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416067/#Comment_416067" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T06:41:24+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  6:41AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             Lizzie, that's just awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416151/#Comment_416151" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T06:37:53+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  6:37AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow! <br/><br/>I'm a little bit in shock. <br/><br/>Lizzie you are totally brave and awesome for making a game like this. <br/><br/>This kind of heavy emotional content is what I've always wanted from gaming.

He's done a few games within this genre, including (most famously and controversially) Fat Man Down, which is a game that is more often talked about than played.<br/><br/>Good starter jeepform games, if you're looking to get familiar with the genre are Previous Occupants and Robin's Friends. The first is a ghost story, the second is a game about friendship -- but their approach to serious issues comes with a more accessible edge, in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416185/#Comment_416185" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T12:29:59+00:00" title="June 13, 2013 12:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played this game and it's just astonishing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416323/#Comment_416323" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T17:59:25+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  5:59PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2013 5:59PM by JoshDemers.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in awe.
