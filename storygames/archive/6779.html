If I just want to compete and win, it's not a relevant deterrent. Now, maybe that's a _feature_, since I have then effectively volunteered to take the "villain of the week" role in perpetuity.</blockquote>\nThat's half right. The owe list gives you two things: recurrence, and bonus dice when you want them. If you never get onto the owe list, at the end of the session you'll be at the mercy of the people who got onto it early and often. You're volunteering to play not just the villain of the week, but an ineffectual one.<br/><br/>If you want to play a serious villain of the week, get onto the owe list several times early in the session, then scratch yourself back off of it for the advantage dice before the session ends. This is the strongest single-session tactical play, and it has the benefit of making for an interesting, threatening villain instead of a one-dimensional one.\n<blockquote>...clearly, the optimal first move in IAWA is something like "as the clock strikes noon, my Far Reaching plans come to fruition and I gain immortal mastery of reality."</blockquote>\nThat's not a legal move in IaWA at all, any more than it would be in D&amp;D. In IaWA, like in D&amp;D, you describe what your character does, you don't ever say what happens.<br/><br/>It might help you stick to legal moves if you limit yourself to "I do" constructions. "I walk down to the marketplace" or "I fight my way to the throne room" or "I shout magic words at heaven." Strictly speaking, IaWA doesn't demand 1st person - you could say "my guy Marku walks down to the marketplace" instead - but just be sure you're always talking about what your character does, not what happens to or around him. Even "I gain" or "I hurt you" or the famous "I convince you" go too far - you're saying the outcome you hope for, not what your character actually does. Try "I reach out and take," "I punch," and "I say" instead.<br/><br/>The other players' legit response to "my far reaching plans come to fruition and I gain immortal mastery of reality" isn't "oh no I stop you!" but "you do? How? These alleged far reaching plans, they were what? Why do you think they come to fruition now?" Or even, if you're being particularly egregious, "come on Eric, back to the game."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150846/#Comment_150846" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T08:11:37+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  8:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite><br/>That's not a legal move in IaWA at all, any more than it would be in D&amp;D.

You have to make a character whose best interests <i>won't</i> follow straight from her best forms.<br/><br/>So let's say you've got your grizzled warrior character.

You can play the guy whose strengths align with his interests. It's fun. You can also play the guy whose strengths don't align well with his interests. This is also fun. On top of those, you can play a guy who is very driven to achieve his goals or you might play a guy who is his own worst enemy and just doesn't act in his own best interest at all. Both fun.<br/><br/>The game design doesn't ask you to make one of those character types as the one right way to play.

Maybe we need to work out <i>why</i> something is in someone's best interests, or what will happen if their best interests are not achieved (or even pursued). This lack of pursuit is also problematic because of the advice to make best interests target other characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150911/#Comment_150911" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T14:24:11+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  2:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jimmy McNulty<br/>Best Interest: Stop drinking and prove to Daniels that he is good police.<br/><br/>We know it's in McNulty's best interest to stop drinking and get his shit together.

"I walk down to the marketplace" or "I fight my way to the throne room" or "I shout magic words at heaven." Strictly speaking, IaWA doesn't demand 1st person - you could say "my guy Marku walks down to the marketplace" instead - but just be sure you're always talking about what your character does, not what happens to or around him. Even "I gain" or "I hurt you" or the famous "I convince you" go too far - you're saying the outcome you hope for, not what your character actually does. Try "I reach out and take," "I punch," and "I say" instead.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm not sure the distinction is as clear as you might hope.  Isn't it the scope rather than the actual verb that's the problem? <br/><br/>A friend of Steven Pinker once said of verbs "They are your little friends, aren't they?" He talks about how linguists define verbs in terms of basic concepts such as causation and motion. So, you can fill a glass, but not pour a glass. I think a list of sample from-to verbs would really help.

That's what I imagine anyway. Another thing I find useful if a statement is too results oriented is just ask "How?". I can keep asking "how" until I get an action in the right scope. This even works with stupid "I want to fly to the moon" type comments, if you haven't already picked them up and chucked them through the nearest sheet glass.
