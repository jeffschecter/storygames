This is something that has at times both puzzle and bothered me.<br/><br/>I love micro- and nano-games, settings, and modules.  So, as you might imagine, I've seen most of the more famous/popular ones.  And I've spent 100s hours hunting down every one that I could get my hands on--even some obscure one.  <br/><br/>And I also understand the idea of being concise and precise--I also love nano- or flash-fiction.  I understand the creative energy that working within limits gives.  That's why the 200-word RPG contest exist, I'm sure. <br/><br/>But if you're working with a container that has two sides, why not use all the space?  If your writing is so keen that it fits on one page, then why not use better or bigger fonts, word-art fonts, more art, better borders, more white-space, or add a useful table?  All of these enhancements can be so suggestive for people playing your game.  My goto here is Ghost/Echo.<br/><br/>Every time I print off a one-page game or module, I'm always a little disappointed.  I should be thankful, I guess, because they're always free, but it always leaves me wondering, longing even.<br/><br/>There is a very short comment about the difference between one page and one sheet in the Cyber/Punk L&amp;F hack thread, that finally got me to write this.<br/><br/>Obviously there is something I am missing, so if you have some thoughts about this please, speak, discuss, dismiss, complain, contest, rant, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470521/#Comment_470521" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-10T15:21:36+00:00" title="March 10, 2018  3:21PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that it's as much an arbitrary restriction as much as it is a practical one, frankly.

There are, however, three real applications I can think of:<br/><br/>The first is that if you have a text that takes less than one page, you're basically going to want to spruce it up to that size, because why not. An atmospheric picture will fill the extra space if nothing else really needs to be said. That's just plain good graphic design.<br/><br/>The second scenario is specific to old school D&amp;D: a "one page dungeon" has real usability because the atomized structure makes for quicker handling and look-up at the gaming table. The fact that OPDs have helped dungeon designers look critically at what they're actually doing is also a plus, but even putting that aside, I think that the one-page format has real merit for a complex sandbox where you could be handling dozens of adventure modules side by side simultaneously. I've even considered formatting some non-OPDs into that format, it's just so much easier to use at the table compared to a 2-6 page "small dungeon".<br/><br/>There's a third scenario where artistic merit lies in the one page specifically: if you're making something where the artistic impact relies on taking it all in at once, then it can't be split into pages - paging strongly implies linear access, after all. However big the page/poster needs to be, that's how big you make it. It's a specific format. Admittedly it is rare for a roleplaying game to rely on this effect, but I think I've seen something along these lines at some point. Visual poems, on the other hand, are usually in this format for this exact reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470541/#Comment_470541" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-11T13:59:36+00:00" title="March 11, 2018  1:59PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a><br/>Of your three applications, the  first I don't get.

It's to do with the way things are arranged on the page, so <b>if</b> you put everything modularly so I don't need to flip back and forth constantly, then it can work.<br/><br/>Also, one sheet as opposed to one page - still good for D&amp;D usability, not as bad as say 4 pages. This isn't a case of usability falling to zero immediately. Rather it's a case of usability dropping sharply when you add one, two, three, four pages, until somewhere around page four or so you might as well make it 40 pages with minimal loss of usability, as you're clearly going to be shuffling pages all the time anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470550/#Comment_470550" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-12T04:12:38+00:00" title="March 12, 2018  4:12AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So for me, in putting together Cyber//Punk, I started thinking about the 1-sheet restriction as a user experience issue. That is, the goal of a 1-page game is not simply the aesthetic elegance of reducing your ruleset down to the bare minimum of what's needed to run the game, it's also about creating a streamlined player experience.<br/><br/>In this, I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">@yukamichi</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen%27s">@Eero_Tuovinen's</a> comments. Flipping a sheet, just like flipping through a rulebook, inhibits play. I only added a 2nd (back) sheet to my game under duress, after a friend suggested they'd really like to see some scene-setting tools, and then <i>only</i> because these seemed non-essential \u2013 you could play the complete game without printing that back sheet. So the goal of a 1-page \u2013 which is both a graphic design goal and a game design goal \u2013 should be that you have all the information you need to play the game simply by glancing down at the table. In my experience at least, this materially affects play.<br/><br/>If you're going onto another sheet, you need to have a very good reason for doing so, and you need to think very specifically about the scenarios in which the player flips the sheet. There was a suggestion in the Cyber//Punk thread to put all the player rules on one sheet and all the GM rules on the reverse. In that case, you have a single-sheet document where no-one at the table needs to flip the page (a good UX outcome). Or you could tie the page-flip to the advancement of the story or characters or game phase \u2013 actually integrate the flip into the game as a mechanic. But it shouldn't be arbitrary.<br/><br/>And yeah, there is the consideration of people not being able to print double-sided automatically. If it's something you're printing yourself, no big deal, but what seems like a small friction to you could be a total dealbreaker to someone else. And if the majority of users are just going ahead and printing your one-sheet game on two sheets, that's kind of a fail state for your nice, streamlined design. (Or let's say everyone's running it on a tablet! Then they're scrolling back and forth when they could just have a single page onscreen.)<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that I don't feel the 1-page vs 1-sheet restrictions are arbitrary, and each one actually results in a different play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
