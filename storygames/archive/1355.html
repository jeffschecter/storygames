                    A couple or many things have been building up in my mind.  First, there is <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1342&amp;page=1#Item_10" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> that Jonathan started.  Then there is <a href="http://gamingphilosopher.blogspot.com/2006/09/culture-of-criticism-part-i.html" rel="nofollow">Victor's post</a> over on his blog about a 'culture of criticism.'  Then there are a swath of connections too difficult to disentangle but include in no particular order: Vincent's talk of designing in cells, big questions coming up about the goals of indie game community/communities, the discussion of what 'your thing' is as a player...  Enough background, though.  Questions:<br/><br/>Anyone ever looked at Julia Cameron's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vein-Gold-Julia-Cameron/dp/0874778794/sr=8-2/qid=1158176851/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-1618118-0776768?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Vein of Gold</a>?  It is all about helping creators (especially, but not only, creative writers) figure out what themes are most powerful for them, on the premise that working with themes you find powerful and moving makes it a lot easier to write.  <br/><br/>Anyone ever thought about doing something like that to get your game design juices flowing?  Even in small doses, her ideas are suggestive.<br/><br/>Anyone notice certain designers with a vein of gold?  If you are a designer, do you feel like you have a 'vein of gold?'  <br/><br/>This is the part that hooks back up to the thread/post mentioned above.  It strikes me that seeking out the 'vein of gold' in a work is a very positive and powerful way to sharpen game review practice, something that already seems to be at work in a lot of Forge-driven design praxis (power 19, big three, etc.).  Jonathan opened up his thread mentioning he would like to learn from Jason's historical sense and it hit me.  If I were to suggest a vein of gold for Jason, it would be somewhere in that mixture of historical setting, risk, and constraint.  Now that's simplistic, but I bet there is something to that which could be meaningfully developed.<br/><br/>This is, yes, very author-centric and there are reasons why you don't want to get stuck in that mode of approaching a product, but it always strikes me as a good place to visit, to look around.                </div>

                            I totally know what this is for me. When I'm making a role-playing game, I frequently have trouble with making very alien settings and then just letting it get too out of hand. I've found that I am most likely to complete an RPG if I have an allegorical backbone that is personally and emotionally relevant to me. This even translates into my board games.<br/><br/>When I'm making a board game, I'm remembering when I was very young, living with my mom in not-a-good-place in Queens, NY. Back then, I would constantly make my own toys by recycling whatever loose scraps I could find around the house. Socks became dolls, cereal boxes became buildings, yada yada. Today, that frugal nature is what spurs my desire to create games that use the fewest, cheapest, most ubiquitous components possible and to recontextualize non-gameish components. It's entirely by accident that this also sometimes leads to an elegant abstract game.                        </div>

                            I think you hit my current Thing, Isbo.  It helps working in proximity to a 5.6 million volume academic library system.  I've always found history more interesting than fiction in general, and I return to it again and again for first inspiration.  I don't think that will ever change, although my current fascination with constraints probably will.                        </div>

                            I'm told (and I think I agree) that my 'thing' is interesting and somewhat crazy economies.  Some of my best suggestions to others have been economical/mechanical things (Daniel, above, credits me in Punk for a suggestion of that nature).  I'm mostly hooked into a game design when I have a nifty and interesting approach mechanically to whatever it is I want to do.                        </div>

                            I think my real niche as a designer (mostly scenario design; I haven't really found my mechanics niche) is in manipulating 'real world' into speculative fiction.  I've done multiple articles and game ideas based on there being <em>dragons</em> in your stapler.  Now, does it make it easier to write these things?  <br/><br/>Honestly?  No.  Because I write better when challenged.  I find more impetus when I've got different things I need to learn in order to ...um... make something up.  For a while I think I was the World's Authority on internet pickle art.  (Erm.)                        </div>

                            Most of my gold comes in system form. I can create traditional RPG systems well, and quickly, and they do what I want. I'm still learning how to do less traditional stuff, but it's very rare for me to have any system I create break in any major way. (Of course, I say this as I'm facing my general distaste for the system I wrote in S.A., but that just underscores the whole situation for me.)<br/><br/>In terms of setting and feel, I'm all over the place. I really enjoy the bizarre, and so many of my games have strong wacked-out elements, but I don't feel like I'm any better at it than others.                        </div>

                            My thing is codifying stuff that people already know how to do into mechanics, so they can do it more intentionally and consistently.  Dev says I'm about making patterns and cycles, and that's probably true too.<br/><br/>I am also really, really into the idea that incorperating input from every player is more important than finding the input that most benefits the narrative at hand.  But maybe that's just the Communist propoganda talking.  In any case, I'd much, much rather have a player self-censor certain inputs that weren't appropriate for the game than for the other players to shoot down their contributions (which can be soul-killing, even when done respectfully). Many of my designs aim to prevent the latter from ever happening.                        </div>

                            It's kind of soon to tell, but I bet my thing as a game designer is texture, flavor and sensuality. I want the flavor in games to be accessible and real, not just tossed in as part of the fiction. I want all games where it's relevant to have a menu of foods, clothes, music, for the setting. What else? I want GMship to be shared around. I want most everything to be public. I want injury to be realistic and sexuality to matter - which is a logical outgrowth of being an EMT and a sex ed teacher.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br><br>My Vein right now is finding ways to create Gamist supporting games that also involve lots of narration of events and actions.  I read on another website that Gamists hate to narrate.  That's a load of BS.  I'm out to prove (and with Cutthroat and Holmes 'n Watson I've got a good start) that Gamists are every bit as creative and artsy-fartsy as Sims and Nars.  I'm taking a lot of advice I've gotten over the years from people like Vincent, Paul, Ron, JBR, and Chris and putting it to good use.

                            My vein of gold is moral choices: specifically, that there is always a most moral choice, and that people can do it. I'm a strict moralist and optimist, which are funny to have together. In The Shadow of Yesterday, players define the influences and pulls, both internal and external, on their character, and then are challenged to walk in a world where their every action affects it and its future permanently. In The Face of Angels, characters are given ultimate power to change the world, and then told that the world will hate them for it no matter what they do, and then still forced to change it. In The Princes' Kingdom, they are kids with the keen sense of right and wrong that entails, and then they're loosed on the world to see if what they think is right and wrong is true.                        </div>

                            My vein of gold is directly proportional to my (pathetic) inability to recognize it. I'd love to hear what people think it might be, because I think this is not just a good design exercise (in that it helps designers capitalize on what they do best) but also a good marketing exercise because it helps designers understand their point of difference and can better create a brand, a message, and an offering for customers.                        </div>

Beast Hunters is all about Gamist narration <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Seeing that that's my only finished design so far, I'm not sure I can claim a vein.  So far it's just one big nugget.  But the things that I'm going to carry on from there are definite openings and closings: for the game session as a whole, for conflicts, and for other parts.  I'm done with puttering around not knowing what's going on or where we're at in the game, or whether my input is actually going to address anything.                        </div>

                            Human psychology is something that comes up again and again in my games.  Also, walking the line between player and character and using the real emotional, visceral experiences that the people playing a game have as the meat of the game itself, without falling into total bleed-over.  The themes I'm drawn to are about self-discovery and subversion: about gender and romance with Breaking the Ice, about character and competition in Shooting the Moon, and about identity and assimilation in Sign in Stranger.  The next slot of games I've got coming down the pike just get nastier and more dangerous: sex, infidelity, polyamory and core insecurities in Under My  Skin, and slavery and revolution in Rise Up. <br/>
<br/>
Player collaboration, even in competitive venues, is central to design for me, and I'm right there with Jonathan Walton and Meg about decentralizing game play.   Another aspect of design that sings for me is utilizing the players' unconscious in the process:  the color association in Breaking the Ice and the mad-libs world development system in Sign in Stranger are all about that.  Play can be richer than we might consciously let ourselves have it be if we tap into our subconscious via free-association and spring-board creativity.  I personally find role playing challenging yet most fulfilling when you have to come up with stuff off the fly, so I try to design to make that easy, like falling off a log to come up with interesting stuff. And having all the players work together and have their ideas interlock makes it possible for everyone to get to feel like a rockstar, by getting further insight and improvisation happen off of what they came up with.  <br/>
<br/>
If I hit a tenth of that in my games, I'll feel like a lucky girl.                        </div>

                            I don't know if it is my "gold vein" or not, but my foci in design right now are meeting the social needs and constraints of people like my wife and myself.<br/><br/>This includes but is not limited to:<br/>  *  Easily available random generators (six-sided dice, playing cards) - though this is shifting as my wife buys more and more polyhedrals for herself.<br/>  *  Minimal prep time for everyone.  My time outside of the game is limited, so if I'm running it, it needs to be easy to prep.  Similarly, my wife is unlikely to read a game book cover-to-cover and even less likely to want to mini-max details, so char gen needs to be quick and intuitive, and to a lesser extent balanced.<br/>  *  Quickly understood settings - or settings that can quickly crafted/adjusted by the game group.  See the reading game books thing above.  The game that has worked best for our current group has been Prime Time Adventures (with a close second of Adventure!).  With PTA we literally sat down and said it's a show about college-age superheroes and we are basing them on heroes everyone knows rather than forcing everyone to learn a new mythology.<br/><br/>Typing this up, I guess my current thing is "audience".  Or more specifically, designing for a specific audience.<br/><br/>Blue                        </div>

                            Ah! Duh. My vein of gold is the distribution of creative authority. I've democratized narration! Sweet.<br/><br/>To date, my games have been about dismantling any notion that groups of human beings <i>should</i> invest in one-and-only-one of their group with the arbitrary power of determinig the entire group's entertainment. I can't easily imagine me publishing a <i>good</i> game with such assumptions.<br/><br/>So, how can I make this work for me? It makes me realize that my strength as a designer is creating systems that use currency, techniques and other controls that empower everyone at the table. Cool. When I design a system that does not do that, I'd better self-examine to make sure it's "right."<br/><br/>And, this is also helpful in shaping up some marketing approaches. For example, I could pitch something like "Chimera Creative Games: What Everyone Says Matters." Ok, that's terrible, but you get the idea. It actually helps found a baseline for figuring out how to shape pitches to con-goers, create ads and messages, talk about it in forums, and so on.                        </div>

                            This is all great, thought-provoking stuff--thanks to everyone for your answers so far!<br/><br/>Ok, here are extra-credit questions for you designers who have multiple designs:<br/><br/>Do you feel like some designs are more 'on your vein' (not that they are necessarily better, just that they 'feel' better to you, they resonate with something important for you)?  Do you feel that you have ever worked a vein dry and moved on to a different vein?  Or are you really just exploring the many fascinating facets of a single vein?  Have you ever had the experience of starting a design and abandoning it because it just didn't resonate with you?  The mechanics may have been ok and all, but...?<br/><br/>And I would really be interested in hearing some of the other questions I raised get some answers--most particularly, if anyone has ever done or considered doing some workshop-workbook approach to help them 'get in touch' with what they want to design?<br/><br/>It's probably pretty transparent that I have some ideas about all this, but I'm really trying to nurture those ideas with others' insights before I go anywhere with them.                        </div>

                            Ian, I think all of my designs are efforts to learn how to address my Thing better or from a different angle.  Even in some that stand out as being really different -- say, <i>Seadog Tuxedo</i>, which is about pirate penguins -- I'm still addressing my thing (in <i>Seadog</i>, it's in the freeform narration dueling).  I definitely think there have been some that have been more successful than others and some that have worked towards the Thing from completely opposite starting points, but I haven't gotten close to mastering the Thing yet.  Probably I never will.<br/><br/>I didn't finish my Reverse Engineer game on time because I haven't been able to figure out how it addresses my Thing yet.  That definitely made my plans for it seem less alive.  Hopefully, I'll figure that out soon.                        </div>

                            Evil Hat's Vein of Gold (I freely include Rob in this without consulting him) is examples and explanation.  We may not be the most innovative out there, but we explain the *hell* out of how to use the things we provide, and why they're there and done that way in the first place.<br/><br/>I don't know that I really understood this at all points throughout Evil Hat's first five years (I call it five in order to include Fate's free years, but we haven't really been a company for more than two), but looking back, and especially given some of the comments we've gotten on DRYH and SOTC, it definitely seems to be our recurring theme.                        </div>

                            My design thing is about interface. I'm most interested in what people are physically doing at the table. sometimes thats a conversation with occasional dicethrowing, but really i want a lot more then that. The sitting around and just telling stories with mechanics isn't enough for me, i want the interface to give me MORE experiance, and the games i'm working on currently (strangly, with the total exception of my reversed engineer game) are all about this notion that play is more then a discussion.                        </div>

<p>Like Matt S., I dig finding ways to distribute narrative authority and mechanically sewing together the narratives the players produce.</p>
<p>I like finding the Big Issues and pushing the players to make statements about them.</p>
<p>I like making players make hard choices.</p>

Maybe there's another vein for you, but that's at least one of 'em.                        </div>
