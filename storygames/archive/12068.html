He also mentions having subscribers, and draws a distinction between blogging (and in particular how hard it is to make a living by writing a blog) and his "micro-magazine" concept, which at least suggests that the latter is meant to be sold.  So basically, maybe he is talking about commercial products, or at least not closing off that possibility.<br/><br/><br/>Fuck if I know whether anyone could make money doing that, though, especially for a tiny little niche like gaming.

He starts out by asking if anyone reads Newsweek. The answer is yes. 2 million people read Newsweek. I'm one of them. It gives me a bunch of political coverage I can't get anywhere else. The problem is, when they don't have anything political I want to read this week, I don't buy the magazine. Eventually Newsweek will probably disappear, and I won't have anywhere to go for the stuff that I get out of my Newsweek.<br/><br/>So I think that Seth's saying there's a place for something digital and micro-sized to replace Newsweek and its ilk--something that people are going to pay money for. How is this different from a blog? A blog can't afford to fund investigative journalism. A blogger probably can't spend a whole year travelling with some presidential campaigner. There are things you can do with professional staff and a budget that you can't do with a blog.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what that has to do with gamers... but then again, there's Fight On! I'd have to read a dozen different blogs and slog through 10x the volume to get the value I get out of one issue of Fight On! Actually, I do read all those blogs, and I STILL buy Fight On! So FO is definitely giving me something I can't get for free by reading blogs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Which isn't the World Wide Web. <br/><br/>Joshua, right there with you on MAKE's ads. I think the key might be to exercise some Draconian editorial control over the ads. Since participation<i> is</i> advertisement, the editor might require that your ad highlight how your thing could make a particular article more fun. Or how your thing harmonizes in an intriguing way with an article's point of view. Or maybe your ad kitbashes somebody's adventure to work with your thing.

I think the key might be to exercise some Draconian editorial control over the ads.

But there are ads for bike plans and iPod hacking kits. Two issues ago, there was an ad for this guy's services (he's the dude who built Doc Brown's DeLorean) one page before an article about him.</p>\n<p>That said, there are a couple dozen ads, counting the ones in the back. I don't know of anyone in our crowd who could effectively charge what you'd need to charge to the number of advertisers you'd need to make that have a meaningful effect on the cost effectiveness of the project. If you want the final product to be <em>free</em>, that's even harder.</p>\n<p>That said, <a href="http://magcloud.com/help/faq" rel="nofollow">MagCloud</a> seems to have become much more reasonable lately. I'm concerned about the quality of their cover stock, but might throw something together just to see how good it winds up being.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270563/#Comment_270563" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T00:06:27+00:00" title="May 10, 2010 12:06AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is the future, one way or another. Vogue, like all magazines is a dinosaur slated for extinction. But it won't be pdfs - it will be multimedia for devices like the iPad.<br/><br/>The key difference is that it will be Push media - something you'll subscribe to (for a fee or not) - so that you will get it when it's fresh and hot.<br/><br/>And everybody wants ads. When you buy a car magazine, or a computer magazine, or a fashion magazine, or a photography magazine, you're buying it as much or more for the ads as for whatever pathetic "content" it has.<br/><br/>But the real sea change will be the elimination of the distinction between content and advertising. Everything will be product placement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
