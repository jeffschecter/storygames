Because they is all weirdoes they are intrigued and suckered in by the absurd setting and premise. Some of 'em have played trad. rpg's at some point in their lives (like Vampire or D&amp;D) and are NOT interested in doing that again whatsoever. Which is good, because we're gonna be playing the Roach. <br/><br/>The group consist of close friends looking for just some time to enjoy and check out this weird story games i've talked about to them. We also play boardgames together and they love DIY-anything so they are at least interested in that part of the whole deal. Also one of those guys told me that even if the game would suck for us, we'd still be spending time together. Which i think is an most awesome-award-winning attitude! <br/><br/>Back on topic. <br/><br/>Out of a couple of games we picked the Shab-al-Hiri Roach because it seems rather structured and the cards present the players with ideas to take the scenes. Also it doesnt have lots of rules which can only be good thing right? Creativity by restraint. <br/><br/>Now i only really worry a little about the first round of scenes. It seems to me that the rest of the story will just built from whatever gets esteblished in those first scenes. As it will be a table full of noobs with no direction and no storygaming history, how to kickstart those first scenes ?<br/><br/>Any tips on that? <br/>any tips on the Roach for complete newbies ? <br/><br/>thanks all!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203518/#Comment_203518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T06:23:53+00:00" title="April 25, 2009  6:23AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2009 6:24AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a couple of times with a table full of non-gamers, and each time it went very well, so don't worry on that score.  My advice to you is my advice to everybody - start out strong and model good behavior in your first scene.<br/><br/>Use the "I love you and you hate me, I hate you and you love me" thing to kickstart a conflict.  Bring in a Luminary and do your best to ruin the guy you hate.  Establish some piece of backstory while you are doing it.  Explain what you are doing as you do it.<br/><br/>Vigorously takes sides in the first round.  Be really big about supporting one player and building a faction to take down another.  Drop dice in every scene, just to model being constantly involved.  <br/><br/>Another good trick for somebody who is creatively stuck is to encourage them to frame a scene in which they can include their Expertise and both Enthusiasms.  You cannot have a boring scene with both Enthusiasms in play.<br/><br/>In one game I intimated in my first scene that there was a Pemberton Rod and Gun Club, and that its preferred quarry was the bottom fifth of the undergraduate class.  The PC I hated was an Assistant Professor, new to campus, so I framed a scene around his Rod and Gun Club initiation.<br/><br/>One last suggestion - unless you are spreading it across two nights, consider trimming a couple of scenes, since things will probably go a little slowly.  Just take a vote and drop one active scene and one more sedentary scene.  Leave the Luminaries as they are and end on an active scene.<br/><br/>Have fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203544/#Comment_203544" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T12:07:30+00:00" title="April 25, 2009 12:07PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First up, this is an article written by Jesse Burneko that I wish I had read before my first (and so far only) time playing The Roach:<br/><br/><a href="http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/2008/08/29/game-spotlight-the-shab-al-hiri-roach/" rel="nofollow">Game Spotlight: The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</a><br/><br/>While I enjoyed playing The Roach, I would have enjoyed it more that way.<br/><br/>Second, we we're all playing it for the first time and we felt that our plan of playing it all in one sitting was too much.

(in chapter 4 "scenes" ?) should we set stakes like:<br/><br/>a) Stakes are wheter professor Munchkin will chant the sumerian spell correctly and create dedicated followers out of the three students.<br/>b) Stakes are professor Munchkin will chant the spell and create dedicated followers out of the three students IF he wins.

It really requires some sophisticated storytelling skills. Get everyone used to using Director stance: narrating stuff apart from just their character. Similarly, they need to be driving towards conflict, while being prepared to enjoy losing. Most importantly, it's not <i>really</i> a competitive game. The competitiveness is an illusion, although a fun one.<br/><br/>On the horror aspect: I personally think that it's important not to drive the horror up too soon. Keep it creepy and character-based towards the start, then go mad towards the end.<br/><br/>I find Roach requires a lot of energy. Breaks between events are good. If you find the group is running out of creative ideas, take a longer break and resume as necessary.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203596/#Comment_203596" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-26T09:56:20+00:00" title="April 26, 2009  9:56AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1b - once there's a clear conflict, make sure you know who is on which side and see if more roleplaying needs to happen.  After it is resolved, there's probably more roleplay and narration to be had as well.  <br/><br/>2c - roll the dice when the uncertain outcome is going to halt the scene unless it is resolved. Be alert for this point so nobody ends up spinning their wheels.  <br/><br/>3c - stake-setting can conform to your local play culture just fine.
