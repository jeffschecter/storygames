We all know that people talking about our games is how our games sell, but is there more to it than that? How can we encourage people to talk about our games and generate excitement about it without it looking like shilling?<br/><br/>So, what is it?<br/>How important is it?<br/>How do you create it (in a genuine way)?<br/>How do you harness it?<br/><br/>I don't have much to add, but I'm eager to learn! I'm rubbish at generating buzz - I think it might be something to do with my natural english state of embarrassment and modesty! Dead of Night was nearly stifled by my lack of talking about it, from conducting the playtest in private forums to not posting actual play reports or barely mentioning it! So I have plenty to learn.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59185/#Comment_59185" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T06:55:24+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  6:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: andrew_kenrick</cite>I'm rubbish at generating buzz</blockquote>\nHere I am!<br/><br/>Sorry...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59258/#Comment_59258" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:47:19+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:47AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2007 10:47AM by Anemone.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's true, Fred and Chad are in fact very good at creating buzz in a nice, friendly, unasssuming, non-pushy way.  I think it helps tremendously not only in direct sales, but also in creating contacts that can be useful.  I like their games, but I also like many other comparable games, and I sometimes feel very sorry for neglected games that deserved better but were not promoted and supported enough.  I know game designers don't necessarily enjoy the promotion part (some do, some don't, some hate it) but at least being friendly to fans, offering some resources on your website, and <i>creating at least one online location fans can use to exchange comments, play examples and questions</i> go a long way without requiring any hard-sale spiel.<br/><br/>We have so many online tools now -- blogs, forums, wikis, mailing lists, review sites, etc. -- that are there just waiting to be used...  I really think a few such connections can really improve visibility in the gamer community and push a game to the forefront.  The key point, I believe, is cross-linking; if all your buzz is in a single place (say, all on Story Games or all on The Forge, etc.) then you're not getting enough buzz for your effort.  You're only speaking to one constituency.  What you need -- or what your product needs -- is to appear at least a bit in many places so more people have a chance to notice you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59264/#Comment_59264" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T10:58:06+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 10:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found that, quite simply, posting about the cool bits of your game (particularly writing if you have/are a good writier, or art, if you have/are a good artist) is really, really useful.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59291/#Comment_59291" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T12:29:29+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 12:29PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I found that, quite simply, posting about the cool bits of your game (particularly writing if you have/are a good writier, or art, if you have/are a good artist) is really, really useful.</blockquote>\nThis touches on one observation I did NOT make in my long list of bullets: Be open with your design process -- at least partially.

As I believe you chaps in places outside of Scotland may say.<br/><br/>Fred makes a good point and one that i learned in between doing a|state and Cold City. a|state had a totally closed design process. Cold City was much more open. Next stuff I do will be even more open than that. it comes from the realisation that being secretive serves no purpose and is fundamentally counterproductive.<br/><br/>Being cool in person is a valuable thing. By that i mean being approachable, friendly, running a good demo at cons and generally being decent. Which you already do Andy. People spoke very highly of you and your games after Conception, which is great. And your presence at Dragonmeet was rocking. Peope will go away and talk about you and your games in a positive fashion, even if they may not like the game, if they come away with a good impression, there's an increased chance they'll talk about it online, to friends, etc.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59316/#Comment_59316" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T13:24:18+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  1:24PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, do you "buzz" much about other people's games?

I'm terribly worried about coming across as a shameless pimp.<br/><br/>The bit about being open about your design process is spot on. I'm with Malcolm on this one - when I designed Dead of Night I made the classic industry mistake of doing it utterly behind closed doors, when it would have been so much cooler to do it in the open. I'm trying to design Six Bullets in the open, but I'm still not talking enough about the design processes. Must try harder.<br/><br/>Graham - yes, I definitely buzz about other people's games. I like talking about games I like, and believe in telling people what's so great about them. I'd like to think people do the same back, but I'd hope no one did it out of obligation. I don't think they would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59586/#Comment_59586" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T09:13:19+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  9:13AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have exactly your concerns, Andrew.

Have a dedicated blog that people can comment.<br/><br/>(2) If you/your games already have fans, also start a mailing list (Yahoo group, forum, etc.) where you can post announcements and allow fans to discuss the upcoming game.<br/><br/>(3) Have all relevant links in your sig file on every forum you post in, but not gigantic and multi-colour.  Remain tasteful!  :-)<br/><br/>(4) If there is opportunity, exchange blog comments with other authors on similar projects and post in forum threads, but don't manufacture excuses.  My feeling is that if you have a good reason to think something about your game is cool or unique, it's perfectly legitimate to articulate it in discussion; and if you are frank and courteous, there shouldn't be anything objectionable.<br/><br/>(5) Don't hesitate to give sincere compliments to other authors, but only if you mean them.  Still, it buys some good will.<br/><br/>(6) Have the patience of a boddhisatva and address all comments and questions courteously.  Even the stupid ones.  (They might be mine!)<br/><br/>(7) If you have dedicated fans, encourage them to post actual play threads, reviews, wikis, Web sites, etc.  Tell them that it really helps your visibility.  Ask them to post these threads somewhere visible, like RPGNet, EN World, etc.  I love Story Games for the conversations, but it's not the most visible forum.  Yet.<br/><br/>(8) Keep your Web site or blog updated, and link to all these fan-generated bits.<br/><br/>(9) Include freebies and downloads on your Web site: character sheets, scenarios, additional material, maps, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

I'm still not as calculating and purposefully marketing-driven as Guy wants me to be, but that's fine for me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nWhat steps are you taking Christian? How are you generating buzz about BH? I first learnt about Beast Hunters through your posts here about the art, so that excited post certainly worked on me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60065/#Comment_60065" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T04:08:34+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  4:08AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's all great advice Sophie - I think I tick about half of those at the moment, but am working on hitting them all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60715/#Comment_60715" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T19:32:22+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  7:32PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to promote Beast Hunters strictly by talking about things that excite me.  Here's a thing that's cool, and here's another thing that's cool, etc.  You're allowed to express your enthusiasm on your blog; blogs are after all billboards for advertising your life.  People will in general respond to enthusiasm in kind, so long as you aren't pushing it on them.  <br/><br/>In all of my yap about Beast Hunters, I've done a harder sell-push once (saying the preorder is happening, and talking a bit about how small press companies live or die on direct sales more than anything -- but even that latter message is done sort of with the message of, "Hey, here's this topic I care about, and my opinion on the matter.  This is why I think it should matter to you." rather than a "Buy buy buy! Now now now!") and I expect I'll top out at maybe 2 or 3 "buy this" pushes out of about one to two dozen general enthusiasm-sharings.<br/><br/>The best advertising -- the best buzz -- happens when you show people enough stuff to get them interested in talking about it on their own.  By talking regularly, by sharing your enthusiasm, but not pushing it onto those who don't want it, you're keeping your product visible and you're giving people reason to be excited about it.  That's buzz.<br/><br/>To get a little mercenary, you're also creating pockets of special knowledge.  The folks who know to check your blog or look for your posts on a web forum get to adopt the special knowledge -- the new enthusiasms you're sharing -- as their own.  This means they then get to turn around and be the guys and gals who are "in the know" about something new and cool.  <i>When this works right, it means that your closest fans get to become rock-stars in their own right.  They get to pick up on the buzz and own a part of it; they get to have some of the cool rub off on them because they are the purveyors of the special message.</i> <br/><br/>This is a killer chain-reaction to be able to kick off; simply by sharing your enthusiasm about the thing you're working on, you create -- as a simple side-effect of being read! -- a personal set of soldiers/true-believers/lieutenants/marketeers who get to be cool by carrying your enthusiasm out to an even broader audience.  And then this audience comes to you, and connects direct to you, and thus gets promoted to be a part of your army.<br/><br/>After a bit of practice at it, you can start subtly encouraging this process to happen, by crafting the message of your enthusiasm such that the folks reading it are encouraged to "tell a friend!".  I've done blog quizzes, viral advertising where I "tag" my blog readers to post about the game, "here's how you can help something you love" manifestos, telling people I think they rock when they say they'll post some actual play they did, etc.  I do that, yes, because it IS cool and IS part of my enthusiasm, but it also has the pragmatic buzz-building effect of touching off the chain reaction I'm talking about here.<br/><br/>But it all comes back to a simple core: share your excitement.  You're bound to find other people who are just as excited about it as you are.  Build relationships with those people -- make real and genuine friends out of fans -- and it'll all just come natural from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60720/#Comment_60720" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T19:57:55+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  7:57PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred's exactly right (of course).  I'm sharing my own excitement, too.  For example, today I got the proof copy, which is totally amazing--I am holding my work IN MY OWN HAND!  So I took a few pictures and just now put them up on my livejournal.  Sure, it's part advertising, but I would do it even if I wasn't selling it, because I like to share things I enjoy.<br/><br/>I've been answering lots of questions, I'll send out review copies, but most of all, I'm just open and honest about the process and participate in discourse about that and many other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
