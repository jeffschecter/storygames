I've quite a few games with all three of these players (T, L and K), but none had ever played IAWA.   T called Blood &amp; Sex, and we drew:<br/>\n<br/>\nA band of demons, laughing and malicious, authors of debauched sensuality and corrupt appetites.<br/>\nA priestess of a merciful temple of healers, on pilgrimage to the birthplace of her order.<br/>\nThe night each year that a certain ghost is allowed her freedom.<br/>\nThe deathbed curse of a betrayed queen.<br/>\n<br/>\nL played Nimsunu, a ghost allowed her freedom once a year.   It's in her best interest to walk the earth freely forever and to be reunited with her husband, Mekka Eil.<br/>\nT played Sirta, a priestess on pilgrimage.  It's in her best interest to purge corruption from the birthplace of her order and to excise unquiet spirits.<br/>\nK played The Deathbed curse of Queen Erisht-Aya announcing that if the system allowed him to successfully play a curse he would deem it the best game ever. It's in the curses best interest to see Sirta die at the hands of her daughter, Gemekaa, and to preserve Gemekaa's marriage to Mekka Eil.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe oracles presented relatively few NPCs, so I added NPCs as needed as the players added best interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ghost of Queen Erisht-Aya needs the curse lifted, and Nimsunu imprisoned.<br/>\nZain, a malicious, laughing demon, needs to seduce Sirta.<br/>\nGemekaa, needs to protect her mother, and leave her husband.<br/>\nMekha Eil, needs to lay the ghost of his ex-wife to rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo complete the setting we established the Sirta is the detected descendant of the traitor cursed by the Queen (centuries, maybe millennia ago), the game would take place on the night of the ghosts freedom in the ruined city where the order was founded, and the Queen once ruled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd call the game an absolute success, and I've been left with the definite sense that this is probably one of my favourite games.  We had lots of sex, not so much blood, but that would have come later if we'd had more time.   The big question I still have with this system is how literally to interpret "Don't roll the dice when two characters are having a conversation, no matter how heated it becomes; wait until one or the other acts."  (I had near open rebellion when I tried to apply this rule the first time I ran this game.)  The problem being what constitutes action?<br/>\n<br/>\nMekha Eil is trying to beat his wife, the Curse is trying to influence his mind to prevent him.<br/>\nZain plies Sirta with alcohol and then sleeps with her.<br/>\nAs Sirta attacks Zain (who's disguised as Mekha Eil to seduce Gemekka), the Curse influences Gemekka to attack her mother.<br/>\nNimsuna convinces Sirta she is her goddess.<br/>\nNimsuna makes Mekha Eil remember the love he once held for her.<br/>\nSirta orders Mekka Eil to leave the camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with two out three characters being incorporeal, conflicts aren't likely to be simple fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case we produced an impressive collection of story material in a short space of time.

So, like:<br/><br/>Mekha Eil is totally trying to do something concrete by beating his wife, so that's a conflict.<br/>Zain sleeping with Sirta is a concrete thing, so that's cool too.<br/>Gemekka attacking her mother is a concrete thing; in this case, I guess there's some kind of metaphysical grappling going on between Gemekka and the curse for control. Unless the way you played it was that the curse could only influence people by telling them to do stuff, in which case maybe not.<br/>Nimsuna convincing Sirta she's a goddess and making Mekha Eil remember his love, I don't think count, there's no concrete non-verbal goal there at all.<br/>Sirta ordering Mekha Eil to leave the camp, probably not a conflict if she's just telling him to do it, but sure if she starts pushing him around, getting other people to throw him out, etc.<br/><br/>This is just how I read it though, so I'm keen to see what others suggest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177043/#Comment_177043" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-02T06:14:44+00:00" title="November  2, 2008  6:14AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse's got it.<br/><br/>Legit:<br/>Me: I say "she never loved you, you know."<br/>You: The hell you do.

The question is what actions are valid to announce, and what I can stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nVincent:<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, thanks.  I think that's the clue I needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what about this?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou: I say "she never loved you, you know."<br/>\nMe:  The hell you do, I shoot you such a dirty look that you shut right up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there concrete actions other than "I say" that one can take in a conversation?   Let's zoom in on one of my examples from play.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  The demon bandit offers Sirta a chair and some brandy.<br/>\nT:     Sure, I have to deal with unpleasant people to get through to the temple.<br/>\nMe:  We spend some time drinking and chatting, and after some time the demon gets up and moves around the table sitting next to Sirta, with the alcohol and the mood, passions are inflamed within you as he removes your clothes.<br/>\nT:     Hell, no, I'm getting out of here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I've announced two actions, one of those is clearly legit:  Zain removes Sirta clothes.  The other (inflaming passions) seems borderline, as I'm introducing an emotional change within Sirta.  Can I do that?  Does it change things if I have a (possibly far-reaching) particular strength that backs it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'm fully aware that unless T is willing to give it in negotiation (which he was), there's no way the seduction can succeed (actually, hang on, at the risk of getting side-tracked, I remember seeing a thread were you suggest resolving the implied stakes early in the conflict, so maybe it can).   Now let's say we roll dice, Zain gains initiative, which of the following can I announce:<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  Zain kisses you passionately.<br/>\nMe:  Zain kisses you passionately and you kiss back enjoying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, that in a straight up fight, I can announce the action and consequences:<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  I drive my sword into his chest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the answers so far.   I need to play more now.<br/>\nAdam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177071/#Comment_177071" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-02T11:57:28+00:00" title="November  2, 2008 11:57AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2008 7:07AM by lumpley.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your challenge: "I drive my sword into his chest."<br/><br/>I reroll to answer.

We could have three rounds of Zain making advances and being rebutted, without me losing a dice roll - the consequence of which would be Sirta being exhausted by the whole matter.<br/><br/>In theory, I'm well aware that the consequences of the action are completely non binding.  In practice I think it's very easy to fall into implied stakes thinking.   So, what happened at the table, is that the dice my way, and he gave and the we negotiated out to the seduction succeeded, which as I read it is a 100% valid way for the conflict to go.  Now, the question is, did he give me that because he was happy with that outcome or because he believed that he had to give into to the implied stakes.   (I suspect both are true.)<br/><br/>The one thing that's becoming clear is that characters are completely sacrosanct and can't be killed, maimed, convinced, angered, seduced, intimidated or driven insane without the cooperation of their player.   The only thing that can be done against their will is to be put at a disadvantage, injured, exhausted or written out - and in all those cases I presume the player gets to provide the details.<br/><br/>So, before we go to the dice, if I open with <br/><br/>"I drive my sword into his chest."<br/><br/>and you don't grab the dice to challenge me, then you have a sword in your chest.   That is that in order to interrupt and cut me short, we have to grab the dice.  So, my "you kiss back" is binding, unless the dice come out.<br/><br/>Now, coming around to the reasoning behind the ban on verbal conflicts.  There's not much point in having a conflict to convince someone of something if the system gives you little chance of doing so.  A verbal conflict would have lots of ignorable challenges, which would be crap and make the final injury/exhaustion unconvincing.  And I guess, if people can't sort out their problems peacefully they're more likely to end up hitting each other which makes for good gaming.<br/><br/>Cool, I've got a whole lot more stuff in my head about this, but I've probably reached a point to find people and try out playing some more.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Adam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177253/#Comment_177253" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T06:31:08+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  6:31AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!\n<blockquote>Now, the question is, did he give me that because he was happy with that outcome or because he believed that he had to give into to the implied stakes. (I suspect both are true.)</blockquote>\nI imagine that both are true. A strong challenge has power beyond the mechanical - "I chop you down and hack your body into pieces" will result in different outcomes from "I swing my sword at you," even if the dice play out the same. "You kiss back enjoying it" is an important thing to say, even if it turns out to be false, precisely because it imposes upon me a non-binding but tangible social and creative expectation.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
