                    I'd like it if we could start promoting new indie designers (or indie designers we might not know about), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">designers that don't usually post here, or don't ever post here</span>. Everyone already knows about John, Vincent, and Jason, so let's keep this thread about new people doing new stuff--people who might not come here to promote their own stuff.  In your travels across the Internet who have you found doing great stuff that we should watch. Give us a name, a thumbnail sketch of their work, and a place where we can view it.  <br/><br/>Their work can be but doesn't have to be in English!<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for making this a great thread                </div>
