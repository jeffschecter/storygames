I tend to run games with Japanese elements, or set in Japan (Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, where all the characters are ex-yakuza, etc). But I'm just going with what I know: I speak the language, I used to live there, I return every two years for a few weeks, etc. <br/><br/>Thing is, there's a lot of games with a huge Japan component to them. Everything remotely cyberpunk has something to say about Japan. There are a number of Japanese-themed RPGs, including fantasy (L5R, Bushido, etc) and contemporary (Panty Explosion). <br/><br/>I was just curious why that was the case, given that there's no published games on India (or games that have an Indian component), a single D&amp;D campaign world for Africa (and as mentioned elsewhere, RIFTS: Africa is shit), not much for the Middle East (Testament d20 was pretty cool, though; as was the Arabian supplement for Cyberpunk based on a novel), and nothing I can recall for South America. There are a few interesting games about China (Qin, Mythic China, Feng Shui, etc), but China doesn't seem to have as much of a footprint as Japan on the RPG scene.<br/><br/>There are tons of European-themed games, which I totally expect and have no surprise about, given the origins of the hobby: It's just that, outside of Europe, Japan seems to get the most attention. I was wondering why people thought this was the case.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188986/#Comment_188986" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T07:52:28+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  7:52AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Japan has cool stuff I guess.

Although the dress and a few emotions are very different than Western history, it's not so "out there" as to be totally incomprehensible. "Oh, just play up 'honor' a lot and you've got it!" is a gross oversimplification... but not too far off, really, even when you watch Japanese TV dramas and movies.<br/>For reasons unclear, we've been given a bigger taste of Japan via the media so we know at least these bare bones ("Honor!" "Sushi!" "Geisha!" "Yakuza!"), meanwhile I don't know what to "play up" for an Indonesian, Masai or Sri Lankan character simply because there haven't been as many movies/shows featuring those cultures.<br/><br/>2) Japan was the big name in technology in the late 70s and early-mid 80s, when folks were writing all that Cyberpunk stuff. So it just somehow got a bigger imprint.<br/><br/>3) Samurai and Ninja were overglorified in western media (like NINJA 3: THE DOMINATION, which made every teenage boy in the 80s want to be a ninja). Almost as much as they are in Japanese media, but that's another story. It was the fact that the Ninja Boom (and to a lesser extent, the Samurai Boom and Kung-Fu Boom) was happening during the early/formative years of role-playing after the release of D&amp;D, that led to inclusion in a kind of geek hierarchy.<br/><br/>3 is an interesting item to me, because I'm wondering if there's anything as geek-cool as Ninja but in other cultures (India, etc), that just haven't gotten as much media time.<br/><br/>Chinese Wuxia (Chivalry) heroes is definitely one. Glorified in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and other flicks.<br/>The Northern Indian Gurkha, with their badass curved knives that could decapitate horses, are another: But unfortunately, again, no air time.<br/>Polish horsemen were apparently the shit back in old times.<br/>Macuahuitl-wielding Aztec warriors would be fearsome as shit, but unfortunately we know little more than what Wikipedia and Mel Gibson tell us about them.<br/>Voodoo Magic is magical, and can only be stopped by counter-Voodoo Magic, and/or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImRsNaVq2NU" rel="nofollow">Steven Seagal</a>.<br/>and so on... I'm sure there are others waiting for geek manipulation, distortion and game time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188990/#Comment_188990" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T08:10:54+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  8:10AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems pretty obvious to me that this is just a part of the global cultural currents and how they flow. Japanese cultural exports have been making a big impact during the last couple of decades all over the world. When India, Africa, Arabs or anybody else gets that sort of traction, expect everything that is not bolted down to make an appearance on the global stage (including RPGs) as well in a big way. There's nothing particularly special in the way rpgs handle Japan as far as I can see. Everybody else is doing Japan now, too. One might perhaps just manage to argue that the literary genre of cyberpunk (which has strong rpg ties) somewhat predicted the cultural impact of Japan a decade in advance of when it really hit the global consciousness, but other than that there is no "special relationship" between rpgs and Japan.<br/><br/>A national culture is a like a brand, you see - even if anime, samurais, high tech consumerism, big robots, school girls and everything else "Japanese" didn't have anything else in common, they'd still have the national brand to tie them together. All of these culture phenomenons advertise each other to such a degree that we can speak of an "otaku hobby" or "Japanophilia". This is hardly unique to our times, there's been several currents like this in international history. Going in rough backwards order of relevance (remembering that many of these national cultures experienced several renevals), American, Russian, British, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Roman, Greek, Persian and Egyptian cultures, among others, have had their time in the global spotlight in the exact same manner we see Japan being encountered right now. In time the unique elements of this cultural influx will be integrated or crystallized into a milieu genre (like Charles Dickens represents a "British milieu genre"), at which point the global culture will move on to new inspirations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188991/#Comment_188991" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T08:11:55+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  8:11AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could it be also influenced by cultural xenophobic tendency?

We are just now hearing about awesome healthy grains from South America because the natives withheld them and considered them holy.

Nothing special to it, one could use the same methods to paint up almost anything as "cool", and the degree to which people'd consider it a "phenomenon" would basically depend on how much money you'd have to buy media time for your creation. I wouldn't put much stock on the inherent coolness of any given concept as an explanation for what gets popular and what doesn't - much more important than coolness is how people relate to the cultural messages the archetype captures. Ninjas are popular because they're an exotic Other, Rambo is popular because he's a hypercompetent Us - simple tribal affiliation shit. Finnish roleplayers like to geek up Baltic pirates (who of course were much cooler than any other pirates anywhere ever), but while glorifying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victual_Brothers" rel="nofollow">Victual Brothers</a> is a simple literary affair, selling that stuff to the US market would have minimal traction without the national historical myths that make the stuff interesting for the Baltic locals in the first place. The Americans are going to go for Caribbean pirates who have much closer ties to their own culture.<br/><br/>From that basis, looking at Andys list of suggested new crazes, I'd have to drop off the Polish horsemen - Europe is full of national targets for geekery, but they're not going to push any buttons for Americans who simply don't have a personal emotional relationship to most European nationalities. The same goes to somewhat different degree for the other examples, except China. I could see China having legs for a while yet, as they're increasingly prominent on the world stage, which makes art that explores the idea of "China-ness" very relevant. So they're the sort of "other" that we're going to be interested in and already are to an extent.<br/><br/>In summation: cultural crazes follow practical national relationships. I find some sort of Japanese exceptionalism ludicrous. National cultures have become strong export properties as a consequence of the vivid internal culture of the nation and the relevance that nation holds in the minds of others, not because some cultures somehow possess better stories than others. Nations you care about are the nations you'll be interested in as a source of geek mythology.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188998/#Comment_188998" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T08:30:44+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  8:30AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know why, but for some reason Japan has a certain mystique in the minds of Westerners, and few other parts of the world come close. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japonisme" rel="nofollow">Japonisme</a>, World War II, Godzilla, Japanese companies "buying everything" in the 80s, anime, etc. have all made Japan more (disproportionately?) prominent in pop culture and such. In that respect the emphasis on Japan in RPGs seems to be if nothing else in sync with other kinds of entertainment. Pretty much any part of the world could offer a neat setting for an RPG, but for Japan it's a bit easier than most to get people who know it well enough to write stuff, and to get people interested in buying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189004/#Comment_189004" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T09:17:02+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  9:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There have been several books and essays, starting pretty much around WWII, that note a mutual fascination between America and Japan. Both cultures fetishize each other, and sometimes fear each other, in ways that are moderately unique for each of them. <br/><br/>I no longer have access to LexusNexus or the other search engines, but if you've access to a university library you can probably find some of them. <br/><br/>Anyway, the stuff I remember being talked about include: <br/><br/>1) Japan has a rich and "exotic" culture that was never imperialistically controlled by a western nation. Both China and India got a lot of the same pulp exotification, but usually as a lower class of people -- they were the decadent, cruel, orientalist enemy, partly because they were both (to different degrees) colonized and culturally ransacked by western powers. Japan, otoh, wasn't. So Japanese culture managed to have all the "super kewl" of an alien culture, without the shame of being a colonized culture. Similarly there was a difference in the immigrant experience for Japanese Americans than for Chineese or Indian immigrants. (Not that it was great, and there is that whole camps atrocity, but it was different.) <br/><br/>2) America and Japan became imperial powers themselves at close to the same time, and both came late onto the otherwise European colonial stage. They repeatedly faced off against each other and ended up as dominant powers in the Pacific. Which, as we all know, lead to war with each other where America managed to do what no one else had done, ever. This combined easily with the warrior-culture ethos of both cultures to make them see each other as great and noble enemies, and then in the rebuilding afterwards great and noble friends. Also, after the war there was a long and ongoing cultural exchange with the American military and corporations having a standing role in Japan, and -- as several folks have noted -- Japanese corporations taking a standing role in America. <br/><br/>Of course, this also comes with undercurrents of fear of imperial competition still extant -- see Crichton's Rising Sun, for an example. For a long time Japan was the future -- as you say, Andy, they're a big name in technology. And through the 80s many American corporations studied Japanese corporate culture to "stay competitive." (Too bad they seem not to have learned many of the actually important lessons....) This lead to the 80s formulation of Japan as the corporate future, because Japanese war would now be economic war, and their mastery of technology would be their primary weapon. So combine respect and fear, and you get a powerful image. <br/><br/>3) The Bomb. Now, this is a sensitive one and one of debate about how deep it really goes or how important it actually is. But the fact remains that there  is a unique relationship in the world between American and Japan over nuclear weapons, and its cultural implications. <br/><br/>4) Warrior Culture. I pointed at this a little bit above, but its probably worth mentioning again. Most orientalists note that in the western construction of the east, the east is made both eternal and feminine. Easterners are soft, decadent, they smoke opium and have vast harems, and aren't able to get their country into the modern world. Japan, however, defied these constructions in various ways. (Not that Japan is any more or less "soft" -- just that westerners never defined them in those ways.) From the Meiji Restoration making Japan a modern country to the ritualistic warrior culture, Japan was different in the eyes of much of the west than other Asian states. (This is pretty explicit in some of the political and fictional works of the late 1800s.) This ends up manifesting decades later as samurai and ninja obsession, a perfect thing for geeks to focus on. <br/><br/>Also, I think its probably significant that many of the earliest eastern martial arts, and still probably the most successful eastern martial arts, in North America are Japanese. Like, people use "karate" to mean "martial arts" and judo has been a collegiate sport for decades. Even though many more arts now have strong places, and the growing imperial regard towards China, along with brilliant Chinese cinema, are shifting this role around -- karate was first, and karate is still deepest rooted in the North American psyche. (Karate Kid, baby.) <br/><br/>5) Counter Culture. India, especially, got associated with hippies through the 60s. India is counter cultural. China is a red menace, and complicated. Japan never had such a huge association with any given counter culture in America. Being obsessed with Hinduism means that you're probably a vegetarian freak, being obsessed with Samurai might make you a dork -- but you're a normal dork. Thus Japanaphilia fits the centrist to conservative cultural position that was a stronghold of early RPG players. <br/><br/>(cont)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189005/#Comment_189005" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T09:17:12+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  9:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So most of these are why Japan has more of a pop culture roll in North America generally. RPGers just took those elements and drove them to the extreme. Also, on the RPG front its probably significant that Japan has an RP culture of its own. I mean, until recently it hasn't necessarily had direct impact back on the Americas (until we got cool dudes translating, right?) -- but through video games, visual novels, manga, and such there has been a lot of "geek material" drift between nations. There are so many Japanese games, books, and what not of brave knights fighting dragons that its really quite astonishing. And many of them are quite popular in North America, leading to a great crossover between RPG freaks and Anime freaks. There's no equivalent cross with any Indian cultural or media product that I can think of, and China has made strides with wuxia and comics into Americas markets recently, but they still don't seem as deeply embedded as the Japanese. <br/><br/>Also, Eero's point about cultural branding is a very solid one. Japan, through whatever combinations of deliberation and historical accident, has an excellent cultural brand with American audiences.

That being said, I think the Japanese are fascinating because they went from being a war-like culture to being a very polite and obsessed leisure culture.  I mean, Klingon to Bat-Mite in 60 seconds - that's a new record.<br/><br/>Also, after WWII, America and Japan had a very odd relationship that has turned into a very prosperous friendship.  Its like the guy who you fight like hell with and then, when the fight is over, you go drinking with.  Even though China was a staunch ally in WWII, when the smoke cleared, it was us and Japan who grew closer (Mao might have had something to do with that, mind you...)<br/><br/>[tl:dr] VIDEO GAMES, Anime, Marshal Plan(maybe)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189254/#Comment_189254" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T17:31:58+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  5:31PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, I predict that India will be the next big entertainment cultural stash to be opened globally.

It became a hit because it was the only alternative fantasy setting out there. Most people at the time played Runequest like any other medieval fantasy setting, if they touched Runequest at all. Also Runequest was copyright, and Japan wasn't. TSR brought out Oriental Adventures, which although it was not a massive hit was influential.<br/><br/>The Ninja character class in Oriental adventure had instant munchkin appeal. It was seriously overpowered. The Acrobat class which came out at about the same time did not stand a chance. I remember role playing with two brothers in Guildford, who were also into martial arts and racism (both very popular at the time). One of them <i>insisted</i> on playing a Ninja regardless of the campaign setting.<br/><br/>The time this game came out it was possible for one game to have a huge impact on the hobby, and that is difficult to imagine nowadays. Perhaps if you made it so Sikhs could kill people through walls, and were immune to any bladed weapon, an up and coming generation would take to India in the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189277/#Comment_189277" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T20:17:00+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  8:17PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, <br/><br/>I go back and forth about India.

When you hear "it's kinda Japan", you immediately have a very strong (sometimes too strong, mind you*) image in your head: you know, katanas, kimonos, crazy dressed up badasses, samurai and bushido, ninjas and more ninjas, shurikens, geishas, onis, yokai, loyalty madness and whatnot. I don't know if we have anime or Kurosawa or xenophobia to thank for that (well, frankly I do, but that's not the point), but it's just a fact that the image is strong. Will it be the same when you hear "it's kinda like Mauritius"? I don't think so. Well, at least not before Jason presents us his new game about that <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> It's just that the info about Mauritius is so scarce. On the other hand, if you have "it's kinda America" statement, there's too much info, so the strong image is still missing. Technically I know a couple of indies that can be considered "games about Russia", but since they are all in Russian, this fact can only be of academical interest to you\u2026<br/><br/><br/>* \u2014 not to clutter the main body of the post, a small side story: a couple of days ago we had a prep/chargen session for a fantasy game (me being the player). The gm said something like "oh, btw, there's a yuan-ti civilisation living north of this area, and they are kinda like Japanese". I nodded, but later that day posted a <a href="http://www.gameforums.ru/journals/141778_yuan-ti.jpg" rel="nofollow">screencap</a> from Yaiba to my blog with a comment like "this is what you meant, right?" The GM promptly replied with something in the lines of "OH NO OMG NO DEFINITELY NOT LIKE THAT". Of course I was kidding/teasing, but I can imagine real inconsistencies being introduced by using a reference to an image that's too strong. Same thing as a metaphor being taken too far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189673/#Comment_189673" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T21:32:42+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:32PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, why do <i>you</i> like Japan?

But Japanese folklore, religion, ghost stories, art, textiles, tattooing, pottery, now that stuff is cool. So I don't have an answer for you. Fisherman's Wife is about the working/peasant class, free of the warrior and ruling class, because samurai and geisha are so boring to me. <br/><br/>Incidentally, I lived in Japan for a summer when I was 15. I lived in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awano,_Tochigi" rel="nofollow">tiny hamlet</a>, which doesn't really exist any more. My host family grew chrysanthemums and their house was about 200 years old, and surrounded by classic gardens, hillside cemetaries, and rice paddies.
