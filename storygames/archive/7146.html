It's going to be held on the lovely University of British Columbia grounds. It's expected to see 4,000-5,000 attendees this year, with some fantastic guests.<br/><br/>The reason I'm interested in AE is because the <a href="http://vancouvergamingguild.com/smf/index.php" rel="nofollow">Vancouver Gaming Guild</a> is running a gaming con within AE. Cloud City will be a gaming homage to anime, but also a showcase of what gaming has to offer. It's an exciting venue because AE brings in a lot of first-time players and excited con-goers. Vancouver gamers have some fantastic energy, and I'm hopeful that we'll have some great people coming from across the west coast.<br/><br/>Jake Richmond and Matt Schlotte, authors of Panty Explosion, Sea Dracula and Classroom Deathmatch, will be there as gaming Guests of Honour. Previous to the scheduling hiccups and the temporary cancellation, we also had Ben Lehman scheduled as gaming Guests of Honour. I have yet to re-confirm his attendance in light of recent events.<br/><br/>Any questions? Hopes?<br/><br/>I have floor space for several, and am planning to rent a hotel room for story gamers from out of town who need space.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158969/#Comment_158969" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T21:10:05+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  9:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rats.
