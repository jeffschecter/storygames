I definitely wouldn't worry about offending anyone or anything like that. Everyone here is seriously cool with games of any stripe. (And I have a great love for oMage and nMage.) I agree with you that "working towards enlightenment/power", for me at least, is one of the more core threads of the what nMage is about.<br/><br/>Firstly, there's the simplest option of using the WW system and paring out / simplifying the rules you don't find necessary. (For example: just keep Spheres, Quint, Gnosis, Willpower, and the base Attributes, strip out any real damage system, and keep Skills / Merits / Flaws as freeform and supply some bonus dice at most. You'll need to modify some difficulty numbers to make basic tasks easier, but it should work out.) This might be the easiest if you have players already used to WW, but you may want something more.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I think there are some rules you can reuse wholesale, regardless of system. For example, the definition of what spheres do, how many spheres you need, etc. could be kept exactly intact and don't depend on system. Similarly, it's clear that vulgar magic should be harder than coincidental magic and more prone to complication (regardless of system). You could plug this stuff into most any light system, like PDQ or the Pool.<br/><br/>As for what system to use: <a href="http://www.crngames.com/the_shadow_of_yesterday/index" rel="nofollow">Shadow of Yesterday</a> (and it's setting-less version, <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/tsoy2/solar_system.html" rel="nofollow">The Solar System</a>) have cool, easily hackable setting-bits, and mechanisms for reflecting character change and evolution.<br/><br/>I'm not super-experienced with Sorceror, but given that it's focused on dysfunctional relationships and getting What You Want (i.e. Power) it could work. There's nothing like a freeform magic system built into Sorceror as is, and I don't think that'd be the right way to go. Instead, I'd just use the normal Lore stat to act like Gnosis (i.e. a stat to pump up as you pursue knowledge) and for performing most magical acts (constrained by the rules of Spheres, etc.), and use Demons as things that your character is effected by or uses in order to become stronger. So I think an ideal scenario is the Mages seeking out powerful artifacts (i.e. demons with Wants and Needs) that will strengthen their Lore or Will as they seek to increase their power. However, using Sorceror will gear things towards a certain kind of Mage story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99302/#Comment_99302" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T14:23:40+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  2:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've looked for the ideal Mage-alike for a long time with mixed results.

Select one descriptor with a -1 and one with a +1 to add variation in Power/Finesse/Resistance.<br/>2) Select 5 dots of additional descriptors that are broad. You will add these like skills, but they're very broad and can also represent a special passion or emotion, etc.<br/>3) Willpower is Mental+Social. Health is Physical + 5.

To hurt someone enough to impose a -1 penalty on dice rolls for the scene score 1 success. To knock somebody out of acting for the scene score successes= to Physical. To kill somebody, score successes = to Health. You can spend a Willpower to knock a condition up one step.<br/>7) Anything that affects people uses a similar scale, except that "death" can stand for imposing your will by whatever means. Subtract the applicable attribute from  "attacking" dice pools. Against the environment simply pick a number between 1 and 5 as the  penalty.<br/>8) A magical effect only works on one person or thing at sensory range unless a mage employs Style. Mages have a Style Capacity equal to Gnosis + *lowest* Arcanum. You recover these points every game session. A point of Style can affect an additional PC/central NPC target, a variable group or area (1 point=5 guys/a backyard, 10= a whole city), but you must back that point up with an equivalent expression of Style. Same for intensified range, duration and so on. Style takes time, resources, sacrifice or compels the play group proportional to the expenditure in points, rated on a 1-10 scale. A 1 point sacrifice is 50 bucks or a rabbit. A 10 point sacrifice is the kind of thing a bad guy does to summon Cthulhu on big gory altars.<br/>9) Style always impacts Wisdom, based on what it is and how it is used in equal proportion -- literally. Style increases and/or lowers Wisdom, as follows:<br/><br/>*Magic is foolish (magic spell punches a baby): subtract Style x.1 (10=1 Wisdom<br/>*Magic is wise(magic spell heals a baby): add Style x .1<br/>*Style is foolish(punches a baby to boost magic): subtract Style x .1<br/>*Style is wise(kisses a baby to boost magic): add Style x .1<br/><br/>Apply *all* circumstances. Doing good with a dark ritual may balance out. You can add a 1-5 point wiggle to represent the moral differences between ritual and result.<br/>10) Pick 6 dots of Arcana as usual. Orders are a descriptor that adds a die to spells that fit its mission/ethos.<br/><br/>That should do it. This system has several "handles" for theme-based systems, but doesn't make them necessary, so you don't have to make someone talk about his/her Sooper Special Story Mojo if they don't care or don't want to define it that way, but another character in the *same game* can define things by passion or story circumstance. <br/><br/>(This is supposed to be impossible, though, and may give you cancer. Or something.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99430/#Comment_99430" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T05:20:12+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  5:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well if people are mentioning their own games ...<br/><br/>Solipsist is still a work in progress (with a release date planned for the spring next year I think), but a lot of people's first reaction to reading the setting is that it is a lot like Mage, and Mage is certainly one influence on it (though not the only one). I'm not sure I buy that it is quite what you are looking for, but it can't hurt to see. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>You can find a PDF with the background and a draft version of the rules <a href="http://www.teuton.org/~stranger/GAMES/Solipsist_Extract.pdf" rel="nofollow">on my website</a> and there are discussions of various mechanical aspects going on at Collective Endeavour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Torleiv" title="Torleiv"><img alt="Torleiv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/2671/goyogplaythothif3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Torleiv">Torleiv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99601/#Comment_99601" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T16:21:14+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  4:21PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm grateful for game recommendations, and are looking into them (but being broke you must take care not to design an even better game before I get to pay for the ones existing)<br/>But concerning actual mods of mage Malcolm Sheppard just made my late night. It's exactly what I wanted when I thought Mage Garage! So unless it completely breaks down in play test, i think my gnostic-catholic-punk-mage is good to go.<br/>I'll just plunder some kicker/bang thoughts, and use something like the index card game testing just discussed (in other threads) for chargen and it'll be in heaven.<br/>and in case some one worries, i will let my players have a say.
