Psi*Run is a psi focused game that concentrates on character discovery, and of course Daniel Bayn's Wushu can be modified easily to do all sorts of psi, from a high-action point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/george" title="george"><img alt="george" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/george">george</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412732/#Comment_412732" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T21:26:37+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  9:26PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only specific requirement is that it's suited to games with many sessions.

Also the rest of the actual game system was kind of clunky.<br/><br/>In general, I don't think most RPGs treat "psychic powers" any differently than any other kind of special power, so pretty much any game with an effects-based power system (HERO, Wild Talents, etc) would do.  What about the psychics genre appeals to you?  The Chronicle/Akira/Carrie "uncontrolled telekinetic fury of the unsettled mind" bit, the Dead Zone/classic seance style "fragile people that see too much" thing, Scanners/X-Men "the future of humanity in a world that's not yet ready" or something different?<br/><br/>Hmm, now that I think about it, the common link in most of those stories is the power controlling the user, or at least having uncontrollable/undesirable side effects.  Psi*Run does that well (but it's more suited for one-shots), but this is also bringing Don't Rest Your Head to mind... and it's already about dreams, which is pretty close to the whole collective unconscious/psychic potential thing.  Bliss Stage is also close to that territory, though all the "action" takes place in dreams...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/george" title="george"><img alt="george" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/george">george</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412771/#Comment_412771" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T08:33:22+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  8:33AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have DRYH in the back of my mind as well.

I think they come at the same basic idea via slightly different methods.<br/><br/>Psi*Run uses Otherkind dice (as does Bliss Stage, actually), the gist of which is you get a die for each relevant factor in the roll, and then have to assign your successes and failures among those factors.  So pretty much everything is a two-edged sword, and to use a resource is to also risk harm to it, and very often your rolls aren't so much about pure success and failure as deciding which losses are more or less acceptable to you; "I'm fine with failing this mission if it means my uncle doesn't get put in the line of fire".  Or vice versa.<br/><br/>I'm less familiar with DRYH, but the way I recall it is having several different die pools all rolled together, and different things happen depending on which die pool rolled the highest overall, right?  So you have the same concept of "the final result is somewhat unpredictable and out of your control", but if only one pool can be treated as dominant, you don't get the "trouble spiking out along multiple paths on every roll" thing I think is interesting about Otherkind.  On the other hand, cutting down on those multiple possible results of every roll might make the game run a little smoother, since you don't have to wrack your brain to make sense of multiple crises every time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412775/#Comment_412775" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T08:56:40+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  8:56AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely go for DRYH, psychic powers without a toll on them are way too overpowered.

Instead of Nightmares, maybe a nefarious government agency is hunting the PCs. Or, maybe they are psychic because they have alien DNA and aliens are chasing them. Maybe both. That would be a fun game. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
