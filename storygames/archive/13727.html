I was with friends, playing a roleplaying game. It was a zombie apocalypse type situation. When my turn came around, the GM asked me what sort of zombies I liked best. "George Romero zombies" I replied, and he set up a scene with shambling old Romero zombies. Then it was another player's turn, and he asked the same question, and the player replied "28 Days Later rage zombies", and that is what he got. <br/><br/>But this wasn't the GM tailoring his adventure to the tastes of his players, making a world full of different zombies - we shared a distinct, coherent universe that only had one type of zombie. But that type was filtered through the lens of player preference. I woke up going "huh". <br/><br/>As far as I know we don't do this, or when we do it accidentally it is considered a failure worthy of retcon. Why is that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310552/#Comment_310552" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T04:55:02+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  4:55AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 4:59AM by Sebastian.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe because conversation is a kind of shared understanding, or an agreement on a set of standards, and an active disruption of that understanding, unless it's cumulative, breaches something important. Like, today I was talking to my girlfriend about the indefinite and definite article and I noticed how much agreement there needs to be between parties before articles change from isolated to shared experience. I'll explain that now, and then push the other point afterwards.<br/><br/>For example, you and your mum are walking down the street, and she starts a story. Look at these two quotes: "So, this morning I kissed a horse." "So, this morning I kissed the horse." In one context, your mum does not own a horse. Or, alternatively, in one context your mum recognises that <i>you do not understand</i> that she <i>does </i>own a horse. Whether we talk about something generally or specifically is not only determined by whether we are talking about something generic or specific, but also by whether the person we are talking to understands this also. The use of articles seems to be a way to negotiate a shared understanding of a _________.<br/><br/>Like an establishing shot.<br/><br/>So, maybe that's partly why the confusion of a shared world space is, for folks like me, a conversational taboo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310555/#Comment_310555" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T05:17:41+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  5:17AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to explore the <i>value </i>in that disorientation.

The pregnancy situation works because it's a <i>mystery</i> that works both on the player/spectator level and the character level. It's not a contradiction of <i>fictional facts</i>.<br/><br/>Imagine Montsegur 2010. Now we have paternity tests, we can prove who's the dad. We do the test...we can't keep claiming Garnier both is and isn't the father. We can keep it a secret, because maybe that's more interesting. We never reveal what the test really said (movies do it all the time). But if Garnier is and isn't the father, then we enter some sort of quantum state. We can claim that the test is inconclusive. Or maybe we can claim the kid has <i>two dads</i> and then we start playing in this crazy gonzo lynch dreamworld of unsettling possibilities.<br/><br/>I think you can make a game that does that and supports that and it could be super fun. But it's certainly not the default desired mode of play. <br/><br/>The jockeying over details reminds me of the FATE point economy for declarations. Universalis maybe.The sort of "<i> I drink a bottle of poison, but I pay a point and hey, it's actually not poison but grape juice, the poison is right here in this other bottle that I deftly replaced earlier.</i>" narrative twists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310577/#Comment_310577" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T07:18:24+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  7:18AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like the trick would be defining whose reality reigned supreme when they necessarily clashed.

The contrast between the narration from the conflicting realities, and the little moments when we had to describe the exact same events through both filters, were a source of great amusement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310585/#Comment_310585" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T07:45:00+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  7:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's super interesting to me - and has been for a while - what a vast quantity of information is utterly irrelevant to cooperative play, and how we build up elaborate imaginary worlds that are essentially isolated from one another.

Kyle, describe your character.<br/><br/>Kyle: I'm a dwarf with a bearskin cloak and a big axe. I'm ready, in case you make any sudden moves, but I'm not openly hostile.<br/><br/>DM: Ok, so you see a small figure all wrapped in up on some kind of furs with a nasty-looking axe. He glares at you suspiciously as you enter. What's your character look like again?<br/><br/>Me: I'm half-elven, but you can only see it in the tips of my ears and green eyes. I'm in serviceable mail, nothing too conspicuous, with a brown cloak and a bow over my back. My sword is drawn, obviously, but I stop when I see Kyle's guy.<br/><br/>DM: Kyle, you see a tall man, sword in hand, step into the room as if expecting a fight.<br/><br/>Then we would roleplay out our meeting, and so on. It was interesting because he always took players descriptions, which tended to be very matter-of-fact, and made them <i>more ambiguous</i>, and then tossed the ball back to us to run with. Because we were friends we always played out our meetings to be friendly in the end, because we had to get the party together, after all - but there were always opportunities to "misunderstand" the situation. <br/><br/>So I guess this is somewhat like Eppy's comment, but a less situation specific.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310591/#Comment_310591" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T08:05:53+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  8:05AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 8:09AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know how in Monkeydome the die roll tells you whether the scene is funny or serious?

But the minority that is shared, is enough to keep it all together. <br/><br/>A GM may say:<br/><br/>1. "city"<br/>2. "a city like NYC" <br/>3. or never even say "city" but imply it with "you hear honking from cars stuck in traffic, see tourists jay walking, walk past the shadow of the tallest building you've ever seen, smell sweat and sewers, and feel the street rumbling below as crowded subways rush by." <br/><br/>And it's very unlikely that everyone will actually imagine NYC. Even the people who actually live in NYC! There are a billion details unspecified. Mostly superficial but even seemingly important setting facts like time, season, day, and weather are glossed over. Often "where am I loosely", "why am I here", "what will help me get what I want" preoccupies many people's head space and we abstract everything else, ignore it, or fill in our own, often unshared, details.<br/><br/>TV even does this. Vancouver often acts as a stand in for major locations all over the world from Hong Kong to NYC to the North Pole. We get just enough details for just enough time to communicate the minimal essentials and then move on. Often people don't even remember most of the characters' names in the show they are watching BUT it can still be 100% emotionally engaging and satisfying... moments you will never forget but you focus on the bits you care about and abstract the rest.<br/><br/>I minored in Semiotics in college so I tend to over think this. And although my studies are likely a bit outdated now, from what I remember, even our physical input organs abstract information. Our eyes see a combination of color and b&amp;w dots and then our brains blur it all together to form a 100% color image. We ignore superfluous details all the time (just think about how much advertising information gets thrown in our faces non stop, we have to shut out mass amounts of information just to keep focused). And even when we absorb details, often our mind alters that information to serves its own purpose. Many people's memories aren't completely trust worthy. People will sometimes remember what they want to and liberally, often without intending it, rewrite history in their own heads to fit their own preconceptions and agendas. Even how we rationalize information is driven by our emotions, not the facts. <br/><br/>When I GM, I work under the idea that 90% of what I'm imagining isn't shared by anyone else and vice versa. And it doesn't have to, for the game to be successful. So I try my best not to input my vision into people's heads but work with theirs, even if everyone is contradicting each other. I will try to describe around the details they are imagining without contradicting them. And when those contradictions happen, I use it as an opportunity to add twists. You thought the zombie was slow, and you thought it was fast... you're both right and here's why... and I introduce a twist to smooth it over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310596/#Comment_310596" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T08:51:12+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  8:51AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 9:19AM by Graham.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>I think we're just talking about different sides of the coin.

Sure, we could <i>say</i> we need a basic level of agreement to run games, but is it actually true? We contest many things about games: who has authority, what the setting is, whether something is a roleplaying game, whether that dice rolled accurately, whether we should actually follow the rules.<br/><br/>So where is the agreement? Could you define a single thing, in the Shared Imagined Space, that everyone completely agrees on?

It was a superhero setting with an overwhelming organization of high-powered entities that 'governed' superhumans so the rest of the world didn't have to.  It's leadership was descended from the Greek Gods, and had an appropriately imperious 'style' of leadership.  Newly-discovered superhumans were given to the organization to be taught to use their powers...<br/><br/>One character's experience of this was described to him as 'English Boarding School' style hazing and benign neglect.<br/>Another character, with a rebellious nature, had her time with the organization described like Cinderella's treatment by her step-sisters; constant brutal labor punctuated by random, senseless punishment.<br/><br/>My character encountered a group of runaway teen supers living on the streets of NYC, hiding out from the authorities.  I perceived them as sort of 'junior X-men', protecting street people and rescuing other teens with powers from the organization.<br/>When the character with the 'English Boarding School' view of that organization encountered the same group of teen supers, he saw them as a predatory group of hyper-gangbangers terrorizing the neighborhood and recruiting super-criminals.<br/><br/>These differing perceptions of the same phenomena were delivered to us via emails or in one-on-one gaming outside of the whole-group game sessions, for the most part.  The in-game 'reality' wasn't fungible or mutable, but the GM's intention was to push the conflicts and struggles between the PCs by playing to our differing world views.  It worked wonderfully, until we finally figured out how he was doing it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  After that, we began to distrust our own character's perceptions, and fact-check everything we saw.<br/><br/>The technique provided a richness to the gaming experience that I had seldom encountered previously.  The differences in the PCs perception of 'objective reality' that we had encountered mirrored what seems to really happen when people unconsciously 'edit' their memories of events.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310605/#Comment_310605" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T09:38:56+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  9:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this is the same phenomenon you're talking about, but I really enjoy the play experience of when I'm able to move back and forth between my character's perspective, an audience member's outsider perspective, and if I'm really lucky, the perspective of a player who isn't me. In the first case it's a fictional creation, in the second it's the performance comprised of many fictional creations all interacting, and in the third it's me guessing what the real person is experiencing (and not knowing for sure if they're keyed into their creation or the stage itself at that moment).<br/><br/>I think also one of the greatest GMing tools one can ever develop is being able to forcibly move between these perspectives and reconcile them all into a coherent whole. It's a poor GM who simply cannot connect with how the players are connecting with both their own character experiences, and how the stage looks from the outside. I strongly suspect most traditional frustrated-novelist GMs are mostly keyed into the action on the stage, at the expense of never empathizing with the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310610/#Comment_310610" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T10:20:00+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 10:20AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aren't there games out there that let players "bid" to change certain elements?

Usually one character was afflicted by a hallucination.  He would try to kill the other PCs, while they tried to subdue him without hurting him, or some such.  The experience was usually disappointing.  An initial "Hey, neat!" wore off as the burden of communicating and tracking two sets of information taxed everyone's brains.<br/><br/>I think it could be done, but might require some very specific procedures about who says what when.<br/><br/>Alternatively, telling 4 overlapping stories, but taking turns to do so, is easy, and having those stories' facts/tones fail to line up doesn't seem hard.  It seems to fly in the face of our general desire to unify, tie up, and make sense of things, though, so a clear payoff would help.  If I get input in the 3 other ways in which my character is explored in your scenes, that might do it.  A kind of "alternate universe me" appeal.<br/><br/>Or a fictional conceit in which 3 of the 4 characters are projecting (a la new BSG Cylons), and play resolves whose reality is real...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310618/#Comment_310618" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T10:49:31+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 10:49AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 10:50AM by Teataine.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Seriously, why are we uncritically accepting the idea that gaming is about agreement?</blockquote>\nI'm just going "huh?" now here, Graham.

My protagonist is pregnant, because that puts her in lots of funny situations, but during your noir scenes she isn't, because noir protagonists aren't pregnant (well, besides Marge Gunderson).

It reminds me of the jeepform <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/drunk/" rel="nofollow">Drunk</a>, in which there are three characters and three players. Each player plays one of the characters at any given time, but each different combination of players (Player A the mother, B the father, C the child; then A the father, C the mother, etc) has a different take on each of the players. In one set I'll play the long-suffering mother, the angry-addicted father, the guilt-ridden child; while your set might be the super-critical mother, the easy going father and so on.<br/><br/>It gives you a shifting view on the story, which matches how contradictory people can be in real life.

Our game takes place in New York City, the very same New York City no matter who is narrating, but the ground truth is going to waver a bit depending on who holds the talking stick. Cards fly; stickers stick. I actually think shifting gears from very broad concepts like "fairyland" to "noir-land" would be <i>easier and not as cool.</i> <br/><br/>So your Peter Pan example - the whole game is set there, but mine is a little bit darker, and yours is slightly stupider, and Emily's is just <i>that </i>much more political. We learn how much and in what ways in play, as we challenge our assumptions about the baseline. pretty soon there are a ton of divergent points and they become distinct and then things get really fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310634/#Comment_310634" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T11:49:25+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 11:49AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An old game called "Psychosis" had each character's perceptions filtered by their individual psychosis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310636/#Comment_310636" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T12:10:25+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 12:10PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 12:12PM by Graham.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor, still no!

In it, you played a kid outside on a snow day, trying to defend your snow fort from the neighborhood bullies. You could if you wanted summon up your imaginary snow monster friends to help you, but the way the mechanics worked it wasn't clear just how (fictionally) real that imaginary help was. As I think Mike Holmes pointed out, it was possible to be playing the game and imagining that that your PC's imaginary monster did in fact "really" come and save your fort, while someone else imagined that your PC was simply imagining the imaginary help, standing amid the ruins of your in-fictional-fact destroyed fort.<br/><br/>And I remember talking to a fellow player after <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=20450.0" rel="nofollow">a badly railroaded D&amp;D convention game</a> several years ago who was not as badly upset as I was, because <i>the game in his head</i> was cooler than the one at the table--in other words, he had been able to imagine that some of the silly at-the-table stuff the DM had pulled had some interesting in-the-fiction explanations. As a concept, I thought that was an interesting idea: "The game in my head is awesome!"<br/><br/>Another example may be <a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html" rel="nofollow">PowerKill</a> by John Tynes, wherein at the end of each session of a "normal role-playing game" there is a level of meta-play where the GM takes the role of a psychiatric counselor treating a bunch of normal people whose delusions lead them to believe that they are wizards or vampires or what-have-you and commit horrific crimes that in the delusions are perfectly justified. The idea is that what you thought you were imagining as cool and awesome at the time was in fact psychotic and sad.<br/><br/>My point is that there has been some exploration of the idea that the consensus of the imaginary that we regard as axiomatically necessary may not in fact be so--but not a lot of exploration. So that's a cool thing to do. I also think Graham is saying something interesting (in the sense of thought-provoking) when he argues that in the tension produced in the interaction between minds imagining things differently--different loci of make-believe, if you like--lies some creative essence of role-playing. That's neat. The point isn't to get to agreement or reach consensus; it's to stage an encounter between dissenting interpretations. To the extent that such differences get "resolved," they stop being interesting. I see a parallel to a paper I wrote where I concluded that the essence of dialogue is a kind of "xenomancy"--reading the signs in the stranger, in other words, and presenting oneself as other as a resource in interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310659/#Comment_310659" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T13:39:24+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  1:39PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>I concluded that the essence of dialogue is a kind of "xenomancy"--reading the signs in the stranger, in other words, and presenting oneself as other as a resource in interaction.</blockquote>This is definitely one of my favorite versions of "make your friends cooler".  <br/><br/>If I understand you right, Bill, it's also one of the keys of playing pretend as kids.  When my vision that I'm the best lightsaber-wielder ever and can beat anybody collides with your vision that you're the best sharpshooter ever and can beat anybody, we each need to volunteer resistance that is <i>interactive</i>; otherwise, we literally can't play together.  "But what if I shoot you from far away!" challenges me to develop my vision of lightsaber-wielding in a way that "Nuh-uh, I kill you!" doesn't.  But this doesn't mean that any real consensus is being formed!<br/><br/>I'm always curious about what happened in someone else's head during a shared RPG session.  A means of teasing that out in play rather than through lengthy postgame analysis could be quite fun.  Specifically, a system to take note of when players' imaginations diverge, and explore that, would be really exciting.<br/><br/>Example:  as I'm narrating, the other players are placing markers on an adjective chart describing their vision of the scene, and when one of them really surprises me, I pause the fiction and then they take over.  Clumsy, but I hope it illustrates the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310660/#Comment_310660" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T13:44:28+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  1:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 3:08PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, I toyed with the meta-meta a little in <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/fortress_of_woe/fortress_of_woe_1.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fortress of Woe</a>, where you play gamers playing games and have two character sheets, one for your character and one for <i>their </i>character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310661/#Comment_310661" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T13:44:53+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  1:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 1:45PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ... and I guess my example would actually dovetail with Eppy's idea of noting factual incongruence, if we expanded "facts" to include aesthetic qualities like mood, style, etc.  <br/><br/>The adjective-dropping would just be a way of keeping an eye out for incongruence.

If I'm playing the Jedi, and I'm <i>really listening</i> to you, I recognize what you've said while playing the sharpshooter to be a challenge to my world-view that I have to deal with somehow, and the source of that challenge is exactly the "otherness" of the different role you've taken on. At the same time, it is probably not the case that any challenge you offer will compel me to change my view that I am essentially unbeatable. "I deflect the bullet with the lightsaber blade; it does not harm me!" I say. You remain unconvinced, and say so. "But the bullet is traveling faster than you can perceive!" you tell me. "But no human being can conceivably move fast enough to deflect a bullet!" You remain convinced that a well-placed shot to the head will take me out for good; I stand firm in my allegiance to the physics of George Lucas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310665/#Comment_310665" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T14:16:00+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  2:16PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 2:17PM by ccreitz.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>I'm in.

This sounds like it could be a great experiment for you and I am jealous I can't be there.<br/><br/>But I think I've played this game already, and it maybe wasn't fun? Bear with me for a mini-AP here. In a <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> game, the players didn't understand why their horrific, but mundane, sociopathic behavior, and their mere exposure to a few monsters, were drawing SAN checks. Their understanding of what was going on in their characters' lives, and my understanding, had diverged at some point. Session ended. I pulled out the manilla envelope labeled "CASE FILES", put everyone's character sheets in it. "I'm glad you're all here for our group session, because I think that we can't make progress in understanding your condition unless we make it together..." and we played "Power Kill" for a while. We talked about how knowing Terrible Secrets makes it impossible to relate to people who don't know them, and the resulting isolation. We talked about how you can't always explain the blood in your car. So - we had fictional consensus for a while to begin the CoC scenario, but then it fell apart in the middle there, and stayed apart through the first half of the Power Kill session, until I had communicated my motivations more clearly (but still within the enlarged fiction), at which point everyone shared an understanding, if not a fictional goal exactly, but we had licensed that via narrator unreliability. The first part was the most fun, and the last part was kind of fun and did give us some resolution, but the middle parts were frustrating and eroded our trust that our contributions to the SIS were being honored and extended (although we wouldn't have said it that way at the time, of course).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310666/#Comment_310666" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T14:24:55+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  2:24PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>the middle parts were frustrating and eroded our trust that our contributions to the SIS were being honored and extended</blockquote>Crap.  That makes total sense.  "But it's <i>not</i> like that!" is a serious challenge to a hobby built around appreciating what each player introduces into a shared fiction.  <br/><br/>For this to work, we'd need a way to communicate, "That is really cool!  And so now I'm gonna run with it in a new direction!"  As opposed to, y'know, "I don't like that.  I can do better."

Or if we'd known that I'd pull a framing device out of my bag beforehand. "Power Kill" contains multitudes.<br/><br/>So the thing that PK added to our session was that we got to play a game as the metagame. The Eppy/Jason proposal above has elements of that idea - there are tokens that remind you what elements of the multi-fiction you're engaged with, for instance, so there is a game structure that sits at the next level of description "up" from the base fiction.

I was an Imperial Intelligence dude.<br/><br/>However, the staff was idiots and hated everyone but their pet characters.<br/><br/>So I would be assigned a mission and try to do some very basic stuff like checking the computers in our Space Police State to see if they had a wife or child I could kidnap and torture.<br/><br/>No, the staff said, you can't do that. If you can't find it out "in roleplay", you can't find it out.<br/><br/>So I incorporated this into my conception of the character. What kind of guy would be an Imperial Intelligence agent completely unable to use even the most basic resources of his job?<br/><br/>Oh shit, I thought. <i>This is the guy who said the Death Star was a big fucking waste of money.</i><br/><br/>So I inserted that into my background. My guy became the guy who said "Fear won't keep the local systems in line, greed will do the job, check out my plan of bribery and theft." and was outmaneuvered and politically castrated by the Tarkins, he managed to keep his head attached to his neck but was removed from his top advisory position and stuck in a worthless job with strict orders to everyone not to help him with anything.  Especially once he was proven right and the Death Star proved to have an operational lifetime measured in <i>hours</i>.  After all, they might forgive you for being wrong, but never for being right.<br/><br/>From then on, whenever my guy was given a mission, he would just wander outside, grab some poor dope off the street, torture him into a confession, plant evidence, and send him off to the spice mines.  Because after all, if they really wanted the mission done, wouldn't they give it to someone who they actually supported?<br/><br/>It was brilliant. My guy spent his time getting drunk and smirking about how right he was about everything to all the staffers' pet favorite characters, and insulting them. <br/><br/>My friends called this "making lemonade".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
