Um. Not sure if there's a rule about that.]<br/><br/>This is a call for playtesters for my disaster movie roleplaying game, Disaster Strikes!<br/><br/>DS! is a game about a major disaster, like an earthquake, terrorist attack or zombie plague outbreak, and the actions of ordinary heroes who fight to save innocent lives in the face of it. It's designed to simulate disaster movies like the Towering Inferno, Volcano! and Aliens. (In this context, Aliens is a disaster movie, because it's about an uncontrollable threat which our heroes can only desperately try to contain or flee from.)<br/>\xa0<br/>The game can be played light-hearted and silly (think Shaun of the Dead) or tense and serious (The Poseidon Adventure, maybe.) Either way, it's a fast-paced and deadly game where there is a real possibility of failure. The game is designed to tolerate player character death \u2013 even when you die, there's stuff for you to do.<br/>\xa0<br/>The game is designed to be played as a one-shot, of around four hours in length. It works with 2-6 people, but is best with 4.<br/>\xa0<br/>The game is now ready for beta playtesting. I've already playtested it in a safe environment, with considerable success. (And, indeed, received some helpful input from people on this forum.) But no game should be published without first being tested by someone other than the designer. So this is a call for playtesters. If you'd like to take part, please drop me a PM, or leave a comment here, and I will send you a playtest pack.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402270/#Comment_402270" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-31T11:06:08+00:00" title="December 31, 2012 11:06AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you tell us a little more?

On a par with Dogs in the Vineyard, maybe. It uses playing cards rather than dice, and makes use of the suits and face cards to do interesting stuff.<br/><br/>It has a GM, but significant elements of player input to the creative process. During the first act, the game is effectively GMless as the group sets up the story, before the disaster proper kicks off, but in the main part of the game (acts 2 and 3) the GM drives the disaster and throws challenges at the players.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the group create a disaster and a location for the disaster to happen, as well as a protagonist for each player. Each protagonist has four stats used for tackling in-game challenges and a special ability which allows you to break the rules in some way or other.<br/><br/>In-game, the focus is on rescuing bystanders from the disaster and, ultimately, either defeating it or escaping it. As time passes the players either get on top of the disaster and form a plan to overcome/escape it, or they lose control and have to form such a plan on the fly as the disaster rages out of control.<br/><br/>Erm. Is that enough detail? Any other questions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402332/#Comment_402332" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T05:15:40+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  5:15AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To give you a better idea about crunch, the game is 36 A5 pages including front and back covers, and of that about 9 pages could be characterised as being focused on mechanics (not counting two pages on character gen and the opening 4 pages or so that provide an overview of the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402377/#Comment_402377" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T13:27:30+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  1:27PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and it's zero-prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
