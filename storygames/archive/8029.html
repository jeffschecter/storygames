I don't usually bother with discussing play with the group - I sermonize and explain rules and theory for what I'm doing (I'm good at speaking theory intelligibly), but it's all done in the context of real play of something that we've decided to play. If the game we play doesn't seem to work for individuals or the group we might switch to something else, or a player might drop out, but overall there is no democratic group hug in the process anywhere.<br/><br/>The way we choose what to play has been modeled on boardgaming: we have a bunch of options at hand each given session, and we choose between them. For example, lately we've tended to mostly have the choices of "playing Zombie Cinema", "playing Eero's D&amp;D campaign", "playing Diplomacy" and "playing some random lighter boardgames". Then we just go through these with whoever happens to be playing, pick one and go into it. Any Creative Agenda discussion is subsumed into the choice of game, there is no negotiation of "what we're going to do" after the choice is made. Whoever is the rules expert (usually me) just tells the others what they're supposed to be doing in this particular game, and that's that.<br/><br/>The benefit in this approach is that it saves everybody from having to verbalize the heavy theoretical underpinnings of play - we just need to know that we like the procedures and priorities of D&amp;D, say, or that we don't, and then we can play or not play that game. Of course this requires only having CA-coherent games on the big list, but that's not been a problem for me - I wouldn't suggest playing something for which I hadn't already figured out how it's supposed to be played.<br/><br/>I don't know that this sort of approach would feel right for others, but if you want to try it, approach the situation by grabbing a half dozen good and varied games and going with them into the negotiations. Presenting a complete game allows you to prepackage everything from the details of color to the operative reward cycles into one clear package for the group, which makes it easier to choose how and what to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177266/#Comment_177266" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T07:26:12+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  7:26AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talking about past gaming experiences, even experiences with other groups, can be very illustrative.

It's like saying "I have this great idea for a jungle cat warrior with tentacles to shoot out poison." and then your GM says "Oh, well, they don't have that in this game."<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oni<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thirdeyegames.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdeyegames.net</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177274/#Comment_177274" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T09:22:08+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  9:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I'm gonna commit major time to a game, like months of play, then I need more than five minutes of conversation to figure out what I'm committing to. I've tried the "sit down and talk about it" approach and that doesn't work with a lot of gamers, unfortunately. They don't know what they want--at least in my experience. They say that they want X, or even that Y will be fine when you suggest it, but then they avoid X and Y during the game and pursue Z, which you don't care about at all. <br><br>But I'm not bitter.<br><br>Maybe go to your friends with two or three pretty well-defined choices, all of which interest you. Sell them. Let consensus pick what you do. Maybe they'll suggest door number four, but at least you got discussion going.<br><br/>To get this out of theoreticals, Ryan, can you get more specific about what you want?

All this stuff isn't guaranteed to work, but has a good shot of getting some discussion going, I think.<br/><br/>So: present your game pitches (if you're doing that) with the agenda of play clearly outlined. Not in theory terms, but in terms everyone understands and can relate to. For instance, if you wanted to move into more Gamist territory, you might say, "How about a game where you try to make the most capable characters you can, and see if they stand up to the challenges I prepare? Maybe they're adventurers sent into dangerous situations, and then we'll find out if they can make it through alive." For a Narrativist-type game, you might prepare a bit about the setting that really really heavily focuses on some Premise (in the Forge sense). Seeing your players' reactions to these materials might give you some idea--do their eyes light up? Do they seem excited about one option more than another?<br/><br/>To get information out of _them_, ask them to describe their favourite moments, from past games, campaigns, etc. "Hey, we've played together for a while. What were your favourite bits? I'd like to know, so we can try to put together our next game so we can have as many moments like that as possible." Also, you can ask them to describe their least favourite moments, but they might really hesitate there. <br/><br/>Ask them to name one (or two, or three) things they would like to see in a future game. That could give you some idea of what to focus on, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177280/#Comment_177280" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T09:52:38+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  9:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For stuff like your game-with-no-name, can you get them to agree to a series of one-shot playtests, then get their feedback afterwards?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177282/#Comment_177282" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T09:53:52+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  9:53AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Seeing your players' reactions to these materials might give you some idea--do their eyes light up?
