All of the<br/>elements are all related together through various means.  Somewhere in that network of stuff is one or more conflicts, which forms the "what happens" part of the game.<br/><br/><strong>Addressing the Situation</strong> is taking in-character actions in response to the conflicts presented by the situation.  The idea is that whatever you do, it will be in line with what you enjoy in games.  So if you like hard-hitting personal drama, your address will be full of angst and hard moral choices.  If you like fiddly tactical challenges, your address will be what combination of gear/skill/position/whatever you use.<br/><br/>The above two aren't 'mine' but my definitions are slightly off of their canonical and original definitions.<br/><br/>Now, in order to play a game in which you get to address a situation, there needs to be a situation to address.  So at some point the situation needs to be created.  This can happen before, during, or in-between sessions of roleplay.  Then, in the course of play, stuff always ends up getting added: through roleplaying, the players show/invent new facets and new repercussions of the situation than was originally planned.  This can be "I hate Mister Big Bad because he reminds me of my father!" or something as simple as, "But if the lich-dragon rises, he'll crush the poor goblin village at the mouth of the cave!" (and the DM is all, "wait, what?  um, okay...").  Anyway, the situation changes, develops, deepens, whatever.<br/><br/>Often times -- perhaps, what, 90% of the time? -- the players' address of the situation entails an attempt to change the situation.  You want to remove the Big Bad from power, you want to stop the occult ritual, you want to make amends with Ma Humphrey, whoever she is.  Now, in some circles simply the attempt to change things and the means by which the attempt is made is the important bit, regardless of outcome.  The important thing is that you tried and how you tried: that's what says something about you, that allows you to exercise those brain-muscles.  But, being that we are cause-effect monkeys, we want to see how it turns out.  We need that denouement.<br/><br/>So the question is: given that all of this is, at root, "changing the situation," why do we treat them differently?  What is gained by having situation creation procedures that are separate from situation development procedures that are themselves different from situation address and resolution procedures?  These things are all <em>functionally</em> the same thing, but are they <em>experientially</em> different, and thus require different rule sets?  Or is it just convenience?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83208/#Comment_83208" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T10:42:02+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:42AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Might do as well to ask why have different mechanics for character creation and character advancement.

Much like how buying a hammer &amp; saw doesn't help me build my house, but without them building my house is harder.  But getting those tools isn't getting my house built.  And stealing those tools doesn't undo any house building I've already done, it just means it'll be harder to do more (or possibly to protect my house from undoing).<br/><br/>Getting tools = adding or altering situation<br/>Doing work = addressing situation.<br/><br/>I make the difference because I see where mechanics can shift in tone &amp; intent with those topics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83345/#Comment_83345" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T16:14:35+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  4:14PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, but are we agreed that, fundamentally, you can't use the same mechanics for the entirety of a situation?

What about, though, when you're using tools to shop for more tools?  What if you, as in Paul's famous Nobilis game, liberate Tibet simply to get the attention of the Noble of Storms?  And this underscores another problem with the shopping/working analogy: <em>how you go about shopping</em> is an important choice, right?  I mean, to get Storms' attention, you could capture that renegade Borealis or you could liberate Tibet -- are you more comfortable/interested/capable working more in the mythic world or more in the real world?<br/><br/>I mean, I can see the <em>tone</em> that you're identifying, Ryan, but I don't think that that tone is what distinguishes address from not-address.  Increasingly, I'm seeing any attempt to change the situation as an address.  Which makes me wonder why the very creation of the situation isn't an address.<br/><br/>Like: you're making a situation that is "about" totalitarianism, to be crude about it.  You get to a point where you <em>could</em> say, "I'm done, this is ready for play."  Or, you could say, "Man, what this really needs is a sympathizer to put a human face on the totalitarian regime."  And then you add that to what you've already got on the page.  How is that <em>not</em> an address to the theme of totalitarianism?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
