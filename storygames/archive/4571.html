Except the movie isn't really about that.  The movie is about Elizabeth coming to terms with the isolation of her position, and letting herself live a little even if it means making herself vulnerable.  The pirates are important only insomuch as one of them makes for a romantic interest.  The armada is important only insomuch as it makes for a sword of damocles hanging over her head.  There is literally no decision that Elizabeth makes on screen that has any effect on the invasion.  Rather, the decisions that Elizabeth makes all regard how she deals with her position and how she interacts with the love triangle with the pirate.  The invasion isn't the plot of the movie; the invasion is the pretense for the movie.<br/><br/>In the thread, Merten is talking about a game where his GM-prepped plot took a back seat to the players' interactions, and became (at the risk of paraphrasing too hard) the pretense for play.  That is, it was the reason that this set of player characters were together in a pressured situation, but the "real" story was how the player characters interacted in that situation.<br/><br/>It seems to me like Merten's description of play sounds a lot like how the movie plays out.  The invasion is not the plot of the movie.  So too, the "GM's Plot" is not, on further examination, the actual plot of the story being told in the game.  It is, instead, merely its pretense -- the reason that the characters are thrown together in the pressured situation.<br/><br/>Is this a useful way to approach GM prep?  How would this work if it was done intentionally and explicitly?  Does this require players to make more interconnections among themselves to serve as fodder for the real story?<br/><br/>Now, in all truth, my first reaction to this proposition goes along the lines of, "That kind of sucks for the GM that he's not actually involved in the story, just the pretense" or "Wouldn't the whole experience be richer if the stuff that the GM did was intimately engaged with the story?"  On further reflection, it seems that this is a very easy and highly portable way to approach a game.  Perhaps it has a little less payout, but it seems like it requires a <strong>lot</strong> less investment.<br/><br/>Thoughts?  Does this resonate with anybody?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103439/#Comment_103439" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T10:30:14+00:00" title="October 17, 2007 10:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts on that kind of game would be to have the GM actually engage in the play that is the actual story and have the "plot" then be controlled by all the players.

There was a GM but mainly for purposes of creating problems the group had to solve.  The mechanics involved tracking compatibilities and incompatibilities of personality among the characters.  Every conflict involved one roll with a two pass interpretation.  The first pass determined if you were even capable of cooperating and the second pass involved determining success.  If I were to revisit it I would remove the restriction on character behavior.  You could always co-operate or not but the influence of personality tension would act simply as a penalty or bonus on the conflict at hand.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103466/#Comment_103466" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T12:10:35+00:00" title="October 17, 2007 12:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did a little more thinking.

This is "underbelly play" as mentioned in the gaming-the-book thread, in the sense that these are the "little people" - their decisions and actions don't materially affect the overall course of big events, <b>but are still deeply significant to the characters themselves</b>.<br/><br/>Pretty much any story of ordinary soldiers (or civilians) during a war would work for this. The Elizabeth example is unusual in that here is someone who is the Queen (and an absolute monarch, pretty much), who would normally be in the "changing the world" role but here isn't.<br/><br/>As much as I'm in love with "characters change the world", I can see how this alternative has huge possibilities...<br/><br/>Anything big beyond ordinary people's control (war, natural disaster, massive social change) would work as a backdrop, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103479/#Comment_103479" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T13:26:17+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  1:26PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgive me, this gets a tad ranty later on in the post...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it happens, I once ran a game set in 1492, shortly after the taking of Grenada, the completion of the Reconquista. It involved every major figure from the day, all attending a feast being thrown by the Spanish Monarchs. As such, Catharine of Aragon was there, as a girl, of course, and people from England sniffing her out as a potential suitor for the English Monarch, etc. Colombus was there, hat in hand, Machiavelli, Thomas De Torquemada... well the list goes on and on, and the scenario was designed to take into account the potential world-changing political events of the day. It was very much a scenario of "If you had been there, how might you have altered history at this critical juncture of events?" <br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, there were many "plots" in motion. But, again, this is a use of the term "plot" to mean, "The plans that people have." As opposed to it's meaning as, "The course of the story as determined as a chain of important decisions made by the protagonists." <br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as people keep conflating these, there's going to be confusion. If, in fact, the "metaplot" is simply presented as background, with foreground action occuring that informs the actual course of the narrative, then this is functionally identical to the GM saying, "There is air around your character." That's not to say that it can't be reacted to, or inform character decisions, but in no more forceful a way than the player saying, "I take a deep breath of this air." <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question about "Plot" will always come down to whether or not the players are given some actual power to adjust the flow of significant events, "significant" here meaning ones that they're interested in adjusting. The player doesn't want to have control (likely) of whether or not there happens to be air around his character, and so will not be disappointed if the GM takes care of that detail. He may well be dissapointed, some players, if he finds out that it didn't matter whether or not he insulted the baron, that the GM had decided to have the Baron send him on the quest anyhow. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, where to draw this line sounds tricky to some, but it's really not that difficult. Moreover, you'll make mistakes and step on toes sometimes. But as long as you're focusing on giving the player the ability to create "plot," you'll do just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo all of these posts about, "I control the plot by setting up a situation" are missing the point, IMO. That is, they're all just fine sorts of play, and none of them constitute the problematic "GM Control of Plot." <br/>\n<br/>\nLet's just go back to the simpler term, Railroading. Are you railroading the players? No? Then you're not doing the bad version of "GM Controls Plot." You thought that "GM Controls Plot" meant something else that people thought was bad? Well, is anyone out there saying it means something else negative? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe controversy, if there is any, comes about because there are people who claim that both the GM and players can simultaneously control the plot. If when saying that, you mean that you sometimes control some stuff, and sometimes the players control where play goes, then that's not "GM Control of Plot," that's "GM Sharing the Plot" which is what everyone advocates. The point being that if the GM has full control of the plot, and the players do not, and the players would like some control of the plot, then we have a problem. Which seems pretty non-controversial to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon't like that "GM Controls the Plot" phrasing? Use another one then. But it's a complete straw man to assume that there's anyone out there who is against the GM having some control over the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs setting up a cool situation for the players to play through a "useful way to approach prep?"

I am aware that there are many meanings of the word 'plot'.  Give the OP a sliver of charitable reading, man, and see that I'm not conflating different meanings, I'm juxtaposing them, and trying to tease out an interesting interaction between different meanings.<br/><br/>Yes, zombie movies work like this.  My proposition is: your run-of-the-mill baseline "Dungeons and Dragons" game (where you roll dice twice an hour and consider this an accomplishment) <em>also works like this</em>.  The "plot" of such a game is not the story being told; it's just the pretense for the characters to be involved and create the actual story.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to address underbelly play, although that is somewhat similar in that it is way more explicit.  It's a slightly different thing, though.<br/><br/>I'm saying: you know all those people who are all, "The GM controls the plot!" like Jason hates?  Maybe they mean, "The GM controls the pretense."<br/><br/>John, to me, premise is one step 'up' from pretense.  Pretense does not engage with the actual story at all except as a backdrop.  It provides a world of events to <em>act in</em>.  Premise does engage with the real story, pushing and prodding players to act.  It provides a world of events to <em>respond to</em>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103535/#Comment_103535" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T19:34:23+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  7:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>The Uprising is the "pretense" (still don't like this word) for all the drama among the youths.</blockquote>\nI suspect the word Joshua actually meant was "pretext," if that helps at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103538/#Comment_103538" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T19:52:15+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  7:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I actually meant pretense, but pretext is close, too.

I feel like I found those and picked them up, eagerly, for my own use, but I had no hand in creating them and don't control them so much as I (and the other players) select them like tools from a tool rack.<br/><br/>I agree there's a whole lot of different levels of things going on here:<br/><br/>The shape of the story in general via genre, convention or format (this can be as broad as 'someone gets married in the end!' or as narrow as 'the hero will refuse the first call to adventure' or 'the problem will be solved in 42 on-screen minutes')<br/><br/>The specific elements of the events of the story within that shape<br/><br/>The specific actions of the characters within and through those events<br/><br/>The specific attributes of those characters that drive them to take the actions that they do<br/><br/>It's pretty easy to get these things jumbled, picking out a word for each of them is hard if, like me, you're not trained in literature in any way other than, um, reading a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103558/#Comment_103558" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T23:19:52+00:00" title="October 17, 2007 11:19PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ack!

The player doesn't want to have control (likely) of whether or not there happens to be air around his character, and so will not be disappointed if the GM takes care of that detail. He may well be dissapointed, some players, if he finds out that it didn't matter whether or not he insulted the baron, that the GM had decided to have the Baron send him on the quest anyhow.<br/></blockquote>\nI think I agree with the above. But to put it in my words, one person's plot is another person's premise - another person's premise is another person's plot. If the GM has rock solid control of elements of the imagined game world that players don't care about, then it's premise. If the GM has rock solid control of elements of the imagined game world that the players would like to have control, or at least influence over, then there's potential for problems.<br/><br/>However, I think there is a link to the notion of whether "We are all creating a story together" versus "We each have our own separate stories, with some elements in common." In the latter paradigm, the GM could have sweeping, profound control over the setting, NPCs, etc and I as a player might view all this stuff as background fluff  while I focus on the internal mental state of one particular character (the PC) . In the former paradigm, however, we all make an attempt to be on the "same page" telling the "same story" so there's maybe more danger of there being a problem with one person having sweeping absolute control over any aspect of the shared imagined world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
