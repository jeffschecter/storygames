Its familiar enough that if you\u2019ve played a D6 game you can play HELLAS. The dice system being used was created by Ken Burnside and modified heavily by myself to fit the genre<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is a combination of Pendragon, Spelljammer and a nod to Agon<br/>\n<br/>\nPedragon: because of the generational aspect of the charcters. If you play a campaign of HELLAs you will not play the same character at the end of the game as the one you start with. The game spans 100 years and a great war and infestation that changes the Hellens way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpelljammer: I really hated this game but after Andy mentioned it I thought about it and realized that he was right. It does share aspects of Spelljammer in the sense that it\u2019s a fantasy space opera with various races<br/>\n<br/>\nAgon: I was working on the idea when Agon came out. Agon is not a direct inspiration but it has informed some of the choices I\u2019ve made when writing it. Agon also has an aesthetic that I\u2019m in love with but have to stay away from.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does have a few parts that are completely foreign to other D6 games<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Destiny</b><br/>\nEvery character decides what his destiny will be at character creation. This is the players built in way of telling the Gm what he wants to do and what he\u2019s working towards in the game. If he works toward his destiny then he gets bonus dice if the directly relate to that endeavor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Disadvantages</b><br/>\nIn most games you buy disads that give you pints to buy other skill or advantages. In HELLAS you must take three disadvantage; One Relationship, one Internal, and one External disadvantage. You have 5 dice to distribute among these disad. The dice are bonus dice the hero can use for what ever they want. They way they acces these ice is by activating the disad. The amount f dice in the disad determine how bad the disad is. A Gm may activate the disad but only with the players approval. If the player doesn\u2019t want the disad activate he must pay character points to stave off the effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fate</b><br/>\nThis randomly rolled at character creation and is the characters dark demise. If he acquires enough fate points then he succumbs to his fate and dies. A player can ask for fate points during the game and these points are used as dice to help him along. A player can get rid of Fate points by completing an <i>ambition</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Ambitions</b><br/>\nEach character starts the game with 3 different ambitions that give them bonus dice to use in the pursuit of the ambition. If for instance their ambition is to <i>find a cure for a plague suffered by the people of planet Delphoi</i>  and the player is acting in that pursuit he gets bonus dice. When a player completes an ambition he gets experience points on the spot, gains glory and writes the completed ambition down ad a Deed that his hero has completed. Also when he completes an ambition he looses a fate point<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Glory</b><br/>\nAll heroes in HELLAS are trying to become immortal by doing great deed in the eyes of other Hellenes and their gods. The more glory you have the more social bonuses you have and the more favor you have with the gods. At certain levels of glory the gods give a hero gifts. The gifts are special abilities only possessed by those favored by the gods. When a hero reaches a certain level of glory they are immortalized in the stars and make a new character.<br/>\nHeroes get glory from a number of things: Fighting naked, doing great deeds, writing poem, defeating ones foes, dying, making love, and having children.<br/>\nGlory is passed on to the new character if the old one dies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>What do heroes do in HELLAS?</i><br/>\nThey are the special heroes who save known space. Their Destinies, Fates, Ambitions and Disadvantages motivate the game and shape the adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a metaplot and game world for the heroes to interact with so there will be a wealth of things for the players to do in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Why should I play this game?</i><br/>\nIts huge and has larger than life characters who are fated to die but live there life knowing this. My friend Lenny suggested that I am the \u201cKing of Old New School\u201d. I attempt to make games with a newness and quality to them from old ideas and play styles I grew up with, combing the two.<br/>\nI hope that this game gives a new flavor to space opera that isn\u2019t Star Trek or Star Wars, or Firefly. My ambition is to put some stank on Sci-Fi that hasn\u2019t been done in a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Games that inspired what I want to do</i><br/>\nThe Shadows of Yesterday<br/>\nSpirit of the Century<br/>\nHercules and Xena<br/>\nPendragon<br/>\nDynasty Warriors<br/>\nFading Suns<br/>\nThe books Dune, Legion of Super Heroes, and the Age of Bronze<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>What I\u2019m looking for in a playtest</i><br/>\nI want to know if the systems for glory, ambition, fate, destiny and disadvantages work in the greater scheme of the game. I know that combat works, and the mechanics work. I want to know if the game as a whole works to achieve a Greek space opera. Does it feel right or does it feel clunky, overly produced and derivative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t want my game to suck and I would like the people here to help me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps. Let me know if you have any more questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124490/#Comment_124490" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T05:50:41+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  5:50AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Jerry.
