There are always 60 of the same cards in a precon deck:  There are always the same 20 cards in any given booster.<br/><br/>Again, Ben, and all Bliss Stage fans, please comment.<br/><br/>So far I'm going to make decks for -<br/><br/>- Final Act, a Victory/Bliss-out deck, which builds up to an assault on the Dark Side Of The Moon for the win.<br/>- <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/curs/wiki.pl?RapidEyeMovement" rel="nofollow">Rapid Eye Movement</a>, a Victory/Humanity deck, which focuses on dealing with Trauma in constructive ways.<br/>- <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/2007/08/29/bliss-stage-saved-through-childbearing/" rel="nofollow">Saved Through Childbearing,</a> an Awareness/Humanity deck, which heals and grows too fast for the aliens to stop: special thanks to Seth-Ben Erza for letting me cardify it.<br/>- <a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/ChildrenOfChildren" rel="nofollow">Children of Children</a>, an Awareness/Victory deck, which pays for many cards representing <a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/ChildrenOfChildren:The_Touched" rel="nofollow">the Touched</a> by gaining Terror instead of Bliss and counting on their ability to shut down Nightmare cards.<br/><br/>So far, I just have the concepts for the REM cards, and two actual preliminary designs - but here they are -<br/><br/>Objectives:<br/><br/>3 x Destroy Alien Drone (Victory.  Zaps for 3 Stress when any Objective is attempted and upon failing an attempt to complete it.)<br/>3 x Secure Medical Supplies (Humanity.  When completed, put 3 tokens on it.  You may remove 2 tokens from it at any time to remove a Trauma from any Character.)<br/>3 x Scavenge Equipment (Humanity.  When completed, put 3 tokens divided any way you wish on any Completed Objectives.)<br/>2 x Destroy Hidden Hive (Victory.  Each time any Objective is attempted, the current Nightmare may search their deck for any Nightmare card, show it to all players, and put it into their hand, then they shuffle their deck.)<br/>2 x Anchor Initiation (Awareness.  To attempt this Objective, an additional Character must act.  When completed, attach to that Character: that Character is now an Anchor in addition to any other subtypes.)<br/>2 x Pilot Training (Victory.  To attempt this Objective, an additional Character must act.  When completed, attach to that Character: that Character is now a Pilot in addition to any other subtypes.)<br/><br/>Characters:<br/>3 x Jessica Simmons, Puppy Eyed (Trust bonuses, Innocent subtype)<br/>3 x Lloyd Frey, Rising Star (Either +3 Int to one rel or +1 / +1 to two, Devoted subtype)<br/>3 x Thomas Adams, Falling Away With You (Inflict 1 Stress on Thomas / Anchored pilot in response to a Nightmare to negate it, Experienced subtype.)<br/>3 x Alice Robinson, Driven By Guilt (Passive +1 Power bonus to her Anchored Pilot: Act to get +4 Power, Driven subtype.)<br/>2 x Amanda Norris, More Than Patient (Ignores the first point of Stress inflicted to any of her Rels (but not directly to her), Devoted Adolescent subtypes.)<br/>2 x Tarragon Farah, Won't Leave You Falling (Redirects Stress inflicted on anyone with a Relationship to him, or to their other rels, to his rel with them, Heroic Adolescent subtype.)<br/>2 x Christopher Reed, Winterborn (Anyone with a Rel to him can act to place a token on a Completed Objective you control. Devoted Adolescent subtype.  Note he does not begin play as a Pilot.)<br/>2 x Tina Benjamin, She'll Hear Me (Begins play with Trauma.  4/4 leftward relationship, 2/2 upward and downward.  )<br/>2 x Jessica Simmons, Murderous Wolf (Can trade Stress for Power on a 1 to 1 basis, Innocent Veteran subtype, Veteran cost 3)<br/>2 x Lloyd Frey, Falling Star (You can pay both parts of his Veteran cost to put a +5 Power token on any Pilot he has a Traumatized Relationship to. Devoted Veteran subtype, Veteran cost 4.)<br/>2 x Rachael Robinson, First Love (In response to a Nightmare played during an attempt she is not participating in, you may inflict a Trauma on any of her outgoing rels to have her join the Attempt.  She must Act and be Anchored as normal.)<br/><br/>Tactics:<br/>3 x Ego Shield (Prevents 4 Stress to a character).<br/>3 x Subconscious Frame (Pick any Attempting pilot.  This Attempt, in order for a Nightmare to Pick that Pilot, they must spend an additional 2 Terror.)<br/>2 x I Can't Go Out Like This (Play this card in response to the Destruction of a Pilot attempting an Objective to retroactively add 15 Power to the attempt.  The Pilot is still Destroyed.)<br/><br/>Nightmares:<br/>3 x Paranoid Fantasies (This turn, reduce one Relationship's Intimacy to its Trust.)<br/>3 x Falling Upwards (This turn, reverse one Relationship's Intimacy and Trust values (5 / 2 becomes 2 / 5).)<br/>3 x Searing Rays (Inflict 3 Stress to any Character.)<br/><br/>Interludes:<br/>3 x Samsarol (Put 3 tokens on this card when it comes into play.  You may remove a token instead of gaining 2 Bliss or any fraction thereof.  You may remove multiple tokens at once.)<br/><br/>60 cards total.<br/><br/>The two cards I've statted properly are a Devoted Lover version and a Seasoned Vet (formerly Devoted) version of Lloyd Frey.  Took down the pictures.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168468/#Comment_168468" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T07:01:40+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  7:01AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a CCG designer, I gotta say this is intriguing as I see the cards.

Children of Children's is a starburst over a heart, circled by a crescent moon: Saved by Childbearing, a stylized man and pregnant woman back to back, holding hands.<br/><br/>The new layout version of Lloyd Frey, Rising Star.  Arguably the main character of REM, he spent the whole of the campaign trying to exorcise the ghost of his lover, the pilot Rachael Robinson, who died saving him from an attack by an alien ace that took the form of Rachael to attack him.  Hence the +3 Int token: the two 1/1's are for his living lovers, Anchor and Rachael's sister Alice, and for cook Amanda.<br/><a href="http://s472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/?action=view&amp;current=FreyRising2.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://i472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/FreyRising2.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>Yukiko Tendoh, my usual interpretation of Keenan's Anchor when I play her / Keenan.  Surname is a psuedonym, of course.  Just meant as a generic Kind anchor.<br/><a href="http://s472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/?action=view&amp;current=Yukie.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://i472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/Yukie.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>Lily Shores (her surname is a pun on how they found her, washed up on shore: she has no true surname), Jon Derek Smith's anchor in Children of Children, my PbP about Sara Smith leading her children, and the children of the other Final Act characters, into battle to finish their parents job.  She is one of the Touched, a race of humans who were exposed to dream-energies in the womb circa 22 years from <b>RIGHT NOW.</b>  As such, her power nets her Terror, rather than Bliss, which is powerful - IF you can survive the pwning by Nightmares that will ensue.  <br/><br/>Her rels are totally borked: she needs at least a 3/3 to the left and a 3/1 upwards, to represent her rel with Jon and to Casey Lin before she died screaming right before the game began (we tend to do that in my games; see Rachael Robinson above).<br/><a href="http://s472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/?action=view&amp;current=Lily.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://i472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/Lily.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>A Tactic (one shot effect card), and a powerful one, is next - I Can't Go Out Like This!, which makes a dying pilot go out in a blaze of Power.  Picture will be of Rachael, fatally wounded, squeezing the life out of her doppelganger.<br/><a href="http://s472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/?action=view&amp;current=ThisSacrifice.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://i472.photobucket.com/albums/rr82/BlissAuthority/ThisSacrifice.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>I was wondering how I could represent sexual relationships between an Authority Figure and another character mechanically: I think that Robbing The Cradle is a good solution.  This is the CoC version, and therefore represents Sara with a 17-year old Seasoned Veteran Archer Lin; there will be one with far more disturbing flavor text in the Final Act set (Anna and Jim - and I only JUST realized how frightening the parallels are).
