In getting back to the normal order of your lives, you inadvertently find yourselves becoming the heroes, though you may never be aware of what you've done. Play your monster as a pawn in the story, using them to achieve the goals that you want, by using them to stomp, steal or investigate the story's obstacles.<br/><br/>The download includes twelve different monster playsheets:<br/><br/><b>The Avian:</b> a giant flying creature.<br/><b>The Bug:</b> a giant insect.<br/><b>The Critter:</b> a giant mammal.<br/><b>The Crustacean:</b> a giant crab or lobster.<br/><b>The Digger:</b> a giant burrower.<br/><b>The Glob:</b> a giant mess.<br/><b>The Lizard:</b> a giant scaly creature.<br/><b>The Mech:</b> a giant robot.<br/><b>The Plant:</b> a giant vegetable.<br/><b>The Simian:</b> a giant ape-like creature.<br/><b>The Swarm:</b> a giant colony life-form.<br/><b>The Unspeakable:</b> a giant horror.<br/><br/>There are also two other files:<br/><br/><b>Monster Force Terra:</b> the core rule booklet, a mere 10 pages long, including tips for the MC on running the game.<br/><b>Reference Sheet:</b> print this on the back of the playsheets.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
