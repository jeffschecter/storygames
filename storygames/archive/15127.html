All they have to do is say what their character does from their character's perspective. If what they describe triggers a Move, then the GM calls for that Move. Otherwise the players don't have to worry about the Move mechanics, just roleplaying.<br/><br/>But here is my experience:<br/><br/>If the list of Moves is in front of a player, they will often look at the list, pick a Move, and then describe actions to try to justify the use of that move. The mechanics lead the fiction, not the fiction leading the mechanics. The fiction becomes secondary and less "what would my character do here" and more "how do I convince the GM to let me roll this Stat instead of that Stat."<br/><br/>So I've run DW where the players don't have the Move sheet in front of them.<br/><br/>And...<br/><br/>...it was awesome! <br/><br/>That 1 change made the game feel a lot richer to all those involved. I'm not saying this will be the case with all players. I know people who would grow uncomfortable not having all the mechanics in front of them. One size doesn't fit all. But so far this has become my preferred way to play. <br/><br/>And what's great about Dungeon World and Apocalypse World, players don't have to spend a lot of time thinking how to avoid specific Moves because of fear of failure (relative to other RPGs). The average roll on 2d6 is a 7 so on average you will succeed. Where in D&amp;D, the difference between a skill I'm good at and I'm not good at can range between +0 and +8 or more. You rarely want to roll skills you are bad at. And there is no reward for doing so. So a lot of people spend a lot of time retrofitting fiction to optimize for success and not simply doing what makes sense for your character. DW/AW's mechanics help alleviate this problem.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343828/#Comment_343828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T08:17:15+00:00" title="September 24, 2011  8:17AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've often thought about doing this, but never tried it.

There is little meta thinking in the game. I can't say I "Hack &amp; Slash" a monster. I don't reference most moves / game mechanics directly. Instead I simply say what my character does in the fiction and the GM evaluates if my roleplaying triggers a game mechanic. This adds to our immersion (which is subjective to us). It helps us feels close to our characters and the fiction.<br/><br/>But trying to figure out ways to use a Stat that someone else highlighted to gain XP so you can level up breaks that mind set for us (which is again subjective and may not be the case for many other people). The players in Dungeon World only have 1 agenda. And this mechanic seems to run counter to that agenda. At least that is how it felt in play for us. <br/><br/>There were also other issues with tying XP to limited stat use. Certain stats may be used more frequently in a given session. If my charisma stat is highlighted, I may spend 10 minutes roleplaying and only roll charisma once. If my strength stat is highlighted, in that same 10 minutes, I may roll strength 3+ times. Combat has hit points which means rolling multiple times to achieve a single goal. There is also the issue that some classes make frequent use of a single stat, so if 1 players has their class stat highlighted and another player doesn't, the difference in XP gained was very apparent to us. Which meant the player not gaining XP started thinking of ways to get more XP. Which often meant not playing their character as if they were a real person, but more as a puppet or avatar. <br/><br/>That all said, I don't want to make this sound like a bigger deal than it is. I really enjoy playing Dungeon World!</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343838/#Comment_343838" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T10:18:03+00:00" title="September 24, 2011 10:18AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Felan</cite>After my first experience running DW last weekend, I felt exactly the same way.

I have to admit I've never played Dungeon World, but I have played a lot of Apocalypse World, and in my experience having the moves sheet to show you some examples of things you can do in the situation you're in really helps the game. I probably just want different things from the game than you guys, but it seems to me that playing towards a move is a big part of the design, a big part of what keeps the game in-genre. I've only once had a bad experience with highlighted stats, and that was when one pc read a sitch for a psychic fight between a brainer and a hoarder, that he wasn't involved in, and the MC had to stop and answer his questions. It was a problem of pacing, not immersion.

The rules define only a small part of it. In Dungeon World, you can <i>and should</i> have a conversation between characters, wander from room to room, decide to avenge your brother's death, make your rogue do a little jig after a successful kill, or have your paladin heartily clap his fellow party-members on the back.<br/><br/>These non-move actions are a key part of the universe of possiblity in DW, but the moves list can unintentionally make them secondary. I don't think playing without a moves list is sustainable across a whole campaign, but I do think it's an interesting and potentially very effective way of getting players into the spirit of the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343860/#Comment_343860" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T12:47:44+00:00" title="September 24, 2011 12:47PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2011 1:07PM by johnzo.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>2.

Yet we had plenty of players say, "I Backstab them", even in situations where the enemy wasn't surprised or defenseless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344125/#Comment_344125" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T12:06:21+00:00" title="September 27, 2011 12:06PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2011 12:08PM by Cneph.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I put together a move sheet starting with John's list and no moves names for the game last night.

Using the fictional requirement list minus the Move names mostly worked when I played with people who had experience with DW before. But with new players, since the character sheets reference the Move names, it caused confusion. To make it work well, I would need to rewrite the character sheets which is more work than I'm able to do at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344182/#Comment_344182" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T20:50:23+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  8:50PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great discussion. I like the idea of replacing the moves list with fiction prompts. I've found the game runs great until player's learn the rules, things really seem to derail when players start reading the moves like a menu of options. I'd much rather have the players running around doing whatever they want, and just using the moves list as a set of guidelines for creating custom moves for each situation. Next time I run I might replace move selection with stakes negotiation. So, before the roll we always establish what 10+ is, and 7-9. I'll use the moves as recommendations based on the situation, but not tell the player "that sounds like hack and slash."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344256/#Comment_344256" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T12:33:50+00:00" title="September 28, 2011 12:33PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.<br/><br/>In that case you could have the text blocks that include the various choices for the player ("when you roll 10+, choose 2:") in context:\n<blockquote><br/>When you're engaged in combat with an armed foe...<br/><br/>10+: choose 2<br/>7-9: choose 1<br/>* Suffer little harm...<br/>etc.<br/></blockquote>\nSo at the table, the player says, "I want to do X."

I don't care if he gets a piece of me at this point. I'm going all out, I'm just going to rush in there jump up and thrust my sword down into his chest."<br/><br/>GM: "Cool. So, on 10+ you'll take his attack, but you'll deal your damage + 1d6. 7-9 his attack will knock you off balance so you can't get the extra force behind the blow so you'll only deal your normal damage."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344523/#Comment_344523" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T11:45:30+00:00" title="September 30, 2011 11:45AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeffrey,<br/><br/>Yep!
