His presentation of this idea clicked with me, especially when combined with REIGN. But that is not the matter here.<br/><br/>My question: How do you get from historical fact to game content that is usable, concise and evocative? Are there god ways? Pit falls? Whatever?<br/><br/>Finally, although I address Jason directly (because of his being on record for incorporating and building on historical backgrounds for his games), I am happy to get input from all the other good souls, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138362/#Comment_138362" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T17:25:43+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  5:25PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a lot of success with just reading everything I can find about the period in question and taking note of everything that makes me think it would be cool in a game.

Everyone worries about language, details of daily life as well as big events. THE FUN: Out-of-game research, bringing some new detail to the table, learning something.<br/><br/>2 - Modest accuracy.  Emphasize several solid historical points, details of daily life are now glossed, but big events stay big and accurate.  THE FUN: Hey, here we are at these big events with a feeling that history is going on around us without having to learn too much!<br/><br/>3 - TV accuracy.  Reduce historical details to a one-page precis of things important to the events of the game.  Beyond that, extrapolate, make things up, or make historical accuracy the sole provence of one player, to whom everyone else owes props but not learning. THE FUN: Nifty color without much ivnestment in learning what 'really happened.'<br/><br/>4 - Blatant inaccuracy.  Say up front that you're just making shit up that sounds cool, a la Xena or Jack of All Trades.  THE FUN: Hey, look at that historical figure doing goofy things with us! ACES!<br/><br/>More soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138376/#Comment_138376" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T22:29:12+00:00" title="April  5, 2008 10:29PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can't be one hundred percent correct, but you can pick out some very key differences and make them really stand out. It enhances the idea or the dream of the time.<br/><br/>Example: 1860's New York city. Full of horses, so it smells of horseshit, has stables at the rate that the modern city has cornershops, and blacksmiths and farriers abound. Keep going. About one out of every hundred people you knew would be involved with working with horses directly, buying, selling, keeping them healthy, putting shoes on them, and housing them, one in twenty people would work with horses secondarily, drovers, teamsters, carriagemen, etc. This is a huge difference and means a lot if it's brought to the fore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Players must be convinced after reading the game that they can get a fun play experience out of it even if they don't have a ph.d. degree in history within the field.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you must be sure that there is room for the players to fill and that they have meaningful choices to make. You don't want your game to re-tell history, but to open a room for players to explore fiction inspired by historical facts. What kind of dilemmas did people face in that period? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are not familiar with Ars Magica, then take a look at how they approach this dilemma of historical fact &amp; player imagination &amp; freedom of choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138392/#Comment_138392" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T08:24:18+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  8:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good advice so far!  Here's the thing, Harald - some of the decisions you make will depend on your goals, obviously.  <br/><br/>How important is it that you "honor ground truth"?  Are you, in fact, retelling a broad historical event that is largely outside the influence of the players?  Or are you presenting a setting and saying "here's a playground, go crazy"?  I can't offer much advice about the latter.  <br/><br/>I'm much more interested in the former, and I feel some obligation to do no violence to reality, to the extent that is practical.  With <i>Grey Ranks</i> it was like "damn, this is a real thing that happened to real people, some of whom might read this game."  It was something I was constantly aware of.<br/><br/>For me, that meant really absorbing as much information from as many sources as possible - I approached it like research and, although primary sources were largely unavailable to me, I took advantage of a major research library to the fullest.  Once I had a real appreciation and (as much as is ever possible) understanding of the events I was going to write about, I thought about exactly what you are asking, Harald.  What are the channels for providing information to the players?  What is essential and what is simply enrichment?  How can I deliver the essential <i>during play</i>, and how can I package the rest to be accessible and compelling?  <br/><br/>I think the key is to structure your game to provide all the information necessary to appreciate and utilize the setting during play.  If you have to read twenty pages of text to understand and enjoy it, you've failed.  Definitely <i>have </i>those twenty pages, and make sure that reading them increases the quality of the experience, but don't require it.  So my answers for <i>Grey Ranks:</i><br/><br/>1.  The obligatory twenty pages of background, supplemented by sidebars that point out game-worthy bits of history relevant to the rules text they accompany<br/>2.  Radio Lightning transcripts, which are read before each of ten chapters, and give everybody a feel for what's going on while injecting some salient information.<br/>3.  Situation elements, shameless cadged and re-purposed from In A Wicked Age, which give players choices about what pieces of the historical narrative they want to explore, if any.  <br/><br/>I've found that even with this careful set-up, you still need about five minutes of "What was the Warsaw Uprising?" (at least with Americans; Europeans tend to have learned about it in school).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138587/#Comment_138587" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T14:22:47+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  2:22PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: oliof</cite>Hi Jason,<br/>a friend of mine just proposed a cool idea for a roleplaying background, set in the mid thirteenth century, in the kiev rus</blockquote>\nIf you're interested in medieval Rus', you could do a lot worse than to look at <i><a href="http://galeotti.co.uk/mythicrussia.aspx" rel="nofollow">Mythic Russia</a></i>, which is all about mid-14th century Rus'.  It's an excellent book, with tons of background, and I heartily recommend it.  <br/><br/>I think it's also a good example of how to make a historical setting gameable.  Mark Galeotti, the game's author, is a professional Russian historian, but he has a good eye for how to make the historical detail relevant to a gamer's needs.  Most of the background is written so as to make it easy to introduce into a game.  <br/><br/>Neil.<br/><br/>(Disclaimer: I wrote the scenario in the back of the book.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151161/#Comment_151161" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T06:52:32+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  6:52AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pulling some thread necormancy:<br/><br/>Read for the coolness in historical non-fiction.  It is full of bizarre but cool.  <br/><br/>Start with the unique material culture of the area you are interested in, find the myth, and then force a gaming twist.<br/><br/>Let me give you an example of three from some Ars Magica work I did.<br/><br/>Myth: Amber is believed, in many areas around the Baltic Sea, to be made from the roof of the palace of an underwater faerie princess.<br/><br/>Twist: This technically means that if you look at how much amber washes up in different places and when, and you get a guy who is Charlie Epps for the C13th, you can work a) she must be a sea giant princess to have a roo f that big and b) exactly where the source of all this material is.<br/><br/>Myth (well, fact):<br/>I read somewhere that there were no emerald mines in Europe: all of the emeralds come from Egypt.  There used to be an emerald mine in Europe during Roman times but in the Middle Ages they lost track of it.  It's open again in the modern day.<br/><br/>Twist: Now, how do you -lose- the only emerald mine in a continent?  There's some sort of story there.<br/><br/>Fact:<br/>People in the ancient salt mines of part of the Alps used to mine the salt in heart shaped blocks.  No-one knows why.  They have since, in other places, made great cathedrals where everything is carved from salt.<br/><br/>Twist: They had a godess who needed to have new hearts carved for her out of salt.  Why?  Given that they gave that up when the Christians came, what's she doing for salt now?  <br/><br/>Find an odd fact.  Ask "Why?"
