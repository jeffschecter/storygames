In other words, I have NPCs choose to be controlled rather than killed, and marvel openly at the stupidity (or passion?) of those that would go the other route.<br/><br/>It's really gone a long way towards helping players not dig in their characters' heels. "A1 steak sauce instead of Heinz?! NEVER! I'LL DIE FIRST!!!"

"Surrender or die" (how I read your NPC example) isn't mind control: the player still has agency. "[hidden die roll] OK, you're mind controlled; you surrender and fall in love with the mind flayer" fucks with people.<br/><br/>I don't see the former (compulsion) as much of a problem... in the context of games which have the characteristics spelled out in that other thread (character embodies player's ethos and ideals; major investment to even begin play or due to continuing long-term play; being frozen out of play for inordinate periods of time; etc).<br/><br/>I'll add another wiggle, from my own LARP rules design: not every player is wise or kind. Shit like seduction and mind control can make folks quit a LARP, if it is even slightly abused; and losing folks = not affording play space (even if the abuser is punished, the trust is gone).<br/><br/>And ANOTHER wiggle, from LARP experiences in general: I am a "DO" LARPer, not a "STAT" LARPer. That's why I play boffer not MET or Cthulhu Live (though I dig the latter, for con games or other places where a contact LARP is impractical or dangerous). As  DO LARPer, I think winning friends and influencing people is a real world skill which can and should be exercised, in play. JUST like firing an Airsoft or swinging a boffer (the former can make one a VERY good .22 marksman, and the latter is basically escrima). And, in my own system's design, if it can be done safely, affordably, and without inordinate ridiculousness... you DO it, dammit. So making a "mind control" ability is just... lame. (Note, I've always had a "fear"-like ability that can only make someone leave your presence, if you use it A LOT on them--more a monster ability than a viable character ability: you'll get wacked once it wears off, because folks don't dig being told to leave a cool scene.)<br/><br/>That said... I succumbed to the lameness, during the last design discussion. I now have "Compel" and "Forget" Abilities which are VERY expensive, have the Bomb Icon (which means "GMs WATCH OUT!"), and is basically REALLY weak--last minutes, at best; and if "low powered" probably won't work at all. hey, what can I say? Fucking peer pressure.... (Though I'm not out of Gold Candidate Testing, yet; and if I see *one* abusive or uber use of them, they're GONE!)<br/><br/>Sorry for the Friday afternoon ramble...

Violates the Czege Principal too.<br/><br/>Sooo... what to do? Well in Mutants and Masterminds games, if someone like Poison Ivy mind controls a PC, then I give the player a hero point for the complication, and I make sure that the player gets fun by continuing to run the mind-controlled character against his former team mates or mess up his dependent NPC, until the control wears off. I also spice things up with the Poison Ivy character using confuse or some other effects, and not just mind control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206394/#Comment_206394" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T15:46:18+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  3:46PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's because in combat you always have the choice to do something about the situation till you're dead. You could have the same for things like seduction and manipulation if there was some kind of cost associated with trying to break free. In Marshall Burns' game The Rustbelt this works very well since players can succeed at anything if they just pour in enough resources, you can always break out of the seduction but if it's difficulty rating is high and your willpower stats are low you might want to wait till you are in a situation you can deal with getting your emotional pool Tears filled to the brim since if it goes over 20 you'll be incapacitated. Basically, the player doesn't lose control he just gets a condition: fight or you'll be in love just as being attacked is a condition fight or die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206457/#Comment_206457" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T07:06:53+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  7:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also true that for a lot of players RP is very much about empowerment fantasy and the fantasy of agency.

We roll dice and compare. Whoever is lowest has the choice to Give or to Push. Giving means taking your failure and liking it. Pushing means losing some resources, but winning anyway. Of course, since Influence is a diametric thing (only one person can win), the other guy can Push Back and create a Deadlock, in which we can go back and forth for several rounds, shedding resources as we go, until one of us Gives.<br/><br/>In other words, it's all about resolve.

In combat, you're inherently in a contested situation.  If you're beaten, there's a consequence, but it doesn't seem as disempowering as losing agency--even if you're killed (paradoxically).<br/><br/>Put another way, taking away or reducing a character's capabability to affect the fictional world seems to differ from taking away the character's decision-making capacity.  I've had players with mind-controlled characters react <i>very</i> strongly, almost violently, against being controlled, to the point where the only way I would ever contemplate it in a game would be (a) the doppelganger gambit, with the "real" character spirited elsewhere, or (b) the bennie/reward approach for roleplaying the control.<br/><br/>I'm talking about outright control of the Charm Person sort, mind you.  I haven't had the same problems with social influence or (non-supernatural) seduction.

To accommodate player initiatives is good.</b><br/><br/>The player may take all kinds of initiatives in a role-playing game (not all games allows for all initiatives, but still). How the game supports any given initiative varies, of course, but the general rule is that any initiative may create a situation, which in turn may lead to a consequence (change something; a relation, a course of action, the atmosphere, a material object).<br/><br/>If there is conflict in the situation, the consequence may be something the character don't enjoy. This is mostly ok. There is nothing principally wrong with the character being challenged.<br/><br/>A consequence may be something the character enjoy, which at the same time makes the player squirm. This may, or may not, be ok. There is nothing wrong with the player being challenged through his character (walk in strange shoes, etc.), but most players will be put off with an overload of squirm.<br/>---&gt; <b>A little squirm</b> will make the player feel challenged; he will face his own shortcomings/neuroses/feelings/preconceptions through the condition of the character, or he will feel his character being threatened, but will be able to play on and explore the condition, being loyal to the demands of the interaction and/or fiction. This is an interesting position to be in, as a player, and may open up for exploration with mind-changing qualities.<br/>---&gt; <b>An overload of squirm</b> will make the player feel bad, and detract from his game-joy. What makes an "overload" varies. How the game-motor supports the players in various situations, have a lot to say in this. Lack of support often leaves the players with little or no options for initiatives, and that puts the game in danger of "squirm-overload". So a broad-themed game need to have general ways of dealing with situations that may leave the players with their characters in unwanted conditions, to help them see acceptable venues of interplay.<br/><br/>"Interplay" may be any of these three;<br/>- playing with his own character-concept<br/>- playing with the situation<br/>- playing with relations to other characters<br/><br/>This leads me to a rephrasing of the first paragraph in my post: <b> Player interplay are the foundation of role-playing games. A game needs to create venues of interplay for the players at all times.</b><br/><br/>I hope this has spurred some thoughts in you.

If the GM can persuade the player to embrace the agenda of the controlling force or individual and run with it, as opposed to sitting around watching their character move like at automaton, it's not so bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207360/#Comment_207360" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T12:20:11+00:00" title="May 14, 2009 12:20PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, getting back to my OP, here's an actual play example of what I've done.<br/><br/>The game is nWoD, the players are part of a Southern Arizona/Northern Mexico crime family of immigrant smugglers.<br/><br/>A branch of the family wants to get back into dealing and transporting drugs. The PCs, for various reasons, oppose this. They fear a bloody civil war that the pro-drugs side of the family is likely to win because they have access to a LOT more money.  So they are going around trying to cut off support for that side of the family, open up new "business opportunities", some legit, some shady to keep everyone busy, and isolate the leader of that branch of the family so that if a war happens it will be a one-bullet war.<br/><br/>The other branch of the family is doing the same.<br/><br/>They are trying to subvert a shady owner of several crappy motels, since he can provide work for immigrants as well as help with temporary safe houses.  A rival syndicate threatened him, extorted him and he backed down.  I then depicted him as being happier and more relaxed.  He doesn't have to fight. He isn't happy about paying the money but it beats fighting all the time and constantly worrying.  (The PCs stepped in and did the fighting for him without him asking, which he was not super-happy about but which he also accepted.) <br/><br/>The lesson here is that in the world I've established, threats work, and they stick.  The guy wasn't plotting against the people that controlled him, he was cool with it.<br/><br/>That gives the PCs this strategy to use on others in the game world and gives them a strong demonstration of it.<br/><br/>I've done the same with bribery and blackmail, too.  People stay intimidated or bought.  People who resist to the point of being put in danger of their lives are mocked and reviled (sometimes posthumously). "What a fucking idiot, they COULD have just given in and made a pile of money."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207373/#Comment_207373" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T12:51:10+00:00" title="May 14, 2009 12:51PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>It's also true that for a lot of players RP is very much about empowerment fantasy and the fantasy of agency.

Thing is, that's the players doing "mind control" on an NPC, then coming up with a totally acceptable background reason why the NPC would be happy with such a thing (which I dig: Make your skill check, then success or failure being sure, a little dependent of the actual skill of the player, but play up the background that influenced success or failure as well). <br/><br/>The bit you quoted in your OP, and which David talked about a little, was directed towards PCs though. Like, what happens when the PCs influence/'mind control' (Social, Manipulation, etc roll) an NPC? Everyone's cool with it. But when the GM turns around and does the same to a PC and succeeds, then there could be a freakout:<br/><br/>The scene: Your situation above. For some reason or another, one of the PCs is at a club, runs into the lieutenant of the other crime family. They talk in a kind of "Deneiro and Pacino in HEAT" way.<br/>The player makes a roll of some kind to get the lieutenant to accidentally spill a secret about their operation, family, etc. Success. Secret spilled.<br/>The GM then rolls the Lieutenant's Manipulation against the PC in order to have the PC give up a secret about their family or the other PCs, and even give up 1-2 secrets (or perform 1-2 small tasks) as a mole.<br/>GM: Success! Wow, I beat you by like 5 successes. So you're <i>totally</i> this dude's mole. I mean, he's not going to order you to do something stupid or crazy, but from time to time he compels you to do something for him for the sake of his family.<br/><br/>So, a lot of folks would have a problem with that. Personally, if I got involved in that roll and knew what was on the table, I'd concede and try to come up with a cool background story for why it works for me: <br/>*My character is jealous of another person in the family (until one second ago? This was not the case. But as a player I grasped at straws, and came up with this rationalization that works for me), so I'll do things against the family but focused on taking out that one character, but yeah overall damaging to the family. Works for me."<br/><br/>Maybe it's all in the handwavey way we describe the results of those rolls, or letting creative players come up with the explanation for their failure? Because I've seen games play out like the above roll, but where the GM narrates, and the GM basically has the PC give up secrets like they were under truth serum or act against the house like a mind-controlled zombie, solely because of "the skill" of the opponent (that is, not inventing background reasons why it might make sense). To which players tend to get pissed.<br/><br/>Another situation (the above I made up, but for this one I was a player under another GM): Star Wars. You have a Centennial Sparrow, you and the other PCs are flying around, smuggling stuff. A star destroyer intercepts you, locks on to your ship and pulls you on board. This is happening because, well, the GM's adventure is set on the inside of the star destroyer, where he plans on having - eventually - the PCs blow shit up and escape, with even more cargo.<br/><br/>The problem is in the execution. <br/>GM: "They lock on their tracking beam"<br/>Player: "What? Can't I escape?"<br/>GM: "Nope. They're pulling you in."<br/>Player: "I fire all our lasers and try to destroy their tractor beam."<br/>GM: "It's not going to work. You're going to have to surrender."<br/>Player: "Fuck that, I'd never surrender."<br/>and so on. Now, there's a million pieces in play in this scenario, a thousand things that could have been done to mitigate the situation, but at the end of the day it boils down to a "Your character must do this...", "Your character thinks this...", "Your character feels this about that person..." etc.<br/><br/>Just curious if you had any examples of that sort of thing: NPCs (through you) "winning" a social/mentail dominance-style struggle against a player, where the underlying stakes (spoken or unspoken) were that they do something that the player might not imagine their character doing normally.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207422/#Comment_207422" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T15:22:59+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  3:22PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2009 3:38PM by John_Powell.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>GM: "It's not going to work.
