                    I will admit to underhanded promotional desires with this post.  I will admit that I'm hoping to attract some business from my fellow denizens of Story Games.  But, besides that, I just wanted to tapdance happily and note that, after eight years, there's finally a print version of <i>Legends of Alyria</i> available to the world.  You can get it from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lulu.com/darkomengames" rel="nofollow">Lulu</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Who might be interested in this game?  Folks who are into slightly strange fantasy settings.  If you liked The Shadow of Yesterday or Hero Wars, you might be interested in Legends of Alyria.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Legends of Alyria was an inspiration for both Universalis and Polaris.  This is a weird fact, but it is true.<br/>
<br/>
But, even if you aren't in the market for another game, I just wanted to share the joy.  After such a long time, I'm finally finished.<br/>

Fantastic to hear and see, man.  I've been eagerly anticipating the release of this game for a long time now and will happily send you my money.  Hope you don't mind if I wait until after christmas when I'm done buying things for people that I feel obligated to.  <br/>

Once again man, congratulations on getting this game out there.  <br/>

It is!  It really is.

Hmm, let's see.  If I'm remembering correctly, I remember beginning to do work on the game sometime in fall 1998.  So, just counting time elapsed, that's eight years.<br/><br/>Reality is that development was fitful.  The basic rules set was locked down by 2001-2002. and the current rules simply formalize stuff that I was already doing informally.  The biggest change was the "tension level", which sets the number of "successes" that you need to win a conflict.  I was doing this sort of thing informally during development, but it's better to have it formally established.<br/><br/>Most of the delay was in writing the manuscript.  This is mostly the result of Real Life interfering, but also I was trying to figure out how to explain Narrativism without talking about Narrativism.  How do you teach the creation of a storymap without actually being there?  Hopefully I succeeded.<br/><br/>Seth                        </div>

If only I'd had this endorsement sooner!  ;-)<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm glad that you like it.

The Vault?  Do you mean the Ark?  If so, then yeah, I like them too.  One of my personal mental images from Alyria in a marching army of Arkites.  They each have these funky naginata-style weapons, except the blades are on fire, and they each wear these black robes.  And, of course, they each are wearing masks BUT THEY'RE THE SAME MASKS.  There's something horrifying in that sameness.<br/><br/>As an aside, does your copy of the book have the landscape cover, or the Devil's Hour glyph?  The original layout was ungood, and Crystal redid it.  Unfortunately, we didn't take down the old version while the new one was in progress.  So, if your cover has the landscape, you have the old one.  Now, if you're happy with it, that's cool.  Just think of it as being an ultra-rare limited edition.  But, if you'd rather have the prettier one, Whisper me (or something) and we can work that out somehow.

You could convert the game to standard numbers very easily.  A roll of 1 is Devil's Hour and a roll of 10 is Sext.  Then just write the target numbers on the character sheet, instead of the clock face.  So, for example, for Matins, write 9+, for Lauds 7+, and so on.<br/><br/>I wasn't just being an artsy flake with the use of symbols, though.  Removing the numbers from the game actually has helped people who don't like math to enjoy the game.  I know that this sounds silly, but one of my sisters really grooved on the use of symbols for just that reason.  You can easily grok "more" or "less" by comparing the symbols without ever thinking about numbers.  In addition, this method allowed for a bell curve distribution for dice rolling while still using one die.<br/><br/>There is also the artsy flake reasons for it.  To this day, when I go outside at night and look up at the moon, I think of Alyria.<br/><br/>And that's why, when I play the game, I'll still be using the original moon phases.  I was true to my word and didn't publish with moon phases, but my personal games will still use them.
<blockquote><br/>Good luck with pimping it, you had a buyer in me!  I'll post an Actual Play when it happens.<br/></blockquote>
Actual Play would be a good thing.  I'll be looking forward to it.<br/><br/>And, actually, I should do the same.  I've been so burned out on Alyria that I haven't played it in a long time.  But now, as I'm staring at the book, I'm realizing that I rather enjoyed playing the game.  I have some friends who are wanting to learn a storygame of some kind.  I've been toying with different options, but why not use my own game?  Seems like a good idea to me....<br/><br/>Seth                        </div>

Yeah, the Ark (sorry, I was thinking Vault ala Wasteland) was a time-release superbunker that was supposed to shut for a few weeks while the threat of plague outside passed.  Unfortunately, the computer had a mind of its own (or malfunctioned) and the doors didn't open again for like a <b>THOUSAND YEARS</b>. With limited resources (everyone thought that they'd be in the bunker for MAYBE a few weeks), the people in the bunker turned into this supercommunist no-self hivemind where everyone has roles defined by the masks they wear, and no names and the like.<br/><br/>Talk about culture clash.  But I know that my first campaign is totally going to focus on these guys somehow.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Bite your tongue!  Your honor, I demand that Mr. Ben-Ezra's remark be stricken from the record!  The graphic symbolism is one of the things that make the game!  Everyone should make some dice to use when they play this game.<br/><br/>P.S.  Just to correct the record, the Vaults were from Fallout (and sequels) not Wasteland.                        </div>

Ha!  A "Sell me" request!  Can't pass that up.<br/><br/><i>Legends of Alyria</i> is a post-apocalyptic science fantasy game.  One of the major influences is Gene Wolfe's <i>Book of the New Sun</i>, if you're familiar with that, crossed with <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>.  Honest.<br/><br/>So, first, a thumbnail sketch of the setting.  Alyria is a gas giant that was colonized a thousand years ago by refugees from Earth, now known as the Progenitors, who were fleeing an alien menace known as the Outsiders.  They built great cities, roads, and other such things, including terraforming machines to create the breathable atmosphere.  But the Progenitor society was overthrown.  The dragons that live deep in the atmosphere of the planet discovered the Progenitors and appeared to some of them, offering power in exchange for sacrifice.  Then, when the moment was right, the dragons and their cultists struck.  Along the way, they released a biological weapon known as the ripper plague, which was a powerful mutagen.  The overthrow of this primal society is now known as the Rape.  This cataclysm shaped the current face of Alyria.<br/><br/>So now Alyria looks quite different.  On the political front, there are two "superpowers" of sorts.  The first is the Citadel, which is the archtypical dystopian city, made from iron, and ruled by the five High Lords.  The second is the Ark, which Andy already mentioned.  On the religious front, there are the Keepers, who worship the god Pheric, who is really the computer that controls the terraforming machines.  There are also the dragon cultists, who still worship the dark powers.  Also there are the Chosen, who work with the Unicorns to oppose the dragons and their slaves.  The ripper plague produced various mutations.  Most of them are lumped under the category of Misbegotten.  Some have developed raw psionic powers called the Blessing, which enable them to wield tremendous power which also destroys their bodies.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and recently, the Weeping Moon rose over the horizon.  This red moon is the harbinger of doom, for the Outsiders have finally found Alyria.<br/><br/>There's a lot more going on in the setting.  For example, I haven't even touched on the Web (my personal favorite), but it should be enough for you to get a feel for what is going on.<br/><br/>System-wise, the game is pretty straightforward.  Each character has three Attributes (Force, Insight, and Determination) that set his basic abilities.  However, during conflict, these can be overridden by a Trait, which are various moral characteristics of the character.  These Traits can be used both for and against the character.  So, for example, a character with the "Honest" trait might be able to use it in his favor when trying to earn someone's trust, but he might have it turned against him when another character is trying to lie to him.  As a result of their choices, particularly in conflicts, characters earn points in Inspiration and Corruption, which are used to buy and modify Traits, attempt "auto-win" in conflicts, and the like.<br/><br/>Thus, the focus of the game is on the moral choices that the characters must make..<br/><br/>To play the game, you first have a brainstorming session, similar to the pitch session for PTA.  During this session, you construct a storymap, which is a relationship map variation, showing the various characters in the story and defining their connections to each other.  This is done <i>before</i> characters are assigned to players.  So everyone gets into the act, doing the "prepwork" that a GM normally does.  Once this is done, characters are handed out and play begins.  To be clear, <i>all</i> the major characters are played by players.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways, many of the techniques in Legends of Alyria have already entered the world in other forms.  I mentioned the pitch session from PTA as being one.  The general idea that PvP gaming can actually produce good stories is an idea that has earned a lot of traction in the last several years.  The storymap concept is present in the Polaris cosmos (in part).  Now, I'm not claiming that anyone stole anything from me.  Rather, I'm saying that, when I was doing most of my design work, these ideas were fairly new and radical, even though they may seem fairly normal now.<br/><br/>I actually do have the <a href="http://alyria.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">text of Alyria</a> online, although I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do with it, now that I have a print version available.  So, if you're wanting to do more investigation, you can have a peek over there.  And, of course, I'd be more than happy to answer further questions from folks, either here or in my forum on the Forge.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the interest!<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>You could convert the game to standard numbers very easily.  A roll of 1 is Devil's Hour and a roll of 10 is Sext.  Then just write the target numbers on the character sheet, instead of the clock face.  So, for example, for Matins, write 9+, for Lauds 7+, and so on.</blockquote>
Bite your tongue!  Your honor, I demand that Mr. Ben-Ezra's remark be stricken from the record!  The graphic symbolism is one of the things that make the game!  Everyone should make some dice to use when they play this game.<br/><br/>P.S.  Just to correct the record, the Vaults were from Fallout (and sequels) not Wasteland.<br/><br/>Hey, I'm with you!

                            Everyone who got involved with the Forge prior to, oh, 2003 or so would recognize Alyria as a major influence on the development of theory and game design. It is kinda ironic that when the game is finally released those techniques are considered "old hat".                        </div>

                            To put some perspective on things, Ralph and I were interested in Alyria, and actually got to play in one of the early playtests at Origins along with Jason Blair (in which I laughed so hard at one point I fell off my chair). We were writing that one of the innovative things about the game was how it had no map.<br/>
<br/>
Still no map, right Seth? Like Tim says, today that seems like "So what?" At the time the idea of a setting like this having no map was revolutionary.<br/>
<br/>
So Ralph and I were thinking together, "what if we made a game in which the idea was that the players created the entire map by making skill rolls based on the characters abilities?" That was the birth of what would eventually become Universalis.<br/>
<br/>
And that's how influential Alyria has been, and how revolutionary it was at the time. No map. Can you imagine that? :-)<br/>

                            Seth, <br/><br/>See this is why I can't wait to get Alyria: because it's been in work while all that other stuff was going on. It seems to me that its a game that has a real chance of having mass craft and serious maturity rather than just being another new game. <br/><br/>No shit story: last night Mo says to me, "So Seth's game is on sale" and I say, "Yea, whatever. I've got too many games right now, I'm not interested in more at the moment. At least not until after I've played Reign." <br/><br/>She responds, "But I thought you wanted Legends of Alyria?" and I say, "SHIT! Alyria is out? Fuck, where is the thread?" <br/><br/>Because, you know, Alyria is just that.                        </div>

That story is hilarious!<br/><br/>Funnily enough, when I started reading hardboiled detective novels like this, I didn't notice the clichÃ©, just the awesome. Maybe the difference is that I was self-directed to them, not reading them on someone else's recommendation.                        </div>

                            Seth,<br/><br/>You utter bastard.  I was just last night, not more than 14 hours ago explaining to my girlfriend that while a lot of packages have been arriving at our flat, stuffed to the brim with gaming goodness, I was completely done with buying new games for the foreseeable.  Because, y'know, I have a pile of books to read and there's nothing due out any time soon that can't wait until I've finished that lot.  Except maybe BattleLore.<br/><br/>And then you go and publish Legends Of Alyria!  I mean, I've desperately wanted to own a hardcopy of this game since you emailed me the text, what, three years ago?  It has to be, bar none, the most interesting book I read that year.  The only thing was, there was no way I could run the damn thing at the time.  So here we are, years later and you've made me lie to my girlfriend!<br/><br/><i>On a more serious note, I really mean it when I say that the setting for Alyria simply blew me away when I read it.  It was so evocative and atmospheric, the writing so eloquent and clear that it was impossible not to fall in love with the setting straight away.  Just after I read it I changed jobs, split up with my (now ex) girlfriend and had to move house, so I never got around to telling you exactly what I thought of the book.  Which I regret deeply, now that I am reminded of the game's existence.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for writing this game and for finishing it.<br/><br/>To anyone who hasn't read this I say this: GO BUY THE BOOK.  NOW!</i> </div>
