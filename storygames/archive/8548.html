What struck me was how poor a match the style of Wikipedia is to the style of Achewood. Wikipedia attempts to be encyclopedic and "factual" in tone; Achewood <i>just isn't like that</i>. "Continuity" in something like Achewood consists of reintroducing things that happened previously, not because they form some kind of canon that restricts but because they enrich what is currently being done, by reference. Or something. That probably makes no sense.<br/><br/>Different example. The Simpsons. Again, Wikipedia attempts to do the encyclopedic thing, but The Simpsons just <i>doesn't have a set canon</i> beyond the basics of the characters and situation. Any show in which a high mountain can show up just outside the town, clearly visible from downtown, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderhorn" rel="nofollow">one episode only</a> - and in that episode it's always been there, but it's never been mentioned before or since - has, at best, a very loose canon. (And then there are the deliberately-out-of-continuity Halloween shows.)<br/><br/>Actually, all creative properties of any length are like this, because even if you don't have multiple authors over multiple decades (as the Marvel and DC comics characters have), a single author will forget what he or she has written previously and say something contradictory, or simply won't see a contradiction. It's a favourite game for Sherlock Holmes fans to figure out "logically" things like how many wives Watson had, or how Holmes could use a martial art at the Reichenbach Falls that wouldn't be invented for another decade, but the reality is that Conan Doyle just put things in that he needed for the story he was writing at the time. Achewood and the Simpsons just do it more self-consciously.<br/><br/>Another webcomics example - <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp/d/20080910.html" rel="nofollow">El Goonish Shive</a> in the "newspaper" format comics specifically notes, several times, on panel, that they occur "outside continuity" - that is, they don't affect the main story. They're like fanfic, but written by the original author, a way for him to play with the characters that doesn't have to be reincorporated back into his main, linear narrative.<br/><br/>So, to bring this to a point: Are there games (or, what games might we design) that deliberately do this "loose canon"/"out of continuity" thing? I know that Super Action Now does it (anything can happen at any time without any explanation), but on the spectrum between SAN and complete sanity, are there, or do we want there to be, other games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189406/#Comment_189406" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T12:45:38+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 12:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in Universalis a thing is only a Fact if you spend a Coin on it, so if you say something but don't back it up, it can be contradicted easily later.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you do spend a Coin on it to make it Fact, someone else can still contradict it later, being Fact just makes it easier to Challenge the contradiction.

The next Yarn can take place chronologically before, after, or simultaneous with the last one you played; it can have recurring characters and/or places, or not.  And it can very well contradict previously told Yarns.<br><br>Like, sometimes somebody who died in one Yarn shows up in another Yarn that takes place later in the chronology.  But this is never addressed, see, because <i>in this Yarn</i> he's alive; it doesn't matter what he was in the others.<br/><br/>Because they're <i>Yarns</i>, see?  They're the sorts of stories that people tell each other in bars over a few rounds of beers, or they're tall-tales, or they're old stories that have been passed through generations or from person to person to person.<br/><br/>I talked about this in more detail and made more sense on the Forge or something.  Lemme see if I can find the thread.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>Here's the thread: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27066.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27066.0</a><br/><br/>and here's a copy and paste of some stuff I said:\n<blockquote>My game The Rustbelt is intended specifically for long-term episodic campaigns.  It's based around what I term an "Interwoven Yarn" structure.  That's when you take several short, independent stories (or Yarns) and weave them together to form a single narrative tapestry of sorts.  I didn't invent this structure; you'll find it in the works of William S. Burroughs; Voice of the Fire by Alan Moore; The Martian Chronicles, From the Dust Returned, and, to a lesser extent, Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury; Sin City by Frank Miller (he even calls his "Yarns").  And probably plenty of other stuff that I don't know about.  Someone told me that there's a fantasy series called Thieves' World that does it, but I don't know because I haven't read it.<br/><br/>In playing The Rustbelt, I don't worry about any story arc emerging from the individual Yarns.  I find that they weave themselves together pretty nicely (granted, I like holes in it, unanswered questions, vagaries, ambiguities).  The only requirement is that they're all set in the Rustbelt, and that they are, taken by themselves, stories, with rising action, a climax, and all that jazz.  Sometimes they have the same characters, sometimes they're in the same cities, sometimes not.  Sometimes they're in chronological order, sometimes not.  Sometimes they contradict each other, and I let it happen.  Because they're Yarns!  <br/><br/>Like William S. Burroughs did when compiling various pieces of text to form Naked Lunch, I don't worry about reconciling the individual parts.  They will take care of themselves well enough.  A random draw of Tarot cards can be read to gain insights about a person, his past, his prospective futures; given a random pattern of dots, people will find pictures in it.<br/><br/>There's a technique to maintaining a continuity in this structure.  You'll find it throughout the works I noted above, especially in Burroughs and Moore.  I call it Tessellation.  It's where you repeat things in different contexts over the long term.  Phrases, descriptions, objects, names, situations, symbols, whatever.  Tessellation has a really neat effect:  the first time the symbol is repeated, it reminds you of its first appearance.  That first appearance puts a certain spin on the new appearance.  And the new appearance colors the first one retroactively.  You end up with a whole that is more than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>If I sound crazy, go read Voice of the Fire.  Grit your teeth and slog through that first chapter, it's worth it.  Watch carefully as the symbols are introduced, repeated, modified, aggregated.  Then read it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>with The Rustbelt, I embrace discrepancies.  Just calling the scenario a "Yarn" suggests that it's the sort of story that a not-entirely-trustworthy person in a bar would tell you.  Any discrepancies in setting and chronology can be attributed to him, as lies, errors, and embellishments. </blockquote> </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189461/#Comment_189461" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T17:26:35+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  5:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Marshall, that's what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>To paraphrase my OP, the Achewood RPG will not be GURPsivised.<br/><br/>Which makes me think of what must, I'm sure, be one of the worst fits of system to setting ever made (I haven't seen it, so I'm guessing): <a href="http://e23.sjgames.com/item.html?id=SJG37-0601" rel="nofollow">GURPS Casey and Andy</a>.<br/><br/><a href="http://galactanet.com/comic/" rel="nofollow">Casey and Andy</a> is a webcomic about "mad scientist roommates who periodically die!", one of whom is dating Satan.<br/><br/>GURPS is famous for its attempts to faithfully simulate real-world physics.<br/><br/>It's by David Morgan-Mar, whose <a href="http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/" rel="nofollow">Irregular Webcomic</a> I love to death.* He's a very clever guy and he may have pulled this off.

Basically almost every religious organisation, confession, order, church, etc, has its own (strict) canon about <i>how things really are</i>. These points of view don't match directly and can even contradict one another, and I think it's Ok. Sometimes I as a DM know "the truth", sometimes I don't even bother inventing it, given the esoteric nature of the universe and the simple fact that no-one is going to find out.<br/><br/>More related to game design is my second example: in one of the solo campaigns I'm running right now we somehow developed a tradition of me telling the player what his character saw in his dreams. What happens there, may or may not reflect the reality and he may or may not base his "real" decisions on anything he saw there. On the next game session (which is this weekend) we'll even try to use a different system. I picked a special indie game for role-playing cute little familiars, so he'll be dreaming of being a squirrel, for instance, and getting into some other mage's headquarters and being confronted by their familiars, who are possibly "real". We don't exactly define if this is happening in game reality or not, it's just some side story that may be of some significance to the main plot. If we like the experience, we can perhaps repeat the experience with some other indie rpg the next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_189818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189818/#Comment_189818" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T18:41:09+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  6:41PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2009 6:41PM by AnonAdderlan.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Canon only exists in the minds of the audience, anyhow.

And the only RPG I can think of that indirectly incorporates loose canon as an element of play is The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189824/#Comment_189824" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T19:05:52+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  7:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would suggest looking at the RPGA.  Thousands of groups will play the same module - many will save the day, and some won't, nevertheless, you can just wander over and play the next module as if the day was saved no matter what happened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
