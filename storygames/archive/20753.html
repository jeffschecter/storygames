Here are some of the RPGs I own to give you an idea of the type of games I'm interested in.<br/><br/>Games I own that I'm exited about reading and playing:<br/>Fate Core (I've read this and I'm excited to play it)<br/>Mouse Guard<br/>Houses of the Blooded <br/>Torchbearer <br/>REIGN <br/>Burning Wheel<br/>A Song of Ice and Fire <br/>Fiasco<br/>Blood &amp; Honor<br/>Pendragon <br/>Polaris<br/>Dungeon World<br/>Prime Time Adventures <br/>Kingdom <br/>Microscope (I've read and played this, the experience was OK but I played with people who had never played a RPG and it was the first time--still excited about it)<br/>Hillfoke<br/>The Dresden Files <br/>Legends of Anglerre<br/>Star Wars (FFG)<br/>7th Sea (2nd Edition) <br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Dread<br/>Downfall<br/>Universalis <br/>The One Ring<br/><br/>Games I own that are OK or I'm lukewarm about:<br/>D&amp;D (5th Edition) I've played this and it is OK, but the social mechanics are awful and the themes and mechanics in general are a bit tired)<br/><br/>Why did I buy these games?:<br/>Savage Worlds (Basically, the same old same old; no social mechanics; not doing anything new--although, based on the good reviews maybe I should give it a chance)<br/>War of Ashes: Fate of Agaptus (Fate Core looks awesome, but the whimsical, childlike tone is not my style)<br/><br/>I'm looking for RPGs with good social mechanics, courtly (or other types) of intrigue mechanics (so you can play people like Varys or Little Finger in ASOIAF), and possibility the chance to advance and manage a house or realm (but this is less important). I would also like to have a decent combat system. I'm interested in "indie" games, and some mainstream games that are unconventional, and offer something different. The types of genres I like are as follows (from most favorite to least favorite): Medieval-Fantasy with none-traditional races (think Houses of the Blooded) and original, unique ides OR Original Settings (think The Clay That Woke); Typical Fantasy; Sci-Fi; and Horror. I'm not interested in Superhero RPGs or Sci-Fi with traditional fantasy races (those themes just don't resonate with me). I know this is a lot to ask for (and games don't have to have all of these qualities as long as they are good), but I thought I might as well shoot for the stars. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :-)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455792/#Comment_455792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-25T23:01:51+00:00" title="August 25, 2016 11:01PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Monsterhearts</b> is like, all about social mechanics, but not in the intrigue sense at all.<br/><br/>I don't know <b>Sagas of the Icelanders</b> very well, but that sounds like it might also fit the bill.<br/><br/>Maybe check out <b>The Shadow of Yesterday</b> too?<br/><br/>But my real advice is that it seems like you have a <i>ton</i> of unplayed games already.

All the PCs (except the samurai) compete to climb their way up the ladder of favors for the samurai they hope will save them, with lots of decisions about how high to aim at a given moment, and major consequences for how they go about it.  Gaining the samurai's love and his pity are two very different things...<br/><br/>I've <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidBerg/posts/HYtkW1rChsu" rel="nofollow">heard good things</a> (see Ralph's 4th reply) about the social encounter system in <b>The One Ring</b> (dunno if you've already read through those rules).  I'm also excited about <b>Undying</b> for reasons of social machinations.<br/><br/>To expand on jangler's suggestion, in <b>Monsterhearts</b> you track leverage you have over other characters.  Simple but integral.<br/><br/>If you have a really tense, morally grey town, and PCs and NPCs who aren't too quick to violence, then <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b> can be good for social showdowns too (maybe that's obvious to you already; just figured I'd mention it).<br/><br/>Good old <b>Vampire: the Masquerade</b> had plenty of great inspiration for setting up schemes and tenuous alliances and power struggles and the like.  There's also a lot in the game that can distract from that if you let it, but you don't have to let it.  The social mechanics themselves aren't superb but they do bother to differentiate between more different ways of trying to get what you want than D&amp;D does.<br/><br/>Speaking of D&amp;D, both <b>Birthright</b> (actual D&amp;D product) and <b>Adventurer Conqueror King</b> (independent OSR game) emphasize advancing and managing a house or realm.<br/><br/>Hope you find something in there you enjoy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455812/#Comment_455812" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-26T18:26:06+00:00" title="August 26, 2016  6:26PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Separately, I have a project that would be <i>exactly</i> what you're looking for if I ever got it to work.  <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidBerg/posts/eTcoAuyiYuE" rel="nofollow">Blackmailed Kingdoms</a>.

I will think on it and get back to you.  The system defiantly needs to direct the play in a focused way for it to thrive. I'm wondering if it might be a good idea for the Emissary's roles and talents to be differentiated in some further way (i.e. besides where they hail from).

It's really one of the freshest and most exciting current RPG developments for me (not finalized yet, first version available on DTRPG).<br/><br/>My current multi-purpose-go-to-system is <b>Fate Core</b>. I also still enjoy <b>Dresden Files</b> very much.<br/><br/>Among the PbtA (Powered by the Apocalypse) games, I like these as a starting point:<br/><b>Apocalypse World</b> (possibly 2nd edition): still covers some basic concepts like fronts best for me.<br/> <b>Dungeon World</b>: accessible fantasy setting &amp; very good introduction guide for free (highly recommended for PbtA).<br/><br/>Whereas PbtA is tightly locked to setting and works best for me with 2-3 players, I find Fate more universal and better for i.e. 5-6 players. Another multi-purpose RPG system I like is <b>Cortex Plus</b> (Leverage or Cortex Plus Action RP specifically).<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> is always worth playing and fun.<br/><br/>Another personal favorite is <b>Maid RPG</b>. A Japanese RPG where you play... well, maids.
