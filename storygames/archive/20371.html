It requires an RPG ruleset but it's system-agnostic.  I imagine something like Traveller but you could probably do it with a fantasy setting or anything else.  The important part (I think) is that the RPG system should have very simple, cut-and-dry, combat rules.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: This is a first pass.  I don't expect it to be 100% playable yet, as I'm sure there are missing bits and unconsidered edge cases.  But I think it's done enough to start playtesting.  Let's tweak it!<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PPJXDT_0tlE/VgVV5Mxl73I/AAAAAAAACTA/cc5Eh8rw-Fo/w506-h547/Dragonfly_Hex_init_config.PNG"/><br/><br/>Two groups are warring for control of an alien planet.  Neither is very familiar with the local lifeforms.  Write statblocks for each piece using your chosen RPG system.  When you move a piece into or through a hex no one has occupied before, roll its terrain and climate (perhaps using the <a href="http://www.welshpiper.com/hex-based-campaign-design-part-1/\ufeff" rel="nofollow">Welsh Piper rules</a>), and draw the terrain icon on the board.  In addition, every time a piece ends its move, make an encounter roll based on terrain and climate.  If an encounter occurs, that unit must defeat or bypass the encounter before proceeding.  If an encounter occurs in a hex occupied by two opposing pieces (i.e., a capture has just been attempted), roll 1d6 to determine which side is affected by the encounter: (1-2) attacker, (3-4) defender, (5-6) both. If both sides are involved in the encounter, it's up to the players to determine whether or not they cooperate; think Braunstein-level roleplay.  When a unit defeats an encounter, roll 1d6 for the value of the treasure found there.  If both sides shared in the victory, each side gets 1d3.  These "treasure points" accumulate and may be used to purchase new pieces (using traditional chess scoring rules: pawn=1, bishop or knight=3, rook=5). New pieces must be purchased at the beginning of one's turn, and must enter the board via one of the original starting positions for that piece.<br/><br/>For extra flava, consider adding a GM.<br/><br/><b>Dragonfly Chess</b> by Christian Freeling<br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_%28chess_variant%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(chess_variant)</a><br/><br/>based on <b>Gli\u0144ski's Hexagonal Chess</b> by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gli\u0144ski<br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess#Gli.C5.84ski.27s_hexagonal_chess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess#Gli.C5.84ski.27s_hexagonal_chess</a>\ufeff<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448760/#Comment_448760" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T19:42:26+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  7:42PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting idea!

When an encounter is included in a hex, those monsters should remain there. (Although perhaps only the player encountering them knows? That would be interesting, making the game into an intelligence-gathering battle, as well.)<br/><br/>That way, your strategy could be guided by the need to avoid particularly powerful monsters, or the possibility of luring the enemy into combat with them.<br/><br/>2. When a capture takes place, it should play out as a combat between the capturing piece and the captured piece (as in Battle Chess, if anyone remembers that).<br/><br/>The capturing piece "swoops in" and gains automatic surprise (or a bonus on the surprise roll), but the outcome of the fight is still (at least potentially) variable.<br/><br/>If different pieces have different "stats" or "strengths", this gets more interesting. It's relatively low-risk to capture your opponent's Queen with a pawn, perhaps... but you're less likely to succeed than if you send your knight.<br/><br/>And maybe the opponent is parading that pawn in front of you in a hex that contains a rare and dangerous monster, to lure your Queen into a trap.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448795/#Comment_448795" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-28T21:19:44+00:00" title="September 28, 2015  9:19PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2015 9:22PM by AsIf.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            /totally nodding along.

(Because, given the value of Treasure Points, attacking those "insurgent" hexes becomes a very important strategy: if you can defeat the monster, you'll quite possibly get a new piece to add.)<br/><br/>Have you considered including traps and/or just plain treasure as well, in your "encounter" table?<br/><br/>It would be fun to include Wandering Monsters, too, but I can't see an easy and fun way to do that right off the top of my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448797/#Comment_448797" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-28T21:55:25+00:00" title="September 28, 2015  9:55PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2015 12:10AM by AsIf.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I've got "a game" here, but more like a collection of optional rules for different kinds of hexcrawl chess games.  Because the rules used for the RPG will also determine what makes sense, and I cannot predict what RPG you might use.<br/><br/>In my original concept all monsters were wandering.  There were only ever two players.  It was really just chess with wandering monsters based on terrain.  But I had been reading a lot of hexcrawl rules (and writing a few) lately, so it expanded to what I posted above.  I was beginning to think about prepping (in a literal sense, i.e. before the game) when I wrote "For extra flava, consider adding a GM."  I didn't hit that nail very hard, but I thought of it.  It made me think of the "Death Arenas" I would design for others to do battle on back in the <i>Car Wars</i> days, which would involve traps and treasure (weapons, actually).  This game could be totally prepped by a third-party GM, not just selecting the RPG rules and adjudicating encounters, but even to the extent of designing custom pregen armies for the Players, if desired.<br/><br/>I have also been considering both "lairs" and "wandering" monsters.  I think they work together <i>almost</i> naturally already: for instance the ghouls are a "lair" because they were found on the same hex as a terrain feature (a temple).  But the wyvern that shows up in turn 10 is clearly wandering.  Although the initial concept was more Traveller/science fiction, I've been using the <a href="static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/324791/13904270/1385774219083/Wilderness_Hexplore_revised.pdf" rel="nofollow">Wilderness Hexplore Revised</a> rules, which do a good job of suggesting whether you're dealing with a lair or a wanderer.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
