And I'm honestly interested in talking about why that is.<br/><br/>Is it:\n<ul><li>because you're sick of games not really delivering on what they promise, so you've decided to take things into your own hands, so to speak, and take a more direct hand in shaping how the game is experienced at the table?</li>\n<li>because you have a strong "the author is dead" feeling, in the sense of modern literary theory, like game designers have been put on a pedestal and people spend way to much time trying to decipher what they really mean, when it's way more important to look at what actually happens at the table?</li>\n<li>because you feel like you know everything worth knowing about roleplaying (or, at least, roleplaying the way you want to play), so that you can't really learn anything by adopting new or different techniques or approaches?</li>\n<li>because you've played too many games where people don't actually tell you how to play, so you're like "Forget this! I'll figure it out myself!" and tend to skip to the parts of a game text that seem important to you?</li>\n<li>because some game designer was too cool to sign your copy of Vampire 1st Edition as a kid?</li></ul>\nI assume it's probably something more interesting than all of those, actually, but just wanted to throw some possibilities out there.  I mean, you seem like a smart dude who's thought a bunch about games, so it can't just be for some superficial or dumb reason.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322705/#Comment_322705" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-02T20:52:45+00:00" title="May  2, 2011  8:52PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2011 8:55PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it was because the first time any prolonged communication took place between gamers and game designers - on Usenet in the early 90s - it became amazingly clear amazingly fast that the designers had no real idea how the games were actually being played, and were really quite horrified at what they found.  At one point I was in the killfile of every White Wolf developer and freelancer that had ever done any work for their game, just because I talked a lot about their games and had lots of brilliant, <i>brilliant I say</i> ideas for them.  It didn't bother me, I took a gleeful sort of pride in it, and kept giving them money for really good stuff.<br/><br/>This led me to think about the difference between what I did as a GM and as a player and what the game designers did. Once I worked that out, it became overwhelmingly clear that the designer's contribution was, whether significant or insignificant, <i>static</i>, whereas the key element of RPG play (as compared to board or card games) is that it's <i>dynamic</i>.  (In this respect the "author is dead" option is closest.)  I don't exactly know what the borders of RPG play are, nobody really does because "game" is inherently a fuzzy word applied to all sorts of very different things, but one characteristic I've been able to discern is that at any given moment, the choices of the players are virtually infinite.  The power of dialogue alone is enough to scuttle any designer's intended experience, make the most serious dramas into hilarious comedies or wild-eyed surrealiana, and it's pretty rare that RPGs don't give you even more power than that, they <i>let you make characters</i>, which is a sure sign that they've given up, or more generously, they recognize the limits of their reach.  I mean, characters! Isn't that a dead giveaway?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322707/#Comment_322707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-02T21:15:58+00:00" title="May  2, 2011  9:15PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

I mean, leaving aside the I think quite spurious notion that the designer knows the "right" way to play a game (have you <i>seen</i> what Ron Edwards writes about Sorcerer in places other than Sorcerer books?), what if they just don't care that much or are just chillaxin' on the Internet waiting for some porn to download or something?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>In any event, what is the "good stuff" that you got (and still get?) out of game texts, then?</blockquote>\nOh man, new techniques, new ideas, new relationships between players, new approaches, new challenges...pretty much all kinds of shit to pile in the toolbox.  Static stuff is good, I mean, novels are amazing, aren't they?  <br/><br/>So looking at the books I have piled up here that I've been working on recently, let me give some cool stuff I got from those:<br/><br/>Cthulhutech: What I love about this setting is that it very carefully kicks the struts out from under certain areas of civilization that Lovecraft really worried might die in the new age of enlightenment.  It's a really good piece of social science fiction. You're in this tightly controlled society that is tightly controlled to keep everyone from going insane and murdering each other.  <br/><br/>Wild Talents Essential Edition: I like the power-building character generation game (always love those), I especially like that this isn't a wildly overblown one like GURPS Powers or Champions, yet  you can still make the power as fiddly as you want.  I also like the way that you get invulnerable people to be vulnerable by kidnapping their girlfriend and/or taking their workplace hostage, yet they can fight through it and still beat you.<br/><br/>Smallville: I like how every time you roll anything in this game you are telling the table WHY you are doing it. It's like the speech bubble from With Great Power given new life as a die-rolling system.  This is a game about expressing what your character thinks and feels at every moment of their soap operatic laser beam shooting experience, soooo good.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>As a follow up, have you played (and enjoyed?) any games that are super specific about their procedures?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely, as I noted above, I like trying out new procedures so that I can fuss with them, fix them up, put them where they don't belong, cross them out with a black magic marker, depending on my goals. Same is true for playing with other groups, I want to see how they do things.  You can learn so much from other groups and other GMs and other approaches. It's why I put the local GM Conference together, because, selfishly, I wanted to learn from other people's approaches and ideas. Michael Jordan played a lot of basketball, Bobby Fischer played a lot of chess, Muhammad Ali got punched by a shitload of people.  <br/><br/>At the first GM's Conference, John Wick drove down from Phoenix and he gave a 45 minute presentation that was SO GOOD because I didn't agree with virtually <i>any</i> of it. But in disagreeing with it I could solidify why I felt the way I felt.  Great experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322713/#Comment_322713" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-02T22:02:37+00:00" title="May  2, 2011 10:02PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason!<br/><br/>I usually end up agreeing with you on most things. But here's a thing:<br/><br/>I'm as down with "death of the author" as anybody, and I think it has pretty big implications for rpg play. I think, as a whole, we're probably too hung up on "author's intent", to the detriment of experimental play.<br/><br/>But!<br/><br/>You gotta admit that, say, Dogs gives a group a different experience to Fiasco, for example, and it's different in a way that's reproducable and to some extent predictable. There's a big range within Dogs play, and a big range within Fiasco play, but you can have a sensible conversation on the internet about the kind of play that you're likely to get out of a game of Dogs.<br/><br/>For example, if you describe a game of Dogs going down, it's pretty unlikely that people are going to mistake that for a description of a game of Fiasco, yeah?<br/><br/>In other words, we don't need to give a fig for what the author "intended" gameplay to be like in order to recognise that different game texts do, on the whole, produce distinct and identifiable experiences in play.<br/><br/>Right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322715/#Comment_322715" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-02T22:19:58+00:00" title="May  2, 2011 10:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, cool.  A couple other questions, right now, following from some of the discussion earlier.  Is it all really ONE toolbox?  I mean, don't some of those techniques and procedures and bits of styles and stuff just flat-out not go together?<br/><br/>Also, it's not like you're the only one with a toolbox, yeah? So does every player that you sit down at a table with, and you all have different tools.  If you don't know, just from the name on the cover of the game you're playing, what kinds of tools the other folks will pull out, how does it all come together?<br/><br/>Also, related, when you sit down to play something, surely a lot of this stuff is more or less appropriate based on the game you're playing, the people at the table, the premise of the session, etc.  Isn't it a lot more work if you're basically assembling the game techniques from scratch most times rather than playing a game based on a shared understanding of the kinds of things that are appropriate for this game?<br/><br/>To give a slightly more concrete example, the idea of running Vampire or D&amp;D (3, 4, whatever) without something as explicit and mechanical as AW-style fronts and threats, procedures I can follow to create and help manage all the NPCs and conflicting interests and conditions and whatnot, sounds like WAY too much work to me.  Inventing all that stuff from scratch and then keeping it all juggling in the air would take a lot of time and attention that I'd rather spend on other things like playing my characters and thinking up interesting stuff.  Do you think that you -- and maybe other folks who run these kids of games all the time -- have internalized a lot of the techniques involved in the juggling so you can do it without much thought while you focus on other things? (If so, how long did that take and was it enjoyable along the way, while you were still learning to juggle?)

Flathead and phillips head and all that metaphorical shit.  I change up what I pull out of the toolbox for every game that I'm in, and the moment that I'm in, depending on my goals and the goals of the group at that exact time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

It ain't rocket science, we say, "did that work" or "what did you like about that" or "were you into that or not" and so on.  I try to make it really clear up front what we're doing.<br/><br/>I do this in con games too.  Here's what I said at the beginning of my Call of Cthulhu game last time:<br/><br/>"Hey, I'm Jason and this is my Call of Cthulhu game. Call of Chtulhu is a really fun game in which you are playing characters like those that might appear in the horror stories of the groundbreaking 1920s pulp author H.P. Lovecraft.  I'm going to be the GM. My job is to portray the other characters and give you creepy situations to dig around in, and dangers.  Your characters all have reasons to dig around in creepy situations and get into trouble, so play those up! You also all know each other and have opinions about each other, those are on the back of your sheet.  I like when people talk to each other in character, so please don't feel silly about giving it a try.  If you don't like it, or aren't sure what to say, that's all right too, just speak up when the time comes.  This is a four hour block - I try to take a 5-10 minute break every hour, and I try to end before the block is over.  If you don't understand something or are confused, let me know.  The second page of your packet is a simple cheat sheet about the system, which I'll go over now, but I'm happy to explain more at any time."<br/><br/>Like, you get really specific about what you want, what they are going to get, where they should look to know things, and when you want it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Also, related, when you sit down to play something, surely a lot of this stuff is more or less appropriate based on the game you're playing, the people at the table, the premise of the session, etc.  Isn't it a lot more work if you're basically assembling the game techniques from scratch most times rather than playing a game based on a shared understanding of the kinds of things that are appropriate for this game?</blockquote>\nTheoretically, I guess? I mean, what you're saying is that "if everyone already knows how to do algebra, aren't algebra problems much easier?"  Sure, yes, that's true.  And (for example) after I played Star Wars Saga with a group one time, I didn't have to re-learn and re-work much when I came back to the same group to play Star Wars Saga again with the same goals.  But I did still have to re-work things somewhat because our goals for the second game were not the same as the goals for the first, and of course there's the session-to-session, moment-to-moment adjustments that must be, thrillingly, made.  It's dynamic, like I say.  You can't really replace it with a "shared understanding" in the sense that we all read a text and nod our heads and say, yes, let's do <i>this</i> now.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I mean, I've been GMing since 1988 and I <i>hope</i> I've gotten better at it over time.  Games with GMs have a lot of different techniques, I'm still learning them, and some I'm really good at.  But I do question that a whole lot has to be juggled in those games you listed. D&amp;D3 has the core "go adventuring, get treasure" thing that provides a strong through-line, and you only have to manage oppositions and conflicts that arise along that line.  Vampire had its Themes and Tones to help you organize the campaign world.  Certainly there are games that do not have these things (GURPS and similar approaches) - what happens in that case is I as game organizer provide a strong direction, I have to have a strong idea of what the game's about.  Some collaboration helps here too, though designing by committee often does lead to a ton of juggling.<br/><br/>The main thing that helped me get organized was to think about my goal for the game.

Quotes (paraphrased)\u2026<br/><br/><i>"Originally I wanted to play by the rules, but with core books spanning 300+ pages and supplement after supplement updating, revising, re-explaining, adding errata, contradicting and expanding the rules\u2026 it became nearly impossible. It was more work than my job." <br/><br/>"The rules seem endless and poorly written with terrible indexes and are difficult to reference! I can't keep this all straight. I once wrote a house rule that later the designer told us was actually a rule in the game but we just couldn't find it in their ocean of rules." <br/><br/>"It's important to me to get the game right! Which means I have to re-read the book at least 2 to 3 times before I feel comfortable even thinking about playing our first game. And I still get it wrong! But honestly, when we finally do get it right we realize many of these rules are terrible! What do you mean after I roll a natural 20, I need to confirm my critical? What do you mean I have to re-roll my Spot skill every 5 feet?"<br/><br/>"I played with the designers at a convention and even they don't play by their own rules! And hell, the house rules we came up with ended up being in the second edition. The fact that games even have new editions means they can be changed and still work fine."<br/><br/>"The rules seemed wrong to me but we kept playing them thinking we were missing something. Then we found out how little playtesting they did and we feel like suckers. Never again. If the rules don't seem right, we will make them right."<br/><br/>"This game is 95% perfect for our group except this one part. It's less work to change this game than search for and possibly never find the perfect game. And the perfect game doesn't exist. No game was made specifically for us. So we need to be the ones to make games fit us."<br/><br/>"The game designer doesn't know my group. We're friends first, players second. We get together to hang out. Most of us like different things in games but we make it work because being friends is more important. So no game is going to work for us. It can't. We all want different things."</i><br/><br/>Some of these problems have to do with inaccessible or hard to use rules. <br/><br/>BUT Prime Time Adventures is only 48 pages. And I've played PTA with a lot of you. I don't think I've ever personally played with anyone (beyond Thor and Luke) on Story Game that ran PTA rules as written. I'm not saying that is a bad thing. I've had incredible PTA games with many of you. More often than not, the rules changes are on purpose (especially because PTA isn't meant to be played as a one shot and we often play it at conventions). But I've also met people (most not on Story Games) that were convinced they were playing PTA, rules as written, and they weren't. And it's only a 48 pages! <br/><br/>I know I've gamed with many designers who have worked on D&amp;D, Pathfinder, Shadowrun and many other games. And even they didn't play rules as written!<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I've run Dogs over a 100 times and when I run it now I make changes. I didn't for the first 20 games and most of the changes I do make are incorporating rules from Afraid, Vincent's horror game using the Dogs ruleset or making it easier to run at conventions. I believe it is important to know how a game works before you tamper with it (although sometimes tampering is a great way to understand how a game works). <br/><br/>But there are also a lot of bad house rules out there. I've been in many D&amp;D games where the DM's house rules completely invalidated many of our characters because they didn't understand how the game worked. But there are also a lot of bad games, bad designers, bad players, and bad GMs out there as well. The bad isn't an indicator of what the good can do. And people who do know what they are doing don't always get it right. And sometimes the people who have no idea get lucky! It's hard to make absolute statements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322769/#Comment_322769" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T07:56:56+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  7:56AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, man.

So for example, Vampire's resolution system in which the average person can achieve some small measure of success an average amount of the time and combat is not super deadly for the most part produces one set of outcomes, which are more or less felicitous depending on how close that is to what we want.  Definitely when I switched Trinity from the Storyteller 1.5 system (my own name for it) to GURPS, it was in part because I wanted combat to be deadlier and skills to be more varied.<br><br/>I mean, the conclusion of all of this isn't that System Don't Matter, I mean Doesn't Matter, because it clearly does.

It's a <i>dialectical</i> relationship. There are virtually infinite things a person <i>could</i> say when they're playing a game, but they don't. I'm not in the habit (usually) of uttering random exhortations at the table. What I say is shaped by the expectations of play. The text, the fact that we've all sat down at the table motivated by this text (to a greater or lesser extent), our (more or less) shared understanding of play, creates a powerful expectation between us. Now, that expectation encompasses a pretty broad range, but it's wrong to say it "overwhelms" the text on the page. It's powerfully shaped by the text on the page.<br/><br/>I propose an empirical test!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322884/#Comment_322884" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T13:52:56+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  1:52PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a phrasing you like for what game design <i>does</i> contribute, so we can talk more easily about this in the future?

I'm not in the habit (usually) of uttering random exhortations at the table. What I say is shaped by the expectations of play. The text, the fact that we've all sat down at the table motivated by this text (to a greater or lesser extent), our (more or less) shared understanding of play, creates a powerful expectation between us. Now, that expectation encompasses a pretty broad range, but it's wrong to say it "overwhelms" the text on the page. It's powerfully shaped by the text on the page.</blockquote>\nIt can be, sure. But it isn't necessarily. Groups choose how much their actions are shaped by what's on the page at any given time. Sometimes they choose to really adhere as closely as they can to what's on the page. That's what Jesse was talking about in the earlier thread. Their goal is: "We're going to learn to play this the way Mark Rein-bjork-Hagen would have wanted us to! Leave no comma unturned in our search for the true meaning of this text! If the game runs into a wall, and we're all miserable, so be it, it is the price we pay for personal growth and our search for knowledge!"  My point is that choice is not fundamentally a different choice from the guy who says "Ouch, you rolled really bad there, that would suck. Roll it again, I know it's against the rules, but whatever, we're here to chill with our bros and drink beers."  Both players are pursuing their goals, the text is only a tool that both of them use in their own way.<br/><br/>The text can't talk back to either of these players, it says what it says - it cannot respond to a player's desires in any way, only other players can do that.  <br/><br/>I like your diagram, with your caveat that all these things are muddled up and changing all the time. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Is there a phrasing you like for what game design<i>does</i>contribute, so we can talk more easily about this in the future?  I like "tool in the toolkit" for techniques that can be invoked on an as-needed basis in play, but I'd rather classify an entire resolution system as something else.  "Every time we fight we use GURPS combat rules" needs a better description than "that's one tool we use", IMO.</blockquote>\nWhy not just say "resolution system" when that's what you're talking about? I try to just talk about what it is I'm talking about and not overgeneralize, because I know tons of groups don't play the way my group does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322953/#Comment_322953" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T18:09:09+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  6:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Muddled up and changing all the time: Yes.<br/><br/>I think that before and during play, players come to a shared understanding about what the game is. A lot of the time, that's influenced strongly by a game text. Someone says "Let's play Dogs", and sure, that means a different thing to each person, but it's close enough that functional play is possible.<br/><br/>Someone says "Let's play Apocalypse World" and everyone's idea of what that game will be is influenced by that game text, but also by a bunch of other post-apocalyptic media. But then AW does this neat thing where character creation often guides people towards a more cohesive creative vision.<br/><br/>Someone says "Let's play Vampire!" and they're probably gonna have to do a bunch more talking before functional play is possible, simply because the space of possible games within Vampire is so huge. <br/><br/>But then there's this other thing: Someone says "Let's play Star Wars, <i>using</i> Dogs." Now we're in a wholly more complex space. What does Star Wars mean to people? What does Dogs mean in this context? I suggest a lot of talking, or a strong directorial voice is required in order to make that game work.<br/><br/>Would I be right, Jason, in thinking that your normal approach is closer to the latter? You have a concept of the game that you want to play, and while a game text is one of the tools you're using to get to that, the idea of the game itself is not neccessarily directly inspired by a single text?<br/><br/>Also, of course, our idea of "what the game is" is constantly changing, altered by the events of the game, and other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322955/#Comment_322955" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T18:13:28+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  6:13PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Would I be right, Jason, in thinking that your normal approach is closer to the latter?

The reason I've adopted this practice is because I found it really, REALLY improves the game experience.<br/><br/>For example, "Let's play PTA", meh, I could be excited, or I might not.  If someone says, "I've got this great PTA idea, spy shenanigans and bedroom farce in pre-WWI Europe", I might let out a whoop and run to the table.  Same with "Let's play Dogs".  Meh, maybe, what you got for me? "I got this great idea for a character for Dogs, he's a sickly fellow whose parents never expected him to live and he doesn't even have a first name."  Whoop, let's do this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
