                    I've got this terrible game idea that won't vacate my head called Web of Shadows, which is designed to create the kinds of stories that the World of Darkness books always promised and failed to deliver on.  The stories, I might add, that I stopped caring about a couple years ago.<br/><br/>In any case, the new version is available <a href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/?p=95" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  It has players represent the current situation with a web of 3x5 cards tied together with lengths of string, and challenges players to pick up characters and roleplay in scenes in order to shift that web of cards to their own benefit.  The Audience, which changes each scene, chooses whose roleplay was the most successful in doing so.  Needless to say, it's a little... different, and I'm curious to see what folks think about it.                </div>

                            I am in love with it, for various reasons. I need to write a better response, but I wanted to get the positive vibes out there now.<br/>

Love!                        </div>
