So, whenever they <b>help</b> or <b>interfere with</b> someone who's making a roll.  This in addition to highlighted stats.  I did this because:<br/><br/>1) My Sunday group doesn't meet as often as some groups.<br/><br/>2) For better or worse (I do try to work on it, so I guess mostly for worse) I know my GM-style trends toward a slow burn with fewer in-your-face conflicts.  That makes for fewer rolls whatever the system and I was trying to keep the game on track for those sixth + advances.<br/><br/>3) Just to find out what would happen.  Extra carrot.  Depending on the Hx level at the time of the roll, and how hard your MC moves, some would say the RAW make helping and hindering a risky prospect.  By design, no doubt.  It really says something about your character in Apocalypse World when you decide to get involved with another character's designs.<br/><br/>I'm mostly happy with the decision.  The PCs have helped and interfered with each other a little more and have formed and re-formed factions here and there depending on the area of interest.<br/><br/>I got to thinking (again) about the genius of TSoY's Keys and other possible applications.<br/><br/>Imagine two games, both set to typically run four or more sessions.  Always an even number of sessions though.  <br/><br/>In one game all of the PCs have the Key of Helping (other PCs) in the first half of the game and the Key of Hindering (other PCs) in the second half of the game.  In the second game, the mechanic is reversed, with all the PCs having the Key of Hindering in the first half of the game and the Key of Helping in the second half.<br/><br/>If it sounds interesting, tell me about these two games.  The genre, the starting situation, whatever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350458/#Comment_350458" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T15:31:17+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  3:31PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2011 3:58PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That *is* interesting, Matthew.

The characters are abducted by misterious entities and made to compete against each other. At first, they (being no real enemies) start helping each other, but as the race progresses, it becomes clear that only one will survive. Do you want to live or would you rather allow another person to steal that chance from you?<br/><br/><b>Hindering -&gt; Helping</b><br/><br/>A sort of Survival Horror. Once everyone gets over their interpersonal conflicts, they actually start cooperating and working as a team, which will allow them to face the menace and survive. That is, if they actually survived long enough to get to that stage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
