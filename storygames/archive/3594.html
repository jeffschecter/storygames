In part, this is to be certain that they are captured somewhere for me to review later; but as I have a number of locations for such things, it is also to capture the thoughts of this community around these ideas.<br/><br/>Idea 1:  Having watched the first episode of season two of Eureka last night, I find myself pondering a game/setting/something based on a Eureka-for-supers; call it arbitrarially "Kirbyville".  The idea is that supers are real and were active in a previous age - personally I lean toward the early Silver age - but that for their protection and the protection of the populace, they were gathered/isolated in an idyllic community.  Somewhat the feel of Top Ten or Astro City, but instead of it being a metropolis it looks more like the set of Leave it to Beaver.  Perhaps under the research center up the hill is an underground containment center for the less amiable inhabitants of the town.<br/><br/>Idea 2:  I have been pondering for sometime the idea of inter-personal relationship "charging" super-powers.  This is the idea that by interacting with another character or set of characters, resources are earned that can be used to activate powers later in the game.  An obvious example is "The Madder Hulk Gets, the Stronger Hulk Gets" - he interacts with "The Army" and get mad - the mad tokens then charge his Strength.  I'm imagining more subtle things, though like Ben and Johnny fighting early in the story.<br/>T&amp;J - an excellent game - does this the other way, MJ is often endangered because Spideyman chooses her as his first wound.  One could argue Capes does this to some extent, and I think With Great Power might, but I need to go back and read the rules again.  however, I'm not sure either of them is necessarially explicit about the path of resources.<br/><br/>Idea 3: I became fixated on the idea of tokens as countdown to climax after reading <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3565" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.  I find myself wondering if this could be used to pace the 'issue' of a comic-book game.  The players are working toward countdown, while trying to build up for the big fight (some sort of balance here) - at the same time, the bad guy is working toward his goal, encouraging the heroes to not dawdle.  The idea is rough and feels like it may be more of a card game than a story game, but it's stuck in my head.<br/><br/>Do these thoughts inspire any spin-offs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80983/#Comment_80983" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T14:51:36+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  2:51PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off I really like your initial idea about a city of superheroes, but instead of Metropolis it's like Smallville!<br/><br/>Secondly, I like the idea of interaction "charging" your powers. A bit like refreshing pools in TSOY.<br/><br/>Something I tried with my <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/reversed.html" rel="nofollow">Reversed Engineer</a> entry of superpowered teenagers, <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/growingpainsANDREWKENRICK.pdf" rel="nofollow">Growing Pains</a>, was having your powers draw on your relationships, so by using them you put your relationships under threat. The whole game revolved around powering up your angst and counting down your transformation until you hit the endgame, powered up into your battle mode and kicked metaphorical and actual butt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81058/#Comment_81058" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T06:37:17+00:00" title="July 13, 2007  6:37AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of Kirbyville, all the way down to its name.  But I think one of the reasons Eureka works as a concept is (a) unlike superheroes, scientists need labs, so there's a good reason for concentration (we'd need an equivalent justification, though maybe you already have one - the town also is the location of the supervillain prison).  Also (b) for all that the supporting cast is filled with the uberscientists, the actual main character is a total "normal" by comparison, and has a small troupe of "norms" as well - namely his daughter and his deputy.  However, people don't generally sit down to play a "supers" game and not play the supers - how would you tweak the "Eureka" narrative structure to handle that?  Or would you?  (Give norms more narrative power, like the sheriff and his daughter, and give the supers just more... power power?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81060/#Comment_81060" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T06:48:09+00:00" title="July 13, 2007  6:48AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite>However, people don't generally sit down to play a "supers" game and not play the supers - how would you tweak the "Eureka" narrative structure to handle that?</blockquote>\nPerhaps the twist is that the normal people are more versatile, like the Sheriff coming up with the "stupid" ideas that actually work. The superheroes, being so absorbed by their archetypal roles, are pretty much stuck on rails. You <i>know</i> Captain Midnight is only going to be patrolling in total darkness. You <i>know</i> The Patriot will always make his presence known and give the villain a chance to escape. In a way, they've got a mental disorder. For all their power, they can't break free of their roles. <br/><br/>It almost sounds like Kirbyville is an extended-care community. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
