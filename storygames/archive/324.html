                    This is a spinoff of another thread, because the more I thought about it, the more I thought, "I'll bet there's an unchecked assumption here."<br/><br/>Given a universe of semi-connected game design and play styles which is very wide, and given a conceptual framework in which you feel there's a place for pretty much everything, or at least for a whole lot of it...<br/><br/>How much of that universe do you feel you ought to be able to design for and play in? Do you think of yourself as someone whose tastes and realm of conceptual flourishing is a lil' piece of the whole, someone who is or ought to be capable of striding across the whole map, or somewhere in between? Do you feel that you have something to offer everyone, or lots of folks, or do you see yourself as best addressing a fairly narrow set of listeners?<br/><br/>What do you feel about your situation now, what do you feel you (or anyone else with the right clues) is capable of, and what do you feel you ought to be doing to bridge the gap, if there is one?<br/><br/>Personally, I find my focus contracting with time, for a variety of reasons, some positive and some negative. But I think that expansive visions are important and worthwhile too, and above all I'm fascinated by others' self-definition on my way to a sharper definition for myself. I hope none of this sounds perjorative - if it does, holler and I'll fix it if I can.                </div>

                            Not all games are for me. It's been an important realization in my growth as a gamer. In the same way, while I think that I have a lot to offer, some/a lot of people will find no value in it, because "my" gaming is not for them.<br/>
<br/>
I've made peace with that.                        </div>

                            I'm going to answer by corrolary.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a prose author.  I write short stories and I write novels.  I've sold little bits and pieces, and I hope to sell more in the future.  But with that as my stated goal, I don't only read prose fiction.  I read poetry, I read plays, I read nonfiction, too.  And I occasionally take a hand at writing these other things, too.  Not because it's my primary goal, but because the experience of reading, writing, and simply experiencing them can inform what I am really and truly interested in.<br/>
<br/>
So too am I very interested in understanding and even trying out types of games that I might not want to play week in and week out.  I even dicker with writing games that I'm not too interested in playing.  In the end, I think it makes me a better game player and game designer.<br/>
<br/>
On a more pragmatic note, I've written games for my wife; they fit her desires and habits of play very very well.  They're only an adequate "fit" for me.  But if I only ever wrote what I liked, I wouldn't be able to do that for her.                        </div>

                            I probably think about this more than I should. And this post turned into somewhat of an extended, mixed metaphor....but anyway...<br/><br/><code>How much of that universe do you feel you ought to be able to design for and play in? Do you think of yourself as someone whose tastes and realm of conceptual flourishing is a lil' piece of the whole, someone who is or ought to be capable of striding across the whole map, or somewhere in between? Do you feel that you have something to offer everyone, or lots of folks, or do you see yourself as best addressing a fairly narrow set of listeners?</code><br/><br/>I feel like, <b>when I'm a mature designer</b> (this is key), I <i>ought</i> to choose which little (or big) peice of the pie I'm aiming for, and hit it right on the nose. My tastes are all over the map, and I want each of my games to stand alone, complete in themselves, hitting the target I've chosen for them. Some of my games will have more to offer to more people than others; others will have something very cool to offer a few people; others will offer a broad range to many people. <br/><br/><code>What do you feel about your situation now, what do you feel you (or anyone else with the right clues) is capable of, and what do you feel you ought to be doing to bridge the gap, if there is one?</code><br/><br/>I feel that, right now, I'm taking my ranging shots - OK, so <i>this</i> game hits <i>this</i> conceptual area and audience, and now <i>that</i> game should hit another one. I feel like, once I have my ratios set arights and my trajectories calculated, I will be capable of fulfilling any goals that I find personally interesting and valuable to design for. The calibration process, however, is a long one that will take much work before I'm satisfied that I can hit the mark.                        </div>

                            I like games. Whatever you got, bring it. I'll play and probably have lots of fun. The more a game tells me about what "good play" looks like -- for that game -- the more fun I tend to have.<br/>
<br/>
As a designer, I would never dream of designing an RPG for "all gamers" or anything like that. To me, a good game design first defines an experience of play ("You sneak around and sabotage terrorist operations -- you are a Splinter Cell") and then has mechanics to support that play.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I'm very broad as a player and focused as a designer.                        </div>

                            John: Oh, I think I may have been unclear. I didn't mean "how much do you feel you can address in one game", but "over time, working with many designs, each as focused as you want, aimed at whatever goals you have for each, how much do you feel you can address well?" The cumulative result of design and play effort hopefully spent well, that is.                        </div>

Hmmm. That's a good question.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I think my goal is to hit one thing well in a given game design, and then move on to something totally different in the next one. So, I can't be sure how much I can address in my lifetime as a designer -- who knows how long it will be? -- but I can say that I will at least try to always be expanding my territory.                        </div>

                            Mmmm. There's a different between can't play and won't play. I can't play most of my drafts, but they are all for games I would play.                        </div>

<p>I see a wide universe of design techniques and play styles.</p>
<p>I am only interested in designing for my play style. Anything else would be disloyal to myself.</p>
<p>But if I left a design technique unturned, that would be equally bad.</p>

                            I've designed several games I wouldn't play.  I call them "crappy games."<br>
<br>
Bruce -- my goal as a game player is to play as wide a range of games as possible.  Ultimately, as a game designer, certain problems interest me and certain problems don't (namely -- social games interest me -- so I'm going to stick to social games if I can), but that's pretty much the only restriction.<br>
