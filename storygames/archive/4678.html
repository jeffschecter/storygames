While I was listening, I was of course thinking about how prison life could be turned into an RPG, especially when one of the inmates starts describing minnows and whales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105469/#Comment_105469" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T22:51:46+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 10:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael,<br><br>I've been working on such a game on and off for a while now on a game called <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16782.0" rel="nofollow">The Big House</a> trying to capture that Oz and Shawshank feel. Prison Break is awesome, too, but ultimately I think an escape game is something entirely different from the other two, although both concepts are interesting. My early design ideas aped My Life With Master overly much, but I've been keeping it on the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22336.0" rel="nofollow">back burner</a> as I encounter new games and work on other designs.<br><br>My take emphasizes the tension between the Outside, the things outside the prison that give your character hope and motivation to get out one day, and the Institution, which pressures the character to do what it takes to get along inside. I'm also intrigued by pairing up various attributes in ways that mirror that tension - things like Crime and Guilt, Shiv and Lord (religion), and Snitch and Cell Block. <br><br>My struggle in moving forward with the design is in deciding what the characters should be doing and what to have the system reward - leading gangs, working your way through the ranks, keeping your head down, etc. Of course, there's also the challenge of making something so bleak fun. I think Grey Ranks and others will have a lot to teach me in that department. <br/><br/>James Brown also has a prison game on the backburner as I recall - Do Your Own Time. Hopefully he'll come by to talk about it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105481/#Comment_105481" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T01:59:19+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  1:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was working on an idea called 'contained' that would be specifically about relationships between characters within a confined space.
