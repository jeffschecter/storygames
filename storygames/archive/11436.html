I'm using Mary Renault's <i>The Praise Singer</i> as a template, so the game wouldn't unfold with uber-violent <i>300</i>-style shenanigans.  Some scenarios might involve serving as part of an embassy to neighboring states, conducting espionage or investigations in advance of law proceedings, social climbing and carousing, dealing with problems and intrigues that might arise as part of discharging ones societal duties (such as sponsoring a theatrical production or a warship -- they could get scrappy and cut-throat about such things).  As characters grow in reputation, they'd have to fend off attempts by their rivals to have them ostracized and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the attributes and the simplicity of AGON; the former seems to cover every possiblity (though I'd change all the ability headings to their Greek versions, and under "Craft" I'd switch "Music" to "Perform" to cover a character's poetic or theatrical bent).  But, you're right that it seems more Homeric -- it's-all-about-me! -- than Classical -- it's-all-about-my-family!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm tempted to hack the old Flashing Blades! rules . . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254641/#Comment_254641" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T21:51:14+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  9:51PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like you could hack it to make it work - think about restating monsters as events that need to be dealt with or something like that?<br><br>Certainly the competition for glory and fate mechanics seem like they'd made easily onto the later period, just toning down the supernatural elements of it a bit.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254667/#Comment_254667" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T01:52:52+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  1:52AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike has a point, actually.

Luckily, the Age of Pericles wasn't quite as docile as it would appear at first glance.  Everything from an earthquake that caused untold suffering at Sparta -- and sparked the helot uprising called the Messenian War -- to battles on the Boeotian frontier and the first Peloponnesian War . . . there will be plenty of opportunity for characters to distinguish themselves on the political stage, even in the long shadows cast by Pericles, Cimon, and Ephialtes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like AGON's Glory, Fate, and Divine Favor mechanics.  And I'm with Mike on the functions of Fate and Glory in this setting: it will mean the difference between an obscure funeral and immortality.  Divine favor might be the touch of a god, or it might just be that inexplicable luck those on the upwardly mobile path seem to possess (or to create).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther alterations I'm thinking about include dropping starting character's name die to d4, or d6 if they belong to one of the old aristocratic families; names themselves will follow the Classical model of name + lineage + deme, and perhaps the choice of demes can substitute for heroic traits (this will depend on how much I can glean from the nature of the various demes [regional divisions, townships and villages]).  Right now, I'm going to focus solely on Athens and its territory; indeed, I've taken to calling this mod ATTIKA.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to look into re-skinning monsters . . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254882/#Comment_254882" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T19:15:06+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  7:15PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Once you start a battle, the system doesn't care as much about what you're doing in the fiction.
