Whiteboards are cool for this, but we don't even have one, and sometimes the table is crowded and your health gets rubbed off by accident. I went through a bunch of options, and came up with one that's probably been done before, but I haven't found an example of. I made a doll from cheap fabric and drew my character on it, and then used different coloured pins to record the wounds. (Our system has 3 wound severities: minor, moderate, and serious, so one pin for each.) If the wound damages the limb or gets infected, I tie a black or green ribbon around the limb. When my character takes a hit, I hand the doll and the appropriate pin to the GM, and the GM sticks the pin where it hurts. If it's my own doing, I have to stick the pin in. It's a visual/tactile reminder of how pain hurts. The pins also help me remember where my injuries are so I roleplay them properly.<br/><br/>Here is a photo of a new one that hasn't been drawn on for someone else's character:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://sadpanda.us/images/1495856-LGD51Z5.jpg"/><br/>As you can see, I am not experienced at sewing. I found it really easy to do while watching TV, though, and the materials are very cheap from the local fabric shop. The last one I made, despite being of even poorer construction than the one pictured, survived the previous campaign without much damage. I imagine that as long as you're not using a HP BIGNUMBERS system, it's adaptable to other health/wound/harm systems.<br/><br/>So, yeah. What y'all think? Has anyone done something similar? Was it done better by someone else twenty years ago in something I've never heard of? Do you know of (or have you made) RPGs that use similar tactile game components instead of writing things down? I know of Dread, of course, and imagine that SG knows of many others.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh" title="Chugosh"><img alt="Chugosh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/289/nOED25F16XENN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh">Chugosh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410522/#Comment_410522" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T01:59:21+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  1:59AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a fun idea!<br/>You could take it further, though, and have everyone have their dolls of their characters, all to a scale, and each item of importance represented on the doll.  You might even do away with the character sheet altogether!  You would need at least a six inch doll for all that, though.<br/>I can just imagine the looks at conventions as you hand out the pregens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

it would be cool, but would require effort. We have a system of history-having magic items in our fantasy setting and it could be cool to make them in felt or something. Not that I know how to make anything in felt.<br/><br/>The Voodoo thing is, I think, the response of nearly everyone when they first see it. My sister was like "oh, so you made a voodoo doll." There's some resonance with that in how it works. Pin goes in, your character gets hurt. Because the pins are longer than the doll is thick, I handle the doll of a more hurt character more carefully because I'm concerned about getting pricked.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410596/#Comment_410596" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T13:29:09+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  1:29PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            easier than just make them in felt, make them first in cardboard, stick that on a piece of Felt and then cut it out. Repeat for the other side. The more you decorate the doll, the less it would look like vodoo. It actually makes me think of something we use here in Peru, called <a href="http://spanish.alibaba.com/product-free-img/ekeko-abundance-fortune-good-luck-god-amulet-11-1-2-29-21-cm-height-110782302.html" rel="nofollow">Ekeko</a>. It's sort of a reverse vodoo, where you attach things to the doll to bring good fortune to you. Heh, it may give you an idea of how the doll of a power-gamer may end up looking like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410661/#Comment_410661" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-28T00:28:05+00:00" title="March 28, 2013 12:28AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Ekeko is awesome.
