Instead of being set in a polar never-never land, it's set in Iberia during the fall of the Caliphate of Cordoba (also called the Reconquista or the Crusades.)<br/><br/>So we've just finished our game, John and Tony and Alexis and I. It's the second session. We're all staring at each other, not saying anything, and there's this great big deep sigh that wells up from within all of us. It feels good. It's catharsis.<br/><br/>Tragedy is supposed to provoke catharis through pathos. Catharsis is the audience feeling relieved at the end, pathos is real torn emotion. Thou Art But a Warrior has it in spades. Like, this scene earlier on, where I just set up Sharif (John's guy) and his daughter Aisha and I go "wow, wait, I don't have to antagonize this at all: his plans have failed, he's stuck, he's got no good options." So I just wait, and watch him struggle with lying and betraying his faith or telling the truth and betraying his pride. And John sits there for maybe five minutes, not like "I can't think of anything" but just totally in-character "oh my god I don't know what to do."<br/><br/>See, Polaris doesn't do this on its own. Polaris is about bathos (overblown emotional melodrama). And that's cool, and it's good, but man it isn't as awesome as Thou Art But A Warrior. It's not just a supplement for the game: it's a completion of its promise.<br/><br/>I love it so much.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101463/#Comment_101463" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T20:41:59+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  8:41PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game was amazing.

Because if it's not, the bullshit of the "my progressive knowingness knows all the ignorant secrets of your hidebound heart" meme is rising so thick here and on sister sites it's becoming embarrassing.<br/><br/>Here's where we go next: "You don't want to play D&amp;D because you're embarrassed to play a Paladin who get his powers from a Neutral Good God! PUSSY!"<br/><br/>And here are some crazy thoughts: Maybe a lot of people aren't available for playtests because they haven't heard of the game yet.  Maybe people are busy playing the 247 other games already on their "must play" list.  Maybe some people who's played <i>Polaris</i> found it not their cup of tea, and by inference have decided they've already pre-screened <i>Thou art But a Warrior</i> and have decided to give a pass.<br/><br/>There are a million reasons <i>not</i> to a play a game that have nothing to do with people being "pussies," failing to meet the standards of stretching their imagination enough, or not meeting the standards of "I know this designer and like the designers game so of course I played the game and if you don't want to do what I do with my time you're a fucking moral failure."<br/><br/>Certainly, some  of the more reasonable reasons apply to me.  From what I've read on this thread it sounds great. I'd love to play it. But my group is already books with three other games right now, and I hadn't heard of of it till today.<br/><br/>For god's sake people, get of your god-damned progressive high-horses.  Sometimes you get better perspective standing on the ground with the rest of us mortals.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101535/#Comment_101535" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T11:37:31+00:00" title="October  7, 2007 11:37AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how did the Discord mechanic work for you guys?

I've toyed around with tragedy in games before, with PTA and Wicked, a bit. But the structure of the game and mechanics really brought it all together this time around. Plus, of course, some really wonderful players. I want to do more games in this vein, like Grey Ranks and carry.<br/><br/>The Discord rules worked great for us. They made for a perfect two-session game for four players. With three, you might be able to get three sessions out of it before you hit the end. Maybe. We tweaked the experience rules a bit, which worked out really well. We wrote down the Knight's Code of Conduct from the text, and then for every part of it that we violated we got an experience roll. This was SO MUCH fun.

Joshua needs to chex himself before he wrex himself.<br/><br/>However, I'm kinda confused about the Man of Reason starting ability and the penalty for bringing in "supernational elements besides God's Will."  First, it's not really clear what consitutes God's Will.  Angels?  Divine light?  Hearing God's voice?  Second, it seems like even the most rational medieval Muslims would believe in djinn, since they are mentioned in the Qur'an.  Now, I can imagine them not believing that every sick person is ill because they are afflicted by djinn and prefer modern medicine and such, but I have a hard time imagining medieval Islam as something like Jeffersonian Christianity, without any supernatural elements.  Am I just totally up the wrong tree here?<br/><br/>Also, if the God's Will effects are going to be pretty common, I think the game definitely needs a list of appropriate Islamic religious imagery from the period.  With Christianity, most of us can conjure up stuff about saints and angels and the four winged animals from Revelations and lambs and shepherds and the texts of various hymns and stuff.  I find that much harder to do for Islam and I took a couple courses on the Qur'an in college.  If God's Will is going to manifest on the side of the Muslims, how is it going to look?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lexonus" title="Lexonus"><img alt="Lexonus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lexonus">Lexonus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101750/#Comment_101750" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T20:28:11+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  8:28PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ben any ETA on when Polaris will be restocked at IPR?

There were several things I really liked about the game. The setting is wonderful. I don't have anything against playing games set in the real world, and in this case, it made the game more meaningful for me-- there weren't any flying carpets, just the occasional reminder that we were playing in a time that was real, and that unlike Polaris, where you can sustain this false hope that since it's a magical fantasy world maybe things will turn out okay, here, you really are going to fail. Your character's civilization will fall. That you are sitting around a table today is proof of it. The game gives me a stronger emotional connection to that period of history, much like Steal Away Jordan also does. Since I like history, I'm inclined to like both these games. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe discord really works. It's another thing that contributes to the feeling that you will fail. Near the end of the game, Ben's character kept trying to win the battle inside the city, but he couldn't. He was a military genius, but discord had passed 15, and thus the new restrictions were in place, and we couldn't ask to win the battle. The most we could do was ask to make it to another part of the city intact. The discord also works as a great pacing mechanism. It shortens the game a bit, and it means you don't have a long period where one guy has gone out and the other three are still waiting to cross over. It also meant we had an interesting spread of endings: John's character sunk deeper and deeper into corruption until he finally topped out and converted to Christianity, which made him an NPC. He later was killed as a traitor by Tony's character, who then quickly died in a suicidal attack against the invaders, sacrificing the very last of our forces because he'd rather die than give in to the inevitable. My character was a doctor-knight who had 1 weariness; he lived, but was so appalled with himself that he gave up his sword, renounced his faith, and became a wandering doctor's assistant to his friend. Ben's character ended with one zeal still remaining, so instead of giving up, he spent the rest of his life in north Africa, convinced that he could raise the support to retake the peninsula. I think some formal explanation of what sort of ending you get based on your zeal/weariness would be useful, but even witout it we all ended up with what I felt were appropriate endings for our characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe "Man of Reason" rule also works well for keeping the game grounded while still leaving the option open for supernatural stuff. We never felt the need to do away with it, but it was nice to know I could have if I'd gotten a really cool idea. I didn't see any conflict with the transition scenes, either. Those were supposed to be unmistakable signs of God's will, which isn't covered by "Man of Reason". Also, our transition scenes were all very personal things which each character witnessed by himself. We didn't have any other manifestations of God's Will. It turns out that the setting is so rich on its own that it didn't even occur to me to introduce a four-winged animal.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I thought the game was excellent. I enjoy original Polaris a lot, and I wouldn't want to never play it again, but if I could only play one from here on, it would have to be TABAW. That moment of silence at the end, where we all looked down and almost sighed, is the sort of thing that makes roleplaying worthwhile.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101759/#Comment_101759" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T22:45:20+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 10:45PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's something really moving about playing a game where your character is likely to do things like receive a revelation of diving will, face the choice of conversion or death, and experience being utterly abandoned by their god.

I also don't really buy the premise that people of science don't believe in the supernatural; I think that's a modern anachronism.  But I see what you folks are saying about wanting to focus on the non-supernatural elements and human relationships.  I guess I was just hoping for a more <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>-like mix between banal and religious imagery, but I guess I can talk to my playtest group about something more like that, to see if they'd be interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101890/#Comment_101890" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T08:03:14+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  8:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan: Yeah, it doesn't do well for Dogs in the Vineyard "plausible deniability supernatural" stuff.

This is specifically to avoid gonzo, over-the-top stuff like \xe2\u20ac\u02dcthe angels descend from heaven and decimate the Christian army with flaming swords!\xe2\u20ac\u2122. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not to say that sort of stuff isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t fun, but it prevents people from really engaging with the emotional suffering of the protagonists, as well as detracting from the feeling of fictionalized historical realism.<br/><br/>That being said, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to have a game take place in this setting without addressing religion. So I used it as a tool to heighten the tragedy of the setting.
