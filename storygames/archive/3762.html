The only real hardship is that there is no break between the morning sessions, which makes it a way long morning.  DragonCon does 4 4hr sessions/day starting at 9am and running until 2am with only a dinner break. <br/><br/>Jeff                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian" title="Malthusian"><img alt="Malthusian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian">Malthusian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84817/#Comment_84817" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T15:20:31+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  3:20PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, now that I've stopped and thought about it, I can't believe it's been 12(ish) years since I last went to Dragoncon.

It was good to put a face to the name! You were the only person I saw with a Go Play arrow... including me, and it was my idea!).<br/><br/>I got to try a Dread (Jenga) session Friday night, which went fairly well, though I'd have preferred a more... dreadful game. Just a bit too much humor and distraction and OOC jokes to really get into the "horror" of the situation. I also made the suggestion that, in general in horror, you have the "Do horror movies exist in this game world" talk--we default to "yes" and basically fucked up the whole scenario of exploration and slow reveal of hideous agendas. Instead, it was like Eddie Murphy's joke about why you can't have black folk (sic) in horror movies:\n<blockquote>"Look at this house, dear, lovely, lovely... with the chandelier in the stairwell--"<br/>**demonic whisper** "GET OUT"<br/>"--too bad we can't be staying here." **pivots in mid stride and walks toward stage rear**</blockquote>\nAnd that's just what we did: get the fuck out of Dodge. Doesn't really matter, in Dread--you can get killed trying to jimmy a car door lock--but it DID mean a lot of GM prep was only revealed after play, in exposition. I like to think I was at least somewhat willing to play the dumb horror movie victim: my Olympic fencer and all-around good guy took pains to try to alert authorities even as we were escaping (we had to follow a convoluted plan of my own devising, to set a cabin on fire while others prepped canoes to paddle down-river to safety), and he readily went back to look for "missing" people in our group (dead, all of 'em, but that's what the guy would do). I think I was finally killed by an NPC in our midst--never trusted the guy (smart), but he deserves to get away too, no? (No. At least, not along with us.)<br/><br/>Funny moment was when I dropped the tower on, like, my first pull--I have shaky hands at best, even without tension. I was made a Dead Man Walking because I, a med student, couldn't stop bleeding due to severe lacerations (fair enough to be tested--one pull only). I said something like, "We'll at least I died saving another's life."<br/>GM: "Uh, no, dropping the tower is failure, remember? She's gonna bleed out very soon without hospitalization...." (Note that most horror--including this one--involves improbable levels of isolation of setting!)<br/>Me: "...At least I died prolonging a plot hook's life for a few minutes."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
