You have coins, which are both an in-game resource (you can earn them, lose them, etc, and the character with the most wins at the end of the game - conservation is important).  <br/><br/>In a conflict, the client faces off against the techs, and each secretly bids a number of coins.  The client chooses either heads or tails for their topmost coin, which signals the side that matters - the opposite side is discarded from the tech's coins.  The technicians can bid both heads and tails in any combination, playing it either safe (a mixed, but weak, set) or reckless (all one side).  All this is done without consultation, behind a cupped palm.<br/><br/>The technician players observe the client players chosen face (heads or tails).  They discard their non-face coins and pool the rest.  If they have a cumulative total higher than the client player, they win.  The player putting in the most total coins narrates the outcome.  <br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a copier repair challenge, and the two technicians are working against the client.  <br/><br/>The client secretly bids five coins and turns them all to tails.  <br/><br/>The first tech secretly bids six coins, three heads and three tails.<br/><br/>The second tech secretly bids three coins, all tails.  <br/><br/>There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a reveal, and the first tech tosses out his three heads coins.  What remains are five tails for the client and six tails, total, for the techs.  The techs win the conflict and repair the photocopier.  The first tech, who bid the most total coins (heads and tails together), narrates the outcome.  <br/><br/>So, tell me what I'm missing - is there an obvious strategy in effect?  Are the short term tactical choices of the tech players compelling at all, keeping in mind that each will want to conserve coins as much as possible, but that losing collectively really sucks?<br/><br/>Thanks for any feedback.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94405/#Comment_94405" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T12:48:13+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 12:48PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 12:57PM by Graham.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of questions.

Don't they all want the same outcome, a working copier? I could see maybe the techs wanting to shirk work, so their losing would mean they have to fix the copier.<br/><br/>Anyway, your question was about the mechanics, so...<br/>At first blush it seems okay. Simple and easy to grasp. <br/>But, in the nominal case where each player has 2n coins, do things sort of break down? The client will have 2n heads, say, and the techs each have only to split their bets (n heads, n tails) to tie. So who wins a tie?<br/>Is the coin allocation secret before betting and is it easier for the client to gain coins?<br/><br/>(edit: Sorry to echo the previous post.

Seriously though, perhaps their goal is to bilk the owner for as much cash as possible and still have a satisfied customer.

Winning nets you more.  Coins you bid are lost.  You can gain more in other ways, like exemplifying your character's Need.\n<blockquote>I'm assuming, in the example, that "The client secretly bids five coins and turns them all to tails" could be replaced by "The client bids five coins and turns the topmost coin to tails": is that right?

Essentially, I'm rewarded for acting ineffectively.<br/><br/>So, is there any disadvantage to losing the challenge? That is, do I lose coins if I lose the challenge? If not, then why not bid a single coin every time, thereby minimising my losses? Then, if any other player foolishly bids more than one coin, they win the conflict but I win the game!

You *are* penalized for losing a challenge, above and beyond lost bids.  I'm not sure how but it will be noteworthy and something to avoid.  Maybe you lose only the dominant sided coins in a winning bid and all coins in a losing bid.  This is a little tricky because each character (tech or client) only appears in two scenes.  So you allocate coins to them at the start of the game, but there is not much room for change to their internal economy.  <br/><br/>As for evenly dividing coins - hmm, I'm not sure.  That does seem like an optimum strategy.  Is it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
