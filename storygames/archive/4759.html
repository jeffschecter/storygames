South Korea also has a rich online gaming culture, and the game "Lineage" is a part of that. Because Lineage is about leaders and followers, a game which mirrors it in some ways might be good. I can recommend <a href="http://www.gregstolze.com/reign/index.html" rel="nofollow">Reign</a> for that, and wish I could recommend the Riddle of Steel, but it's poorly written and everything outside combat is less good.<br/><br/>Lastly, I kind of recommend <a href="http://secure1.white-wolf.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=66&amp;products_id=703" rel="nofollow">Pendragon</a>.

For Eastern themes Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a safe bet, especially with men. The themes and events are likely to be a little too difficult for all but the most skilled English speakers to express in that language, however. Emulating MMORPGs is a cool idea, though I think the Lineage system of leaders and followers works because it's such a massively multiplayer environment. In general, a standard quest-based hack-and-slash adventure is a pretty good idea because it's simple and on safe ground. Many Koreans are huge gaming geeks, and system-wise CRPGs are dungeon crawls of some sort at heart: Search map, get treasure, kill things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107312/#Comment_107312" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T20:01:40+00:00" title="November  7, 2007  8:01PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>Cool idea, but in general Koreans are likely to prefer Western fantasy when it comes to fantasy</blockquote>\nSorry I wasn't clear:<br/><br/>I wasn't thinking about FOR Koreans.<br/><br/>/I/ want to play a Korean-themed fantasy game. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107317/#Comment_107317" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T22:11:14+00:00" title="November  7, 2007 10:11PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We sell a fair amount of Panty Explosion and Classroom Deathmatch in South Korea. the games seem to be well recieved there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107389/#Comment_107389" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T09:19:34+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  9:19AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2007 9:20AM by Eldir.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>/I/ want to play a Korean-themed fantasy game. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy</blockquote>\nDoubly cool idea!
