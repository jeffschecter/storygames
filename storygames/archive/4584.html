Nixon</cite>If they have gods with a physical presence in the world, or even an overpowering disparity between abilities of sentient creatures, TSOY won't work for it.</blockquote>\nJust a reference point backing Clinton up - we've tried this and it uniformly fails at the table. Now we don't try it any more.<br/><br/>I'd like to here why and how it didn't work.  I'm curious, not incredulous here.<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time seeing why having essentially unbeatable gods or creatures walking the earth won't work for TSoY.  In games where the gods or creatures are unbeatable they are essentially backdrop or situation, not characters.  Even if they are sentient.  There are lots of other things that are like that even in TSoY.  Things I say to players, "You can do that but you can't succeed."  If a player says, "I pick up that mountain and throw it across the ocean."  I'm like, "Um... not."  Or if I'm got a million man army and the character is by himself he might be able to demoralize the army or slow the army down or lots of things like that but if he states he grabs his sword and attacks it directly then he ain't gonna kill them all.<br/><br/>Gods and big, bad-ass monsters like dragons are like those things to me.  They're there to cause aftermath that characters have to deal with.<br/><br/>Just not sure why TSoY can't do this.<br/><br/>~Andrew                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103719/#Comment_103719" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T12:40:20+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 12:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2007 12:40PM by Clinton.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Andrew,</p>\n<p>This is a super-frustrating discussion for me, mainly because the answer, for me, is, "I wrote a game that explicitly has no gods and no super-destructive unthinking monsters."</p>\n<p>The answer, for others, may be that the mechanics don't support making anything powerful enough that every other character doesn't have a shot at it.

Andrew's comments seem to indicate that Deities or super powerful creatures, sentient or not, wouldn't be treated as characters with actual ratings but as narrative aspects of the world? In this light, it seems to me that a large demi-god standing in front of you saying "you cannot pass" is really no different than an extremely tall and difficult cliff. Or a really wide, and choppy looking river. Interact with the demigod all you want, take a swing at her if you like (or dare). But just as climbing the Cliffs Of Despair might not be a feat attempted by right-thinking mortals (because, hey, you'd fall off for sure), getting past that demigod is an affect of the setting, and not one of an active interaction with another character.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that I think this would in fact work in the game, I'm just noticing this seeming incongruity between your positions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103731/#Comment_103731" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T14:01:58+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  2:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But climbing a cliff in TSOY is a pretty easy affair for a competent character...

To me these are two separate issues: some games' mechanics just can't handle modelling certain things efficiently, and that's cool: one way to get around this problem is "treat dragons as natural features" as I suggest, and whether this is a good thing, or not, is again another topic for discussion. On the other hand, some games can be bent to purposes their designers never really intended and quite successfully bent; in these cases, frankly, I rejoice, because that way lies innovation and fun.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean I don't sympathize Clinton's plight; it's tough to watch people saying "I kind of like your game, but how can I add this element that you originally thought was antithetical". But still, I think in the long run that might turn out to be a good thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103741/#Comment_103741" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T14:40:41+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  2:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think the problem here is the word "model."</p>\n<p>Try thinking in terms of "use."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103742/#Comment_103742" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T14:44:17+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  2:44PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that Sheelba and Ningauble are gods in any functional way.

That's not a snarky apology by the way.  I really didn't mean to start a conversation that would be something difficult for you to participate in.  I guess my response to your reasoning is that I find that the mechanics of TSoY really grab me but I'm not terribly enthusiastic about Near.  I don't dislike Near but I don't get very excited about it either.  So, like some others I've pulled the mechanics out and melded it into things I'm more excited about.  I see your point that it isn't the same game any longer but it is still the same mechanical system.<br/><br/>I guess my reason for asking in the first place was to try to understand <b>why</b> you decided to make the "No gods. No monsters." choice.  If you've already answered that somewhere else, point me in that direction and I'll go read.  Thanks.<br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>Viktor is correct.  I wouldn't stat the 1000 year old dragon.  He'd just be there.  Like I wouldn't stat a hurricane or a volcano, even if those were intelligent objects.  Basically, I'm saying that I like both as a GM and as a player when there are some people, places and things that I can't compete and win against.  They're just there and I (or the players) just have to deal with them.  That's life.

Isn't this an automatic player defeat when the god's interests cross the PC's interests? I've never seen a game where this works well.<br/><br/>What happens when you've got a god who's statted at nigh-unbeatable levels? Nine Worlds can be like this in the early stages of play, and it can work. But does this work in TSOY? If I add a "Divine" ability level above Grand Master, will this work or not? Is this the questions you're after, Gaerik? If so, I'd like to focus in on it a bit more.<br/><br/>This is the exact question I'm struggling with in Principia. My instinct is that high statted gods in TSOY is a mistake, but I want to test it to be sure. Has anybody done this?

That's essentially the gods of the Greeks or Norse.   Even the really powerful mortals tended to tangle with the gods at an oblique angle and not head on.  Head on ends up with squished mortals.  Sure, this can be done wrong (just like anything else).  It can also be done right.<br/><br/>I had thought of a level above Grandmaster but thought it seemed like too much fiddling.  Perhaps it'd be better to simply stat the deity out in the areas where the PC's can compete and oppose it.  For example, while in the ocean I can't really oppose Poseidon's ability to make a tidal wave or some such but as a PC I could outwit him into making that tidal wave go the way I want and then use it to push my ship where I wanted to go faster.  Or I can't really attack Poseidon but when he calls up the kraken to do battle, I can kill his minion.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103755/#Comment_103755" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T16:30:46+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  4:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew,<br/><br/>If I tried to explain why I decided to make a game about human action, I wouldn't do it justice. I don't have to defend why my game is about people instead of other things, and I think it's a really, really good thing that it can't be every game. Let me be clear: it sounds to me like you like TSOY because others like it or because you want to like it, but it is not right for the type of game you want to play - and that is a super-good thing.<br/><br/>Ok, last time explaining things from a mechanical angle: The lowest ability rating and highest ability rating are engineered specifically so that the highest can't beat the lowest automatically. That, plus the fact that the GM can't call for Bringing Down the Pain, plus the fact that unresisted rolls (that is, against nature, or non-human things) are won very easily, means that the only opposition one can bring against characters in TSOY is merely difficult, not impossible, to defeat. Your idea of something the GM could make up that characters can't overcome however the players like is literally impossible by the rules.<br/><br/>All your talk about Greek gods is the complete and utter antithesis of what the game is about. It is, despite its heroics and fantasy stuff, an extremely realist game that denies the existence of superhuman forces, and instead focuses on what people believe and what they do in the name of that belief. If you want to play something with super-human stuff, TSOY ain't right for you. Don't shoehorn it out of good will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103757/#Comment_103757" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T16:50:12+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  4:50PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton,<br/><br/>That's all cool.

Yes, it is tempting to shoehorn mechanics we like into things they weren't meant for.  Sometimes, you come up with a hack that works, but most of the time it crashes and burns.  <br><br>It is particularly tempting to try these things when you first start out with a new system and are exicted about it but don't understand the subtleties.  I also think of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> and numerous ill-fated attempts to port the conflict-resolution mechanic to other environments by well-meaning gamers who don't realize that the town creation system is the central mechanic from which all else hangs.<br/><br/>"You can beat anything" really is at the core of TSoY.  It lives in every fiber of the rules.<br/><br/>The first TSoY game I ever played was a world that had "gods".  Our characters had been brought up to worship them.  We feared and admired them.  Then we found out some unpleasant things about some of them.   Then we actually met two of them...and handed their asses to them.  They weren't so powerful after all.  It rocked.<br/><br/>I played Brother Vedis, a devout monk who was the last of his order and wanted nothing other than to protect the precious holy artifact his order had guarded for centuries.  By the end of the game, he had lost everything he came in with, especially his faith.  All he had left was newfound faith in himself and the people around him.  As it happened, he transcended during one of the last conflicts of the game (ironically using the prayer skill) and the final moment for him was for me to describe him as an elderly man in the future telling the story of what happened in the game to a subsequent generation of children.  One child asks "So, what does it all mean?"  He replies "It doesn't mean anything.  It is just what happened."<br/><br/>It was one of the most satisfying conclusions for a character story I have ever had in a role playing game, and it only happened because TSoY is precisely the game that it is.<br/><br/>I know there have been TSoY appreciation threads lately, and maybe this really belongs there, but I think in the context of this discussion, it bears demonstrating that limitations built into games like TSoY, Dogs, and Capes are not just inconveniences.  They are also a primary source of the beauty that can come out of playing them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103834/#Comment_103834" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T09:24:37+00:00" title="October 19, 2007  9:24AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread demands a TSoY-based game with a world where gods walk the earth.
