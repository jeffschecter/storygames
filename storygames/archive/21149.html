As this is one of the best LotFP modules, you may wish the consider the following to be SPOILERS - this one's well worth playing if you are into this sort of thing at all.<br/><br/>So here's what the tactical situation looks like from a bird's eye perspective:<br/><br/><i>The mission target is the relief and rescue of a couple hundred hostages, plus finding a way out of a hostile fae magic pocket dimension for the party and the hostages. The hostages are held in a village on an island, with a big ivory wizard tower in the middle. The hostiles consist of a few dozen demonic teddy bears (clearly subhuman in combat abilities), five wardog-like poodles (sort of dangerous) and a dozen or so flying, archerous cupids (subhuman, but flying and shooting). The hostages seem ill-treated and mentally defeated, under constant surveillance, but basically free to move about in the village. There's a 5th level magic-user in the tower, plus all the mission-critical mcguffin stuff is in there, too. There's a single entrance to the tower, plus a balcony 30 feet high from the ground.</i><br/><br/>And here's what our party decided to do about it:<br/><br/><i>The adventuring party of seven people goes up to the single bridge leading to the island-village and requests an audience with whoever is running the place. The two teddy bears guarding the bridge request them to leave their weapons, which they decide to do, and follow them into the village. The magic-user appears at the top balcony of the tower and addresses the newcomers, welcoming them warmly into this (nefarious, horrifying) place as new residents, but refusing to come down to meet them in person for now. The party decides to attack the tower unarmed in an attempt to reach the magic-user; their plan involves breaching the doors and taking control of a hypothetical internal stairway. A sudden skirmish erupts as the adventures start breaking in, with the enemy forces converging on the adventurers as they fight their way into the tower; the party forgets to secure the stairway as they'd planned, and gets bogged down individually, each adventurer fighting several halfling-sized teddy bears; the party is wiped out, one by one.</i><br/><br/>The specific concept that motivated the party to attempt to breach the tower was that they had concluded that the magic-user in the tower was the demonic linchpin of the entire pocket dimension; if they could exorcise the devil, they could save everybody in one swoop. As it happened, the assault on the tower proved that their basic concept was faulty: the magic-user was not, in fact, vulnerable to Turn Undead, upon which the entire plan rested. The last member of the party to go down was the priest, after they realized their error.<br/><br/>The peculiar bit in our newest TPK was that once the party was established in the middle of the fae/demon village, with the magic-user unwilling to come down from their tower, the players actually had a long-ish strategic discourse wherein they fielded a number of ideas that would seem in hindsight to provide them with more of a chance for success. For instance, the following concepts were brought up:<br/><b>*</b> The party could wait for night and try to climb up to the tower balcony stealthily.<br/><b>*</b> The party could live in the village for a while to observe and learn more about the particulars of the place. They could perhaps foment a rebellion among the prisoners, create some weapons, and so on.<br/><b>*</b> The party could continue interacting with the magic-user, perhaps over the course of a longer time period, to gain their trust and attempt an assassination when their guard is lowered; the magic-user doesn't seem very smart, after all.<br/><b>*</b> The party could distract the frankly quite stupid teddy bears and whatnot, attract them away from the tower, and <i>then</i> attack the tower with a momentary tactical advantage when the majority of the village's overseers were not in the immediate vicinity.<br/><br/>So afterwards I'm left to ponder - what went wrong here, exactly? The party starts with at least three viable strategic approaches (stealth, diplomacy and brute force), they pick one (diplomacy, wherein they declare their presence and disarm themselves), but then decide to follow up with an ill-planned impromptu assault on the enemy in the exactly most disadvantageous time and place. All this, in a context where the players spend lengthy amounts of time discussing their options; they even voted on the immediate assault, which vote went 5-1 in favour I think.<br/><br/>This sort of thing is not unique at all - and if you have your own stories of herd stupidity, feel free to share. After thinking about it a bit, the way I'd formulate my thinking is that it's actually pretty difficult to produce smart decision-making in the iterative committee context that D&amp;D offers: there's a complex strategic situation, and there's lots of chefs in the kitchen, all with their own unique ideas and preferences, and the situation is changing all the time, and you need to separate the meaningful tactical and strategic facts from a compex game world narrative. There's some effort at chairmanning the proceedings, but it's not super disciplined by any means. This is an environment in which herd stupidity has a great chance to flourish, causing specific cognitive faults in the proceedings:<br/><b>*</b> The party may come to lack strategic foresight: they make decisions moment-to-moment without considering their long-term goals.<br/><b>*</b> The party may come to lack strategic memory: they outright forget what they were supposed to be doing, and thus waste their positioning as they jump tracks.<br/><b>*</b> The party may get stuck on a singular strategic conceit to the exclusion of all else.<br/><b>*</b> The party may outright miss important strategic particulars; not because characters fail some checks, but simply because the players do not think to ask obvious questions, or ignore pertinent details as they are narrated.<br/><br/>Lots of things happen in old-fashioned exploratory wargamey D&amp;D, as it's a quite varied game, but alongside tactical combat scenarios and daring guessing games this is one of the classics: a complex strategic situation where the players have great initial freedom of approach, but every move they make rapidly narrows down their choice set (solidifies the situation towards a resolution, in other words). While making smart strategic choices is an excellent skill to have here, I think that simply having <i>some</i> handle on the group debate dynamics would be even better: first train yourselves to act and decide things intelligently as a group, so as to avoid herd stupidity, and then perhaps there will be some room for actual strategic brilliance. But the first thing, before anything else, needs to be to get a handle so that you're not collectively <i>dumber</i> than you are individually.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463569/#Comment_463569" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-27T08:23:48+00:00" title="May 27, 2017  8:23AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few questions...<br/><br/>Did this situation involve an "established" party, in that the same mix of real-life and fictional people had a track of <i>successfully</i> going on adventures together?

Of the six players present three are core or former core regulars, two are casual regulars and one was indeed a first-time participant. I cannot really call five of the six players inexperienced, although the game is of course very deep and complex, and most do still have well under 50 sessions of play under their belts - I'm sure this would've looked different if we had more than one 100-session man in there.<br/><br/>The characters were relatively fresh; about half first rolled for this adventure, the rest having been in play for a few sessions, but not through any major adventures yet.<br/><br/>The party dynamics were pretty normal for the group: the most experienced/skilled player in the group shied from seizing leadership, preferring to let others gain experience, as has been usual for him in this campaign; the second-most experienced leader has been out of the game for a month due to life concerns (plus a grieving period for his 3rd level character who died in the spring, perhaps) and thus wasn't in position to do it either. The leadership defaulted to the third core regular, eager rpg newcomer (no prior rpg experience before this campaign) who often leads the party. Pretty much everything was routine except the participation of the new player (no trouble at all, I thought), and one player uncommonly getting drunk (celebrating a passed exam, plus being generally a bore).<br/><br/>The party tends to appoint an explicit leader, but it depends on the leader how they'll go about their leadership - there's no entrenched methodology, and the leadership generally mostly means being the spokesman towards the GM, not necessarily taking, holding and wielding internal authority. I'd personally characterize the leadership traditions as pretty casual, with the understanding that most D&amp;D adventuring crews seem to be quite casually organized. (I veer towards more structure myself when being a player, in an effort to focus and sharpen the attentions of my fellow players.)<br/><br/>I'll observe that the one player who was most active about bringing up alternative courses of action, and who voted against immediate assault when the party was in the throes of herd stupidity, was the experienced old-timer. I believe that the outcome of the adventure would have been quite different had he been in charge, pretty much because he seems to have a better handle on the strategic discourse skills I discussed above; he often recognizes the pattern of events that the party is <i>actually</i> experiencing while it is happening, rather than just focusing on some single detail to the exclusion of everything else. The player in question has been intentionally back-benching himself in this campaign in an effort to let others play more, which means that he usually only leads the adventurers when the fictional situation suggests that he do, or nobody else i up for the task.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463581/#Comment_463581" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-27T17:02:11+00:00" title="May 27, 2017  5:02PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a problem intrinsic to the type of game you're playing. LotFP is, like D&amp;D set up as a wargame, and rewards good wargame thinking and punishes poor tactical choices, like making a frontal assault on the tower. From that perspective, what happened in this game was perfectly predictable and gave the results you should have expected. The session should be considered a resounding success by all players because of that.<br/><br/>But it sounds like that's not the perspective you're taking. You wanted the story to continue, to result in something other than TPK (which often happens simply because there's no rules about surrendering or running away). <br/><br/>My suggestion? Either accept that sometimes these things happen, invent rules which support surrendering, or switch to game from a different RPG subgenre. Even then, poor tactical choices will likely still occur from time to time. It's just usually easier to escape fights in games with more narrative-based combat systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463584/#Comment_463584" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-27T20:02:36+00:00" title="May 27, 2017  8:02PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did not intend to describe a "problem" - it was just a story, coupled with a philosophical observation about the kinds of skills you need to prosper in this game.<br/><br/>And yes, the session was entirely successful as an executed process. I hope I did not imply otherwise. My intent was to philosophize about the skills and approach required for adventurer success in old school D&amp;D. This issue is largely lateral to whether the game is being played correctly and well; you can be playing well and having fun, yet nevertheless lose all the time. I think we play pretty well as far as executing the play process goes; it's just the strategic and tactical decision-making that gets to be somewhat uneven now and then.<br/><br/>If I am disappointed in the occasional (or let's say, regular) failures of our adventuring crew, it's mostly because I'd like them to have more success in their lives to brighten up the grim, grim slog that low-level play, objectively refereed, can be. The way the game goes, though, it can't really happen without the players leveling up their play and reducing the frequency of these kinds of sessions. Even reasonably correct choices often result in defeat in the game, so adventurers can ill-afford worsening the situation with their own choices.<br/><br/>Regarding the more general issue of retreat as a tactical option in D&amp;D, I have to say that most of the time it's the crew's tactics that cause total wipeouts. This time, for instance, they decided to assault an enclosed building in the middle of an enemy encampment; there's not much of a retreat in that choice, it's going to be to the knife. The last time they got wiped out it was because the party got separated while pursuing hostiles (straight into an ambush), and managed to arrive to the field of battle in drips and draps; nevertheless, each individual fraction decided to charge into the on-going melee in a mild instance of gambler's fallacy (mild because I guess the fight was sort of winnable with a bit more luck). That time the only thing preventing them from cutting their losses was a stubborn wish to turn a defeat into a triumph.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463589/#Comment_463589" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-28T08:00:13+00:00" title="May 28, 2017  8:00AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2017 8:01AM by Rafu.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The characters were relatively fresh; about half first rolled for this adventure, the rest having been in play for a few sessions, but not through any major adventures yet.</p></div></blockquote>\nI wonder whether this was a factor which lowered their investment in their characters' success.<br/>I also wonder whether the whimsical theme of the scenario, with the teddy bears etc., may have lead them to underestimate the opposition.<br/><br/>In other words, I'm wondering whether they underperformed tactically because they failed to do better or because they <i>couldn't be bothered</i> to try their best.<br/><br/>"Can't be bothered to try harder" was often a factor of tension in all my attempts at tactical, stakes-are-survival games (various iterations of D&amp;D).

It doesn't even need to be because players are ambiguous about the creative agenda; players can be "underperforming" for all sorts of reasons, such as exhaustion, despair or nihilism. It is particularly common for players to underperform when they are convinced that their efforts cannot have much impact in the results at this point in time: in those situations it's simply psychologically easier to just hurry up, open all the doors, reveal the horrible secrets and get it over with, whatever it is. With players who are on board with the agenda this sort of thing isn't even defeatist, it's just a player's conviction that they've done all they can, and the rest is up to luck, so let's stop fuzzing and start rolling the dice, and if luck is bad then let's make new characters and adventure some more.<br/><br/>In this case, though, I don't think that the players were extremely unmotivated. The casuals were along for the ride as usual, the new guy was listening and learning, but the rest were let's say 80% keen (where 50% would be the campaign average). The factor that particularly motivated the players here was that the adventure was offering substantial rewards for success, and the party is pretty success-hungry after a long string of defeats and pointless adventures with little reward. The adventure was also deeply entangled in sandbox issues (the fate of a town that's been on board since the start), which probably made it more interesting than some, and it was much, much more eldritch than has been usual in the campaign.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if I <i>had</i> to guess at internal psychological reasons, then my bet would be that impatience influenced the player decision to assault immediately here; they may have wanted to have it over with in one session. I consider this normal, players are always being impatient and thus they favour quick and simple fixes. Another factor that they might have thought about is that they were so creeped by the milieu that they feared that their situation would worsen even further if they waited. Neither of these factors were explicitly discussed at the table, though.<br/><br/>I take it, then, that this herd stupidity phenomenon is not familiar to you guys as something that simply happens due to a group of players managing to externalize their thought processes to the group in a way where at the end nobody is actually thinking (or if they are, the majority ignores them), and this then results in decision-making that seems clearly sub-par to an outside observer? That would be interesting, as for me this is something that surfaces pretty regularly. I've been party to similar sequences myself on the player side, and it doesn't really seem to take much for an adventuring party to fail to process their situation into a high-quality battle plan. Just have a key player visit the bathroom while a crucial decision is being made, or misemphasize one hint, and bam, the party may get stuck in an extremely counter-productive strategic stance, upon which it doubles down every chance it gets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463591/#Comment_463591" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-28T12:18:41+00:00" title="May 28, 2017 12:18PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I take it, then, that this herd stupidity phenomenon is not familiar to you guys as something that simply happens due to a group of players managing to externalize their thought processes to the group in a way where at the end nobody is actually thinking (or if they are, the majority ignores them)</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is familiar to me as an out-of-game issue, like when a group of friends are trying to decide whether to order take-away pizza or go out for burgers, whether to play a game or watch a film after dinner, and which one.

In this post you relentlessly refer to "the party" but don't talk about your friends at the table; you casually mention this came after " a long string of defeats and pointless adventures with little reward", which sounds very demoralizing and the opposite of fun, and use the insulting phrase "herd stupidity" to refer to behavior that might just be a cry for help or an utter lack of concern for the outcome. If a GM offers me a long string of defeats and pointless adventures with little reward, I might still go through the motions for the sake of social cohesion, but I am not going to care what happens any more.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463595/#Comment_463595" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-28T16:43:25+00:00" title="May 28, 2017  4:43PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess that's possible, but it does require assuming that I either mischaracterize or misunderstand my own situation. The way I would describe the group is that we're at most mildly frustrated with defeat; enough to make the group eager for success, and actually skeptical of vague adventure hooks, but nowhere near enough to make the players throw the game. Besides, we talk about alternatives to D&amp;D regularly, so it's not like we're stuck playing this game if we don't want to.<br/><br/>The reason for why I don't talk about my friends at the table is precisely that they are my friends at the table - I don't want to discuss how this guy's depression medication is impacting his hobby participation, or how that one's girlfriend would prefer a less lethal game, or how we all treat the 11-year old nephew a bit more gingerly, or how this one guy was particularly useless due to being drunk today, or whatever. I don't feel that I need a public deconstruction of the group to discuss an emergent phenomenon of play that I've encountered time and again in D&amp;D, with different groups; I simply do not believe that the herd stupidity thing is so much because of the specific people, as it is because of the nature of the challenge.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-stupidity-of-the-crowd/278188/" rel="nofollow">Here's an interesting article about herd stupidity</a> in a non-gaming context, perhaps it clarifies the concept a bit. It's a relatively well-established idea in the social sciences that people are not always smarter as a group than they are individually.<br/><br/>I think it's really interesting that you don't have experience with this thing in D&amp;D. I mean, your D&amp;D crews always play smartly in strategic terms, and they only fail because of bad luck or individual foolishness, and not because they fall into a herd mentality and just go with the flow? I find that really unexpected, because I'm seeing this stuff all the time. So much so that it's one of the defining characteristics of clever, high-quality strategic play for me when a group manages to avoid it and respond intelligently to complex strategic problems.<br/><br/>Let's look at another example of herd stupidity from an earlier adventure, with a different group, just to have a broader view:<br/><br/><b>The Block Party</b><br/><br/>A few years ago we were playing "Blocks of Quox" (a fine puzzle adventure published in Fight On!), an adventure with large, tunnel-filling, 10 feet to the side stone blocks that were moved around the dungeon with the aid of magic. I was GMing for a group of four or so adventurers.<br/><br/>Two adventurers crossed a pit in the floor into a tunnel which was blocked by just such a magical cube, which they could perhaps push to have something useful happen in the dungeon. Unknown to them, beyond the cube was a room with bugbears in it. When the adventurers started pushing the stone cube, the bugbears soon reacted and started pushing back, so that the cube started moving inexorably backwards. The speed wasn't anything special and there was like twenty feet of room between the block and the pit, so it wasn't a crisis situation or anything like that.<br/><br/>The way the party reacted to this situation was quite memorable, as they realized that it would be pretty bad to fall into the pit at the mouth of the tunnel, and therefore something needed to be done. The two adventurers chose to continue trying to force the cube back by sheer strength, and, to my amazement, the rest of the party hastened to help them, crossing the pit specifically so as to stop this run-away stone block. They got the entire team there to push back on that block.<br/><br/>After a few strength checks it seemed like the block wasn't going to stop moving (those bugbears are pretty tough!), and the party realized that they'd need to figure out something else. Specifically, they didn't want to fall into that pit. It would be so bad to fall into the pit.<br/><br/>This being a funny TPK story, of course two party members fall into the pit as they're crossing back to the safe side. They drag down the rope the characters had been using to help them cross, leaving the others to try jumping. One of the other characters went voluntarily into the pit, I think, so as to help the fallen ones out before the cube would inexorably fall on their heads. The jumpers were pressed for running space by the approaching cube, and thus failed to reach the other side, falling into the pit with the rest.<br/><br/>At the end we were amazed to realize that yes, the players had managed to get the entire party killed by the combination of bad luck and a slowly moving stone block that fell on them in a pit, all because they had gotten so stuck on the idea of stopping the block that the entire party hurried to join in the effort, despite having a clear picture of the architectural situation. In hindsight nobody could explain why the party could not have just taken their time to help the two initial block-pushers cross the pit, and then let the block fall into the empty pit, thus clearing the way to whatever was behind the block (the next room with bugbears, as it happened). The party had nothing riding on that block, so why was it so important to stop it from moving in the first place? Obvious in hindsight, but somehow the real-time-ish decision-making, the 1st person perspective and the group decision-making process combined into one of the lamest TPKs ever.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463596/#Comment_463596" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-28T18:10:15+00:00" title="May 28, 2017  6:10PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2017 6:10PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>it's actually pretty difficult to produce smart decision-making in the iterative committee context that D&amp;D offers: there's a complex strategic situation, and there's lots of chefs in the kitchen, all with their own unique ideas and preferences, and the situation is changing all the time, and you need to separate the meaningful tactical and strategic facts from a complex game world narrative. <br/>. . . <br/>While making smart strategic choices is an excellent skill to have here, I think that simply having <i>some</i> handle on the group debate dynamics would be even better: first train yourselves to act and decide things intelligently as a group, so as to avoid herd stupidity, and then perhaps there will be some room for actual strategic brilliance. But the first thing, before anything else, needs to be to get a handle so that you're not collectively <i>dumber</i> than you are individually.</p></div></blockquote>Agreed.  I made some efforts toward breaking this down for Delve.  What I came up with amounted to something like:<br/><br/>1) Briefly summarize current options.<br/>2) Which ones don't require more info?  Evaluate those.  If everyone's enthused about one, do that.<br/>3) Which ones do require more info?  Which of those do we know how to pursue?  Of those, is everyone enthused about the required pursuit?  If so, do that.<br/>4) Is everyone willing to throw any more time and energy at the options we don't even know how to pursue?  Really?  You're all on board?  Okay, let's start with the first useful step.<br/><br/>Once you gather more info for (3), then you go back to the list again.<br/><br/>I think the key here, as far as explaining what happened in your game, Eero, is that "enthused" is the key criteria.  I think player enthusiasm is what governs what actually happens, and I think "seems likely to succeed" is only one of many factors that feed into it.<br/><br/>A desperate quick-strike to Turn the linchpin of a pocket dimension sounds <i>fun</i>.<br/><br/>I also think committee deliberations are less fun than action, so the urge to do the first fun-sounding thing that comes up is understandable.  Even if your game didn't actually experience the failings that Jason mentioned, the players' suboptimal approach might be a device for avoiding those failings.<br/><br/>A few more specific notes:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><b>*</b> The party may come to lack strategic foresight: they make decisions moment-to-moment without considering their long-term goals.</p></div></blockquote>This sounds potentially like acting from a bad place.

My GM principle for this is Assume The Characters Aren't Morons.  As we all speak to communicate fiction, info will inevitably get lost.  Never allow that to mean the characters have blinders on.

For example, here they got fixated on the idea that if only they could reach and deal with the magic-user in the tower, they could fix it all. (Which was not, note, even remotely true: the magic-user isn't the issue in the scenario, and killing it is no complete fix in itself. In terms of strategic decision-making they were operating on a false premise with insufficient proof for it.)<br/><br/>More generally, your observations are interesting in that it seems you do quite a bit of chairmanning of party discourse as the GM. I do a huge amount myself when I'm being one of the players, but I really, really don't want to get mixed up in that when GMing, as there's no clear boundary at all in between chairmanning the adventuring committee and playing the game for the players: what remains of the game if the GM does the work of analyzing the situation, recognizing the options and predicting their consequences? When GMing, I tend to only interfere in the party proceedings to bring outside pressure (time limits, NPCs who you might not wish to hear your bickering), and to occasionally remind the players on an OOC level about good gamesmanship.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think the key here, as far as explaining what happened in your game, Eero, is that "enthused" is the key criteria.

Speaking philosophically, though, I've found that what you get enthusiastic about is, in turn, a matter of skill and experience: if you have a clear understanding of the strategic cascade in something like e.g. socially hacking a fairy society, then you'll be more enthusiastic to do it; if you don't really even realize that doing something like that would be an option, then you're much more likely to be enthusiastic about the hack'n slash approach.<br/><br/>Another common D&amp;D example: only players who are familiar with the principles of siege warfare ever suggest and enact a siege plan when their characters need to take down a keep or other fortified position. The less informed players keep seeing nails everywhere, because the only thing they have is the hammer (the "I attack them head on" strategy).<br/><br/>And that's where we come back to the skill of actually governing the strategic discourse: if players were more skilled about explaining to each other what their options are, and in what way those options are entertaining and effective and otherwise worthwhile, then the group would be less unlikely to vote on essentially superficial basis. It's the same thing we get in political democracy: the only good decision-making body is an informed one, and therefore the quality of the decision-making is directly dependent on the officials who prep the decision-makers. For D&amp;D, that's individual players prepping each other to make smart decisions; you cannot get a group to make a decision that's smarter than the smartest individual decision would be unless you spend effort in sharing knowledge and wisdom among the group. The potential is admittedly there for two heads to think better than one, but it won't work without specific techniques of committee management.<br/><br/>Note the key element of the story in my original post: the group <i>knew</i>, collectively, that there were other possible approaches. This was not a case of players not knowing that you could play differently, or them innocently missing an opportunity; they managed to have an actual debate on their options, and to pick the seemingly worst plan in the bunch with overwhelming majority support. Is it any wonder if I think that there's something specifically wrong in the decision-making process?<br/><br/>Thinking of our group in particular, the core issue seems to be precisely in the briefing process; the adventuring party probably has too much democracy and too little decision-making structure for practical purposes, in other words - the group is letting players participate in decision-making without having the expertise to make those decisions, and they don't help individuals to get up to speed, and this results in bad choices. If they had a dictator who decided what to do, I doubt that they would have first given away all of their weapons only to decide to follow-up with a frontal assault; the dictator would have stuck to a single strategy throughout. And if they had actually briefed each other - explained why attacking now is a bad idea, and why e.g. sneaking into the tower at night might be better - then it seems unlikely that they would have still stuck with the frontal assault over the other options.<br/><br/>Given that the party seems to run on a pretty democratic basis, the players would probably find advantage in assigning more explicit briefing responsibilities. The way it worked in this particular case was that the players asked each other for options, and thus amassed their list of potential courses to take, which they then voted on to discover an acceptable concensus. However, no serious exploration of the alternatives was engaged in, and nobody really argued for particular solutions over others. The one player in the group who had serious misgivings about the frontal assault was particularly notable in that while he made concrete suggestions for alternatives, he never went as far as to take a firm stance and explain to the others why he preferred a more circuitous strategy. I imagine he was following his general approach of letting the other players gain leadership experience by not interfering too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463599/#Comment_463599" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-28T20:45:05+00:00" title="May 28, 2017  8:45PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>More generally, your observations are interesting in that it seems you do quite a bit of chairmanning of party discourse as the GM.

Because I'm the one person at the table not participating in the strategic decisions, I have the easiest time spotting bad process.  It seems only decent to call it out when I see it.  <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>I agree that it's very important not to do "the work of analyzing the situation, recognizing the options and predicting their consequences".  At the same time, I think it's important to distinguish between the <i>skilled</i> work of this sort, and the sort that anyone could easily do if they were actually there in the fiction instead of sitting at a table.  Although I never help with the former (which work is meaningful to the players), I am always ready to assist with the latter (which isn't).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463600/#Comment_463600" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-28T21:00:49+00:00" title="May 28, 2017  9:00PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2017 9:02PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I've found that what you get enthusiastic about is, in turn, a matter of skill and experience: if you have a clear understanding of the strategic cascade in something like e.g. socially hacking a fairy society, then you'll be more enthusiastic to do it; if you don't really even realize that doing something like that would be an option, then you're much more likely to be enthusiastic about the hack'n slash approach.</p></div></blockquote>I think that's one of the primary factors, but I think "what would be cool and remind me of stories I like and would make me feel like a badass genius if I pulled it off" is a competing one.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>they managed to have an actual debate on their options, and to pick the seemingly worst plan in the bunch with overwhelming majority support.

Maybe that's because, when I GM, I inform the players of everything their characters would know based on living in this fictional world their whole lives?

I usually call this "compensating for the deficiencies in the simulation" or something similar. I may repeat myself, emphasize certain facts, ask questions to make sure the players understand what I am telling them.<br/><br/>Usually that sort of thing is more relevant in spatial issues (who is where, how many doors, which way does the corridor turn) and for socio-cultural assumptions (what your character would already know about this thing, what cultural detail is this NPC signifying), though. I don't remember ever having interfered in adventuring party decision-making procedures in the interest of compensating for the deficiencies of tabletop roleplaying. To the contrary, in fact - I may ask the players to limit their speculative pondering because a character is being pressed for time, or because they are not really in position to have a complex committee meeting with their allies about their next move. Rarely has a character been in a <i>better</i> position to do strategic decision-making than the player is.<br/><br/>Well, no, thinking about it, there is a scenario: when characters make plans over an extended downtime on a highly technical issue, with consulting NPCs to aid them, that's a situation where I put reservations aside and help the players come up with the best plans reasonably possible in a given situation. I have consulted parties extensively on matters such as siege warfare or winter travel under such pretenses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463602/#Comment_463602" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-28T21:08:54+00:00" title="May 28, 2017  9:08PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2017 9:10PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cross-posted!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"compensating for the deficiencies in the simulation"</p></div></blockquote>Yeah!

To be clear, I don't question the reality of herd stupidity as a socio-cognitive phenomenon. It's just that I can easily recollect superficially similar situations my analysis of which was - and still is - different.<br/><br/>Your second example, the slowly moving cube, is actually spot-on in that it immediately registers as an instance of "stupidity" to me, too. What's surprising to me is that you seem to basically count that as an instance of <i>successful</i> (if not victorious) play, at the most basic level. If I try and imagine my D&amp;D3 table of old encountering a TPK in similar circumstances - not too much of a stretch, really - I also imagine the follow-up discussion, blame-shifting and grieving for the dead characters would have made that the very last session for both that "campaign" and that group - next time I or somebody else would have tried to assemble everybody and roll up new characters, next to everyone in the group would have made up excuses not to show up and we'd effectively have reached a silent agreement to let the corpse of the game lie dead. We were terrible losers, apparently.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I won't try and claim I have a lot of experience playing D&amp;D as a game of smart strategic thinking - I don't! Virtually all my experiences playing D&amp;D or very similar games have been plagued by CA clashes, expectation mismatches, flawed social dynamics or at least teenage naivet\xe9 (the only exception perhaps being a short-lived D&amp;D4 game played with serious hardcore Forge theory enthusiasts).<br/><br/>That's possibly why your story of a rushed, badly planned assault which ended in a TPK immediately registered as a CA clash to me... In my games of D&amp;D and the like, I've seen more rushed, badly planned assault than anything else, and they were always predicated on <i>boredom</i> - players who didn't at all <i>enjoy</i> planning who decided to just push their luck and see what would happen, because such a gamble no matter how desperate at least felt like <i>playing</i> to them, while carefully planning their actions was just unbearably boring work.<br/><br/>In another thread, I have recently mentioned a "revival" game of BECMI D&amp;D played at a convention not many years ago. I wrote:\n<blockquote>I was one of three people total (DM included) who were entertained, amongst a bunch of players who were bored to hell - both touchy-feely people and swashbuckling-adventure people allied in lamenting the game's emphasis on avoidance (one's bottom line was: "The only game where, when a hint of story seems to be coming at you, you turn and run". I'm still LOLling to that).</blockquote>\nTo elaborate on that: one player - who I know to be a board-game enthusiast and a strategy/tactics oriented, one who plays to win - had the personality and, let's say, charisma to hog some spotlight. Being also knowledgeable enough about the game, he effectively acted as party leader from minute one. He stocked up on 10ft poles and all that stuff, and I was totally on-board with that.<br/>In the first dungeon room we entered - definitely not a large one, but with at least three doors leading different ways - we started, he and I, to question the GM about the way doors swung, and then devise ways we could "safely" open the doors... It was my opinion, IIRC, that tying a rope to the ring-shaped door-handle would allow us to open the door from a distance, thus keeping us safer. Thus it took us a while, in real time, to choose which door to first open, and how.<br/>Another player (out of 5-6, IIRC) was playing a halfling and had rolled the highest HP total, plus enough starting wealth to buy metal armor and immediately get a nickname in the lines of "the walking can" or something. It was this player, for the records, who later summarized the game with that hilarious catchphrase above. Already he was hitching for action, not being quite on-board with our careful planning how to open doors, and already his character had distinguished himself during our overland approach to the dungeon, by removing his armor to scout ahead, hidden by tall grass (the rules in use giving halflings a flat 9/10 chance to hide outdoors), and successfully detecting a party of kobolds, which we then managed to avoid completely. An excellent result, in my book.<br/>So, when we agreed on how exactly to open that first door, and the room appeared empty and quiet from the outside, of course the halfling was our party member of choice to send in as a vanguard. Some kind of monstrous jelly or ooze started oozing down onto him from the ceiling! Luckily, he passed his save or whatever, remaining unharmed for the first fraction of a minute or so. We urged him to retreat back to the safety of our large armed party, which he did, then we shut the door and tied it with rope for good measure.<br/>Astonishingly, we had no losses so far - not even a single hit point - plus the tied-up door stood unassailed (the monster on the other side appeared to have lost interest in pursuit). Party-leader guy and I were enthusiastic how well things were going for us (we wouldn't have dreamed our point-halfling to survive that ooze-jelly assault) and high-fived each other on a job well-done. Then turned our attention to the remaining doors. Everybody else looked at us weird, and someone pointed out we'd been playing for, like, two hours (including char-gen of course) and we'd accomplished nothing yet. "We'll get to the loot", I think I said, "and we need to get there alive, anyway. And have a clear retreat route secured by then."<br/>Listening carefully at the other two doors, we heard sounds through one of them we decided were the voices and steps of distant kobolds, coming our way to investigate the noises we'd made in the ooze incident. Realizing we'd lost the element of surprise, we broke a 10ft pole into two long pieces of wood we then used to bar the door and quickly proceeded to nail it shut. The noise of course alerted the kobolds, who hastened toward us, but couldn't get through: the door held. Party-leader guy and I again high-fived each other, then turned our attention to the last door. "We have to hurry", we reasoned, "Find something valuable we can grab, then run back to the surface, before they ram through the door and get us from behind." Perhaps we started debating whether leaving an adventurer to stand guard to this room was a good plan.<br/>Our comrades in arms, though, looked at the clock in exasperation. It's entirely possible someone asked the DM, out of character, "How many rooms in this dungeon?" (it was a number in the high 20s).<br/>While the two of us debated how to best approach the third door (this one, you see, swung <i>out</i>, so dreadfully there would be no holding it shut on a retreat!), the halfling player let out a war-cry and kicked it open (to our gaping astonishment, but amongst the cheers of our so-far-unmentioned companions). Over the following 10 minutes, he then managed to rush through a dozen dungeon rooms, uncovering several hints as to some kind of plot, until, in an underground prison block, he encountered a terrifying flame-headed ghost. Winning surprise (or was it initiative?) the halfling even managed to land a (useless, I assume, but cathartic to him) sword-thrust onto the ghost, before being subsequently one-shotted dead by its level-draining touch.<br/>Thus, the halfling died a hero and was much celebrated. Then everybody left because our time was over and there were other games waiting for us. Most people attending that D&amp;D session loudly resolved never to play "old school" again:<i> "The only game where, when a hint of story seems to be coming at you, you turn and run"</i>. I had a good laugh to that, but truth is I did enjoy crawling through that first room (and perhaps didn't care much about the flaming ghost's backstory, at all).

This sort of game is very "sharp" in its creative agenda, which means not only that it's inspirational for those who like it, but also that it's very openly frustrating to those who don't. I've had similar experiences where players have not appreciated what the game has to offer. Old school D&amp;D when taken to an extreme of purity doesn't really do the traditional compromise thing where we pretend that all interests are satisfied and have a value.<br/><br/>In my case, though, it's a home game and a well-established campaign. There are a few more casual/ignorant players who wouldn't know the difference between D&amp;D and 7th Sea if they were put side by side, but most are fully aware about the nature of the game we're playing. That first story happened in session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2352&amp;Mode=like">#52</a>, after we had already played for several hundred hours with these same people.<br/><br/>In my second anecdote, by the way, we broke up the session after the TPK and then reconvened later that same week to play some more - new characters, same dungeon, as the players wanted to conquer the Blocks of Quox. The player base at the time consisted of local high schoolers in the summer, so they had a lot of time for this, and excitement to spare. I remember asking at the time whether the players wanted to continue with D&amp;D, and they were eager to do so despite the setback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463612/#Comment_463612" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-29T18:33:45+00:00" title="May 29, 2017  6:33PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is why lots of people embrace herd stupidity and have fun with it too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463613/#Comment_463613" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-29T18:56:41+00:00" title="May 29, 2017  6:56PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, that's totally possible too.

The rest are either herd followers who go fo the social exchange, power fantasy gamers who just want to show off how much agency their characters are capable of and players who want to immerse in being their characters. There is more as lots of player categorization lists describe and no player is just an archetype, everyone will enjoy a mix of things in different degrees and tolerate others in order to have their fun or not ruin everyone's fun.<br/><br/>But if you want a game focused on the tactics, you can. You will need players more interested in this kind of play (of which yes, there are lots) and make sure everyone is on the same page about what is expected from the players. It's interesting that in this gamestyle everything is more about what the players plan and try. If they don't plan and try the wrong things, it's their fault if they get TPKed. If it happens because of bad luck, that's the game. And whatever is the result they can't blame the GM, because being impartial was her job and she did it. Here players will actually ruin their and the GM's fun if they don't go slower, acquire more information before acting and think things through. <br/><br/>Still, 20 rooms is just too much for a single shot game. I'd go for the five room adventure in this case.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>We talked a bit about this with some other GMs last night and I think it's worth to mention miscommunication problems could be a bigger issue than we may think. At one point in the conversation one of the GMs framed an scenario as an example to a GM which normally advocates for old school. The guy is no stupid, yet it took three times for him to finally focus and get the idea of the given scenario. Not that this happens all the time with all the players (the rest of us got it fine the first time), but even a sharp person can get distracted, or maybe it's the way the GM framed the scene that gives a mistaken idea.<br/><br/>Now extend that to the explanations about how the game is supposed to work and the mess expands geometrically. They even get mixed in the head of the players with previous game experiences, deeply burned in their minds because there were moments of intense emotion that helped imprint those memories. So, again, it's not like we can't learn new games or new ways of playing the same games. It's more like, at least 2 out of 9 moments of herd stupidity (maybe even more) will be unavoidable in any group, even on those trying to not turn that into their "usual" gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463656/#Comment_463656" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-01T21:51:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2017  9:51PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the sake of curiousity, I'll note that we had another session tonight, and the team decided to retry the Gingerbread Princess scenario. Throwing another party in after a loss is relatively common for us, and I generally accede to it for the sake of the pedagogy whenever the fictional situation remains meaningful: the players get to try things a different way, which is useful for contrasting the outcomes and thus learning how different strategies work out.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the session we did a bit of strategic exegesis on the events of the last session - talked over the stuff that we've discussed here as well. (We often do this stuff at the beginning of sessions, as the players tend to leave for home quickly at the end.) Some players already had their own analysis of what went wrong, while it came as news to others how funny the events seemed in hindsight. The armchair analysis probably played a part in motivating the players to try again.<br/><br/>The second party included one member of the first party who'd escaped the pitched battle at the end and  spent 14 weeks of elf-time in the outback of the fae dimension, subsisting mainly on candies and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A4mmi" rel="nofollow">m\xe4mmi</a> (from the great m\xe4mmi swamps he discovered during his exile). I'd been assuming him to have been a goner due to his hopeless situation, but as the players decided to put together a second party, the poor bastard got a second chance before losing all his teeth to tooth decay.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters were either loners who'd gotten drawn into the hellhole by a certain fairy creature (Mistysparkles, the Clip Clopping Lord of the Dark Fae, to be specific), or members of the refugee/captive village in the process of being slowly ground down by the inhuman conditions in the village. The party was desperate to begin with, but at least they had some inkling of the dangers now - the players because they had experience from last session, the characters because two of them were old-timers who'd survived in this dimension for months.<br/><br/>The players spent a considerable amount of time perfecting a fire-making technique for arsonizing gingerbread houses, in the interest of creating a distraction for the village guard devils. The plan evolved under them, though, and ultimately the arson became a minor backup element in a plan mainly reliant on stealth - they would go with the climbing thief strategy, with two characters who'd sneak into the magic-user's tower to seek the leverage they'd surely need.<br/><br/>The execution lacked flair at times, but overall the plan went down without a hitch - the nights in the candy kingdom were pitch black, and it was relatively easy to go undetected, as long as one was capable of climbing the tower at all. The two thieves were the most passive/casual/inexperienced players in the crew, which meant that the other players were left advicing them in the abstract while they made the crucial choices about what the do inside the tower.<br/><br/>As it happened, the 11-year old nephew of mine did something no other player in the group probably would: upon encountering a bedroom with a young girl propped upon the bed, asleep or in a drugged stupor, he promptly killed the helpless girl in her bed on the principle that she might be the secret form of the magic-user in the tower. She was not, but she certainly was the linchpin that held the whole fairy subrealm together: killing her was a quick and easy way out of the fae dimension for all living humans in there.<br/><br/>This was ultimately the least kind of victory in the D&amp;D totem pole of outcomes: the party got out alive, but with no treasures or other benefits. The new party didn't have any real rewards lined up for the rescue, and the little treasure the two thieves had collected disappeared into the aether with the fairy world. Much of the tower was left veiled in mystery. The party didn't really dare to confess to their part in saving the refugees, either, as they didn't want to spread the knowledge that one of them had slain the little girl - even if trading one life for the lives of many might be justified, the adventurers felt guilty nevertheless.<br/><br/>So no big score for us this time out, either. We'll presumably continue trying next week, with new adventures (which I've pretty much got lined up already, as I didn't expect us to take a second trip to the candy land tonight).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463658/#Comment_463658" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-01T23:32:36+00:00" title="June  1, 2017 11:32PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scary stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463669/#Comment_463669" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-02T22:17:49+00:00" title="June  2, 2017 10:17PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are great stories, Eero.<br/><br/>I have seen this kind of "herd stupidity" numerous times, and especially so in in this kind of gaming idiom. I agree with your analysis of it.<br/><br/>I think that a big part of it is the high potential for boredom in this gaming style - very often making *something* happen becomes a priority for the group, and suboptimal choices are made.<br/><br/>However, it's also worthwhile to remember that choices in such games are not made in a vacuum. There is a deliberate context of limited information for the characters and players, and it's not hard (in that context) to become certain that you are doing something clever (e.g. trying to kill the wizard in the tower) even while you are totally misguided.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this happens in part because logical leaps ("The wizard must be the linchpin!") are necessary in this style of adventuring, and in part because it's impossible to predict with great certainty how a given GM will handle a given fictional situation.<br/><br/>Put those two things in superimposition, and some really wacky - and, in retrospect, stupid - choices become fairly common.<br/><br/>For instance, I played a D&amp;D game once where the party was fleeing a giant stone statue which could breathe fire. The available exit was a narrow and steep tunnel/chimney carved in the rock, which we could navigate only via a rope we had attached at the top.<br/><br/>It seemed abundantly clear to me that a panicked group of individuals trying to climb a rope in a very tight space, one at a time, while an enemy behind them could simply breathe fire into the space at its leisure... was certain suicide. It was a large party, too - hard for me to imagine them making it through such a spot in a panicked hurry, as that's not how humans generally operate under such conditions. I expected anyone to try this to get roasted alive while trying to hustle one after the other through the chimney.<br/><br/>So, my character, unlike the others, jumped off a bridge and hid underneath (underwater, for as long as he could).<br/><br/>Much to my surprise, the GM's reading of the situation was that the climb could be made easily, and let everyone make their way through with a fairly easy roll of some sort.<br/><br/>That made my character's daring gambit rather silly in retrospect, even though, from my perspective, it was the only choice which might have allowed him to survive at all. (As it turned out, I found a way to distract the monster, tricked it into destroying a couple of lizardmen in my way, and eventually made it back to the group with a single hit point remaining or something similar - a few lucky rolls later!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463671/#Comment_463671" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-03T01:16:00+00:00" title="June  3, 2017  1:16AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was one of the biggest reasons that has kept me apart from this kind of gameplay actually. It's always been a big turnoff for me to see how smart player actions end up being treated as stupid just because there was some sort of miscommunication on how the scene was framed, how the system worked, etc. <br/><br/>It wasn't only nor always that players did something stupid, it was also the GM hiding information because that was part of his work as a GM (the players didn't asked the right questions, so they had no right to know that information) but doing it so well that players attention fell elsewhere and they made decisions based on incomplete information, which often ended up turning a well planned tactic into the worst idea ever.<br/><br/>That's why I ended up feeling better about changing my prep and embracing the players viewpoint (the so-called herd stupidity), because <i>you can't always have a perfectly clear communication</i>. Yes, you can try again, rewind the game to the last play, but we had enough bad experiences with that trick (with another GM), that ended up making that practice a poor one in our book.

The home-made variety is much more interesting than the stuff you get from stores.<br/><br/>Regarding GM subjectivity and the difficulty of perfect communication between flawed human beings, I don't myself find it such a fundamental issue. This is perhaps because I perceive the striving for "truth in wargaming" as a process and not so much a foundational truth upon which the entire game rests. The GM tries their best, the group works to improve their communication, the players account for GM imperfection in their planning (as part of their fog of war, essentially), and as long as the end result is more strategic than flipping a coin, there is a game there still even if the GM sometimes fails to be perfect. Giving up on the wargame vision that D&amp;D espouses (and that I, frankly, would like to see in more wargames) because it's not perfect seems like a false dichotomy - that D&amp;D is not perfect according to arbitrary criteria does not mean that it necessarily has a problem that can or should be addressed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463699/#Comment_463699" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T19:48:30+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  7:48PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2017 7:49PM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well Eero, looks that it hasn't happened consistently enough times to you to consider it a matter important enough. It has happened to me and a lot of other groups enough times and consistently to give us a different viewpoint in the subject. But I don't mean it like we're right and you're wrong. We're both right and wrong depending on which group we play with and our personal skills to handle the game, which happen to be different. <br/><br/>So please, with all due respect, don't minimize our problem as unreal or uninportant, I do get that you don't have the same problems as us, I'm happy about that and I'm not telling you to change anything in your play style, specially not for the sake of avoiding problems that you don't have. But it's the same for us, as much as I respect and understand your point about old school D&amp;D, I can't neither avoid the mentioned problem nor solve it in the same way you do, as our groups are different and our GMing skills are different.<br/><br/>That said, I just wanted to state that I had this problem and I consider it a valid one. I see that Paul considers it has a bit of relevance too, that's enough for me. From time to time I like to check if I'm not just hearing voices on my mind. I don't think that this particular problem really deserves any deeper discussion though, so I'm fine to drop the subject, watch the discussion continue and maybe add something on a different aspect if I can think of it later.

My take on it as that Eero (and, likely, the people he plays with) has developed ways of communicating this stuff extremely well, and handling it reliably. Sure, it's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good.<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, I could be imagining things here, but from what I've read of your playstyle here on Story Games, your style of play is much less transparent (you talk of "maintaining the illusion", fudging some of the rules in play, and avoiding discussing certain topics in play so as not to "ruin immersion"), so perhaps it's quite a natural consequence that this kind of play would be more difficult to achieve reliably.<br/><br/>It's just a guess on my part, of course. In any case (even if it's entirely wrong), my first paragraph, above, stands: Eero's developed a lot of communication techniques (and an appropriate play culture) for this kind of play. You can see it for yourself by reading his posts on the subject here, and I can attest that it's a pretty good reflection of how he actually runs games.<br/><br/>Eero, I'm curious how much of that holds when others GM games in your local scene? Is there a learning curve, people try to play another way, and so on? If so, does it ever become something to work around, or do groups simply accept different styles of play? What's the gamut of experiences like for you, when it comes to this topic?

So the question boils down to how people pick up and retain Forgite analytics here.<br/><br/>It seems that some people pick up methodological influence much more readily than others. There's a guy here in Finland who played a 100 sessions of D&amp;D with me and went on to run a practically picture-perfect copy of my campaign in another town, for example, developing their own powerful GMing style. And there's another one who listened to a couple of lectures, participated in three or four sessions, and then went on to do his own thing (different mechanics, but still methodologically pure challenge-based OSR D&amp;D). But then there's folks who can take those 100 sessions and then go on and try to do something similar, only to fall into generic '90s habits; this phenomenon makes me suspect that the gamers in question never perceived or understood what I was doing differently - to them it was just "good GMing". Sort of like the stories where people play a Forgite story game and then congratulate the GM for the great story [grin].<br/><br/>More generally, I don't think that the local scene, or the Finnish scene in general, is that much more regimented and self-conscious, or facile in communication, than what you'd usually expect. Usually I feel more like I'm an island of order in a sea of confusion. It's probably about the same as in the Americas. Running mediocrely GMed traditional adventure games is an infinitely intriguing pastime, it seems to me. (And it is, of course, one that I fully endorse - can't grow as an artist without making art, right?)<br/><br/>I have picked up a habit of labelling things early, often and authoritatively, which is of course immensely annoying to many people when I talk about something other than my own gaming. For example, I play for an hour at somebody's OSR table and then declare them "procedurally rigorous", or I call them "mid-school storytelling D&amp;D" or whatever. This sort of analytical base behavior does clarify things a lot for everybody concerned (as long as somebody doesn't dislike a label), and has often resulted in people achieving a more purposeful playstyle as they purify whatever it is they do. I like to think that games I play in tend to be more purposeful and self-aware than average even when I'm not GMing, simply because I have so many communication behaviors that don't seem to turn off simply because I'm being a player - I still explain everything the GM does in procedural terms to the other players, for instance [grin].<br/><br/>There are folks with similarly analytic approach to gaming here in Finland, but aside from the OSR folks I've trained myself, they're pretty much all Forgites - after all, the foundational ideas like "not all rpgs are the same" and "we should understand what it is that we're trying to do, and put it in words" have sort of a high correlation with some sort of Forgite past right now. Again, I imagine it's similar elsewhere as well - you'd rarely see a trad gamer or a freeformer or such with a well-developed analytical toolset. Lately I've started seeing people with a sort of hybrid background, though - like, they're otherwise trad expect they've played Apocalypse World and read enough RPG.net to pick up a sort of inquisitive, open-minded attitude. I expect that soon enough the distinctive Forgite analytical mindset melds into a general "well-versed in RPGs" skillset as cultural ideas spread and mix together in various ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463725/#Comment_463725" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-05T22:55:17+00:00" title="June  5, 2017 10:55PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes total sense to me, Eero.<br/><br/>I've also started running into younger gamers who were introduced into the hobby with Forgite or collaborative story games, and that's all they know of gaming.

Even when it's kinda obvious for me that all I did was steal the players idea, the thing is that when you build upon it and connect it really well with your prep, the difference between both becomes blurry, and players can't be sure if they actually read through your plans (which does happen some times) or if it was you who made their worst fears come to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463761/#Comment_463761" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-08T04:28:46+00:00" title="June  8, 2017  4:28AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Oh I think it's there already under some other form, I also use that phrase a lot!

I wouldn't call myself an extremist on this (it's not like I refuse to repeat myself when giving out information or anything like that), but the information theory of this sort of wargaming seems clear to me: like two thirds of the strategic challenge in D&amp;D is about conceptualizing and enumerating your goals and options. The first challenge is to understand what you need to accomplish, the second is to invent a means to achieve your goal, and it's only the third step to make a choice between the various options at your disposal.<br/><br/>I could hypothetically take a position where it's up to the GM to provide a clear and constant "decision-making matrix" for the players, with their best and most relevant options ranked out and noted for their likely consequences. This would not be dissimilar to a constantly updating "choose your own adventure" game in a way. However, what exactly would be left of the skill element in the game if the GM did this? Aren't many of the more interesting and complex challenges in D&amp;D rather trivial if the GM does the thinking (outside the box as well as inside) on the players' behalf?<br/><br/>It is true that there are challenges where the choice still remains a tricky one after thorough analysis, so I would not claim that this kind of D&amp;D would be entirely trivial for the players. It would also have the potential to be much quicker and more streamlined; if the players only need to care about the proceedings at explicit decision-making points, then the GM can just develop the situation in between, and the players should not theoretically have any need to interrupt with their own maneuvers - after all, the GM will prompt them for a choice when a real one appears. I think this could be quite entertaining (and very unlike traditional D&amp;D) when taken to a sufficient extreme.<br/><br/>I think that the GM should not entertain on-the-spot simulation quite blindly in this kind of D&amp;D, because it's not fair: if you simulate the scenario as you go, but you're also the person who chooses the decision-making points and conceptualizes the options, then what happens if you forget to ask them something important, or a random process causes an unexpected problem? For example, what if you forget to ask the players about packing winter clothes, and then later there's a blizzard due to a random weather model? This ideal of D&amp;D works much better if you figure out in advance that there's going to be a blizzard during the adventure, so you can slip in the idea of maybe preparing for the weather or not into the decision-making matrix at some point - then if the adventurers all freeze to death it's their own fault, as the option of purchasing winter clothes was clearly delineated for them earlier. The players obviously cannot account for this themselves, because we've agreed upon a form of D&amp;D where the GM prompts them for choices where applicable - at most they could find the winter clothes in an shop inventory list you give them for purchases, but if this particular item is not listed, we would not want to ask them to think outside the box like that.<br/><br/>An observation about D&amp;D where the strategic conceptualization challenge is not desired: in addition to using explicit options-listing, the GM should probably simply avoid non-standard situations. Dungeons are great for this sort of D&amp;D precisely because the strategic options are so limited: we can go either left or right, we can either attack or retreat being the major ones. Indeed, in basic dungeoneering the GM hardly needs to do strategic analysis on the behalf of the players the way he would need to in a more open-ended scenario.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463765/#Comment_463765" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-08T15:19:01+00:00" title="June  8, 2017  3:19PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Not sure what you mean about losing strength with multiple players. </p></div></blockquote>\nI just mean that if more than one player complains, group pressure can increase to the point where the GM will have an easier time conceding into the players viewpoint, as defending her position will bring the game to a temporary halt.

Failing to come up with a good plan because you forget something that's obvious to your character is, to me, not an instance of failing at a challenge, but rather an instance of a poor challenge situation.<br/><br/>Why do I think it's poor?  Well, for starters, I've never seen it done explicitly -- "Hey everyone, your challenge is to remember stuff your characters would know!  This is a memory-based skill game!  Taking notes is allowed, but you'll have to choose wisely what to write down, because there won't be time to write it all!  I talk too fast!"  I've also never seen players be proud of simply remembering what's present in the fiction, as if that were some sort of accomplishment.  So I don't see any upside here.  I do see plenty of downside, though, as even when there's no explicit contract of "you will always have all the tools your characters would have", many players have found it muddy and frustrating when Barbarian Barnag's siege challenge becomes Player Pete's memory/interpretation challenge.<br/><br/>As for step one, I'm not sure what you mean.  Isn't "What we want to accomplish" simply up to player/character preference?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463768/#Comment_463768" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-08T21:31:27+00:00" title="June  8, 2017  9:31PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I have played some games in this style with both of you (Eero and David), I can comment a little on the difference in style. Perhaps that will help!<br/><br/>I think your general approach to communicating decision points and discussing options with the players is pretty similar overall (and far more so than this discussion might make it sound, anyway).<br/><br/>* Dave, your approach in that discussion/negotiation is focused pretty heavily on the character's perspective.<br/><br/>You would generally speak a lot about what the character can see and what they know. This is where you might mention things that they can perceive, things they might know, or things they might have forgotten.<br/><br/>If the player is making some suboptimal choice, you might point out these problems at this point - "You know that when X happens, there's often a danger of Y. You've seen that kind of thing happen before in these situations, like that time when you [...] a while back. That could easily be the case here if you don't things just right. Do you still want to proceed?"<br/><br/>* Eero's approach is subtly different in that he is more concerned with properly communicating the resolution process, and how the action taking place might be resolved.<br/><br/>He might speak of the way we are going to handle any particular plan in terms of resolving it - what factors are involved, what mechanical implication there are from your fictional choices, and what decision points the GM is seeing here.<br/><br/>If the player is making some suboptimal choice, Eero might be more likely to address that simply by talking them through the process of resolution they are signing up for - "If you want to do X, we'll need to make ability checks to establish whether these and these factors are under your control. You could probably improve your chances if you could find some way of minimizing the danger of Y, though - perhaps that would turn into a +5 bonus on the appropriate ability check, or an automatic success if your methods are really foolproof."<br/><br/>Overall, the gameplay isn't too different; describing the differences exaggerates them dramatically, since we're focusing on them so much. You both are pretty careful to establish all the factors with the players so that they can be well-informed when they carry through with the decision.<br/><br/>That's been my impression, based on our gaming together, anyway! Feel free to correct me, of course, but that's what I've seen.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463771/#Comment_463771" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T00:42:43+00:00" title="June  9, 2017 12:42AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As for step one, I'm not sure what you mean.  Isn't "What we want to accomplish" simply up to player/character preference?</p></div></blockquote>\nSo it is, but because some things turn out more sensible or useful or desirable or simple to achieve as goals, players may still choose poorly in this regard. Because that decision-making impacts character success at such fundamental level, I find it part of the strategic decision-making in the game.<br/><br/>For example, consider a character who gets lost in fairyland. What do they even want from the situation? To know that, one would need to understand the situation. What if it's a chance for great wealth, shouldn't the character take that chance? Or what if fairyland can only offer them delusion and the loss of their immortal soul? Could they gain great magics or powerful friends? Should they try? I think that seeing the possibilities and choosing to pursue them is also a strategic choice.<br/><br/>As another example, consider an outright bad adventure hook: say that a 1st level beginner party decides to pursue a greatly over-leveled challenge, such as slaying a dragon terrorizing the countryside. This is probably a bad choice, because the odds of success likely do not balance out against the size of the reward (particularly if none is on offer and they're just acting on heroic instinct). A more strategically minded player realizes this and instead casts their character in an ancillary role more suited to them - perhaps they'll take on the quest to find a True Hero to slay the dragon, for example, which sounds much more like something a low-level party might accomplish.<br/><br/>(This second one is actually a pretty good measure of just how sandboxy your campaign really is, I feel: if the group takes it as a given that when the GM offers a dragon-slaying they should take it, perhaps it's not much of a sandbox after all.)<br/><br/>This sort of smart analysis of the possibilities, and allocation of goals, is the first step in intelligent sandbox D&amp;D strategy, I think. After you know what you're even trying to accomplish, it's time to figure out the options you have for advancing your cause.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463774/#Comment_463774" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T01:11:22+00:00" title="June  9, 2017  1:11AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you have a group of people discussing alternative approaches to a thing, there's a weird phenomenon that often happens in which early, rational suggestions get sidelined by later suggestions that may not be as rational.

I mean, in every game I can remember, everyone was either reluctant to ask for that role, was considered a jerk for appointing themselves for the role or thought "it's okay, we will just follow whoever seems to have the best idea on how to proceed". It was only when the game explicitly called for giving someone the role of party leader (as in 3:16) that we had players appointed to that task. <br/><br/>(it was really cool from that game to give the players directives on how to play their roles, though it didn't gave them much idea of the tactics. Not that it was too important to play the game but it could have helped)<br/><br/>The thing here is that, leaders need time and practice to develop leadership skills, they need to be organized, they need to recognize a good tactic when they hear one, they need to have some charisma to be able to convince the group. If you're asking for more tactical thinking from the players and complaining how cool tactical ideas get lost in the herd stupidity, you could probably be a bit better appointing a party leader, let the players switch on the role until they find who's best for it and then it should be easier to escalate into deeper and deeper tactical thinking.<br/><br/>Like having standard procedures or formations for certain usual situations so they can save actual game time, just say "usual door opening, formation B" and focus on the minutia for opening this particular door instead of wasting an hour discussing how to go about it. Dunno, what do you think about this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463782/#Comment_463782" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T17:22:52+00:00" title="June  9, 2017  5:22PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three methods I've seen:<br/><br/>* Based on fictional elements<br/><br/>In a "character stable", sandbox-style game, each adventure tends to be "organized" by one of the PCs. They find an adventure hook, convince others to go with them, plan and/or pay for the venture.<br/><br/>Sometimes it might just be the only character who survived the previous attempt, or the only one who *knows* about the adventure in the first place (for instance, the one who found the treasure map!).<br/><br/>In this case, the leadership role falls quite naturally to them.<br/><br/>* Formalized/rule-based<br/><br/>I like the idea of establishing a formal way of declaring a leader, as well, though. It might be as simple as assuming that the character who rolled the highest starting wealth is the leader of the current outfit, for instance.<br/><br/>In my own dungeon crawler, you roll for social standing/background, and the character with the best outcome is the leader. You might get an expedition formed of two escaped slaves, an army deserter, a mercenary, and a noble's son trying to prove himself. The rest naturally suggests itself...<br/><br/>* Social contract<br/><br/>In other groups, it's not about the characters at all, but the *players*. Someone is the most veteran player, or the clearest manager of actions, someone knows the rules best, someone has been at the table the longest. We agree to allow that person to take the lead, and play our characters accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463783/#Comment_463783" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T18:30:59+00:00" title="June  9, 2017  6:30PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great! Now, would you say that actually having a party leader had any influence on the gameplay? Would you say in retrospect that a player clearly made a difference in that role, there were less moments of herd stupidity?<br/><br/>In our 3:16 short run we had different players try the role, some still made bad choices, but realized it was because the players who understood what was going on didn't talk until it was too late, because they thought the leader had heard something they didn't. Having a leader at least sets a procedure for agreeing on group decisions, but perhaps you still need to encourage some discussion and sharing information, even if it looks like everyone heard and understood the same.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Old School D&amp;D is about herd

If there's any dispute over party leadership, we go to Paul's third way, the mechanical systemization: whoever wins a mainly Charisma-based staring contest gets it, and if another PC can't stand it, they walk out and the player makes a new character who is willing to accept the party leadership.<br/><br/>So it's a complex system overall.<br/><br/>In general everything you write about is fully in play with us, and it's all just as great in practice as it seems in theory: players learn to be better leaders, already-experienced ones train them for it, and parties definitely fare worse under more haphazard leadership. Leadership and group cooperation in general matter a great deal, the game is not just about rolling dice.<br/><br/>Considering our current crew of regulars, some are eminently more suited to the leadership role than others. Nevertheless, the players regularly let each other try out for it, particularly when characters bring in adventure hooks that place them squarely in the middle of the action. My 11-year old nephew is an example of a hopeless case - the campaign in general plays far, far too complex in wargaming terms for him to make a good leader at his development level (wouldn't be much of a skill game if this was not the case, frankly). Another player who ranks "very bad" in leadership terms is an adult, but fails due to lack of concentration, motivation, imagination, general gaming experience, leadership skills and sheer step-on-up. The rest of the regulars are good-to-great leaders who trade off the role all the time:<br/><b>*</b> One's got the distinction that he's an excellent roleplayer and consequently understands fictional spaces and situations very well, often far ahead of anybody else. He is also well-versed in general cultural history as well as history of warfare, which means that he'll usually at least know what is the expected orthodox approach to various martial and social challenges.<br/><b>*</b> One's got ther distinction that he's very careful and methodical, considerate of the adventuring party's benefits, and simply hungry for success: he often avoids danger and pinpoints benefit in situations with much more efficiency than anybody else. He's got the weakness that he's very strategically timid (unwilling to take risks), which has led the party to its doom in the past.<br/><b>*</b> One's got the distinction that he's new to roleplaying and very excited about the campaign, drinking it down in great quaffs and enjoying the new experiences. His seriousness, love for his characters and the level of effort he puts to it translate into considerate play that truly strives for that fabulous 2nd level, which in turn generally means that he leads the party well and towards success.<br/><br/>I should note that despite having people who I think are well on their way to becoming great leaders of men in the group, the challenge of D&amp;D, herd stupidity included, is considerable. The third person in my overview there was leading the show in the TPK discussed in the OP, and I do not think that I am being unfair if I say that he's the one who should have caught it: he was the leader, chairmanning the strategy session, and he pushed for the disastrous frontal assault.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Like having standard procedures or formations for certain usual situations so they can save actual game time, just say "usual door opening, formation B" and focus on the minutia for opening this particular door instead of wasting an hour discussing how to go about it. Dunno, what do you think about this?</p></div></blockquote>\nI love this shit when I'm in the player side. Streamlining smart play is one of my favourite things to do in D&amp;D - not as something where the game's rules and procedures take away complications, but rather as something the players do as part of their increasing skill level.<br/><br/>I sometimes see other people do this as well, but not nearly as much. I think it's probably because they enjoy other facets of play more, which is totally fine.<br/><br/>But when I'm being a player - and this is from experience, I've had the privilege of playing in two excellent challenge-based sandbox D&amp;D campaigns in recent years - it's all about being just as serious a gamer as the GM is: I'm not there to be entertained, I'm there to bring an excellent showing as a wargamer: there'll be realistic simulation, insightful arguments and good strategic thinking.<br/><br/>Standardizing gear load-outs, exploration procedure and entry tactics, and adapting those, is very much something I like to do as a player in D&amp;D. I've sometimes considered writing up a TacOp guide of some sort for my co-players, just to make it easier to communicate complex processes. "Turn to page 4 if you would, I've listed both the mandatory personal gear as well as my recommendations for 1st level characters, separated by tactical role. If you can't afford the spec with your starting wealth, the company will loan out the difference free of interest. Also familiarize yourself with pages 8-10, everything you need to know as a Scout is in there."<br/><br/>My experience is that most of the benefit from doing this kind of leadership does not come directly in the form of quicker play, though - rather, we tend to get <i>deeper</i> play. In ideal conditions dungeoneering becomes much quicker with formal tacop procedures, certainly, but there's also all the time you spend teaching the other players your operational art, and the added level of depth tends to slow things down as well, so it's not a given that the game will go any faster than with happy-go-lucky leadership. More fun, yes, but not necessarily quicker.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That sounds great! Now, would you say that actually having a party leader had any influence on the gameplay? Would you say in retrospect that a player clearly made a difference in that role, there were less moments of herd stupidity?</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is absolutely the case with us. I would approximate that the party leader is usually responsible for something like one third of the overall success in our campaign (that is, of all the crucial points where things might go wrong, the party leader is on hand to influence and be responsible for the outcome in one third of them). Different leaders process the input from the other players in different ways, but generally they all have a great influence in what the party actually does, and how.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463792/#Comment_463792" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T20:44:54+00:00" title="June  9, 2017  8:44PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Your "Tactical Manual" sounds like a very interesting bit of work.

If I think that D&amp;D is an objectively skill-based game, why shouldn't I treat it as something that could have a "walkthrough", after all...<br/><br/>More seriously, though, I suppose that a well-ordered manual would be a fit format. It would be written rules-agnostic and setting-agnostic, but not system-agnostic (that is, it would assume the method of wargamey old school D&amp;D, and the general setup of the sandbox campaign). It might as well include strategic, logistical and operational aspects of play as well as literal tactics. I would like to cover at least these things:<br/><b>*</b> Adventure negotiation - how to get hooks out of the GM, how to choose between them.<br/><b>*</b> Different types of adventures, how to identify them and what to do with the knowledge.<br/><b>*</b> Equipping, hiring retainers for different scenarios.<br/><b>*</b> Best practices for wilderness travel, searching, camping.<br/><b>*</b> Best practices for dungeon travel, scouting, fortifying, survival.<br/><b>*</b> Commando tactics: hard and soft entry, threat evaluation, etc.<br/><b>*</b> Risk-evaluation in highly uncertain situations.<br/><b>*</b> Conducting looting efficiently.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Can you provide some examples?</p></div></blockquote>\nSure. Consider these snippets of wisdom (or perchance lack of wisdom - either way, they're issues on which I believe it is possible to have good protocols, it's not all just roll of the dice).<br/><br/><b>*</b> Did you know that adventures that involve savage tribes are common at low levels, very easy to spot in advance (as in, you know that there's goblins in this adventure before you'll actually have to deal with them), and tactically very predictable? The ideal dungeon tactic is disciplined closed-order melee (think hoplites or legionnaires) with 6+ combatants, capable of bringing more force to bear against loose-order enemies, breaking weaker lines where needed, and scattering a superior number of savages. If an acceptable front line cannot be mustered (often the case for a first outing crew), I recommend leaving that adventure for the fools - intelligent savages are very dangerous, a dungeon tribe generally has well over a dozen combat-capables, and nothing in particular prevents them from gathering the whole posse to crush you if you can't control chokepoints and bring the battle to them in short order. If you absolutely have to despite not having the strength for it, then do stealthy scouting, retreat at the alarm, develop a lure, attract the tribal warriors out of the dungeon, and then get in and out before they come back.<br/><br/><b>*</b> Did you know that after the savage tribes, the second-most common low-level monster is the non-intelligent undead? (Skeletons, zombies - ghouls generally have low cunning and therefore don't count here.) These are also generally easy to spot well in advance. The favoured tactic is to build and transport portable fortifications that provide the defenders significant advantage, or even prevent the undead outright from endangering the defense, and then just poking them to bits with heavy polearms from a safe distance. (This works because of the "non-intelligent" part - the enemy chooses to attack even against bad odds.) The traditional "portable fortification" is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantlet" rel="nofollow">mantlet</a>, which I recommend to be built in sections about 3 feet wide, with robust backstops preventing enemies from pushing it over, and with a height up to a man's chest or so; it is important that three pieces block a dungeon corridor and that retainers can carry and operate each piece, and that fighters can operate long spears over-hand over them.<br/><br/><b>*</b> Did you know that adventurers who don't carry their personal light-sources cannot search effectively underground unless Light magic or similar is used? Your own shadow blocks any central light source, and centrally positioned ordinary torches and lanters shed much too little light to enable you to check the room corners for intricate details such as hidden treasures or passages - you need that torch up close and personal, either in your own hand or that of a personal retainer. A party should, therefore, have lightning flexibility: in marching order a single lantern up front but low (helps preserve dark vision, easy to find the grouping point if anybody lags behind), and when exploring a room everybody lights a personal torch off a central source. You can always drop it in an emergency, it's moronic to fight over who has to carry the light. Remember to post guards when investigating stuff - and the guards don't carry torches, they need their dark vision.<br/><br/>Playing this game is basically about thinking this stuff - I believe that anybody who's wasted a few hundred hours on this could talk your ears off about the art and science of dungeon commando operations. Saying that it's all about play group communication or something like that seems rather opposite to my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463813/#Comment_463813" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-10T16:22:29+00:00" title="June 10, 2017  4:22PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My goodness, that's a lot of stuff! I mean, I expected something like this when you wrote about a tactical manual, but these samples tell me that your basic 1st level adventurer manual should probably be around 20-40 pages long at least. But still it surprises me the amount of basic knowledge required. No wonder you get frustrated with herd stupidity here and there, this level of "basic knowledge" seems far above even regular veteran knowledge outside old school.<br/><br/>Not to say you should run a simpler game, but for me this makes really important the presence of such tactical manual, since for players to amass this amount of basic knowledge would need several sessions of trial an error.<br/><br/>I don't mean to underestimate players, it's perfectly feasible to learn all this, somewhat quickly and have tons of fun doing it, it's not really a chore. But I don't think a regular D&amp;D player is aware that tactical dungeon delving could go this deep. For me it looks like this could catch them off guard and turn any tactical decision they think smart for a vanilla D&amp;D game into a really stupid one. <br/><br/>It's quite different to pretend you're a character in a medieval fantasy movie than to pretend you're an actual adventurer and players not used to tactical old school tend to confuse both things as the same. They expect things to happen with a familiar narrative pace and when nothing happens they get frustrated and instigate. They kick the door, make the monster show up, the traps spring, stop caring about safety and common sense. <br/><br/>Yes, they are being stupid sim-wise, but they are being smart story-wise. Or at least they think so, as here they are clearly mistaken by thinking the logic behind the world in this gameplay style has anything to do with the narrative they are thinking of. <br/><br/>I mean, the kid who killed the princess to stop the spell wasn't roleplaying a demented assassin, he probably thought "this is the kind of story where characters who seem innocent are the actual criminal in disguise" and took a shortcut. That was "out of the box" smart thinking, but he neither tried to confirm this hypothesis before crossing the line of no return, nor thought "doing that without a sound excuse will shed a bad light on my character" and jumped to conclussions instead.<br/><br/>So in this gameplay, things like the manual and having the most experienced player as a leader (perhaps by stating that as true in-game too, so the other characters can believeable rely on him despite social position) should be a must to reinforce any pre-game talk you're already giving the players about the complexity and nature of the game. And particularily, you may like to warn them not to expect narrative-logic based decisions to bear fruits, that will just get them killed and made them look like a "stupid herd"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463814/#Comment_463814" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-10T19:51:56+00:00" title="June 10, 2017  7:51PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, I agree about all that - I find this sort of game interesting precisely because it's so exotic and different. If old school D&amp;D was just about trad adventure gaming with old-fashioned game mechanics, why ever would I care about that? I don't have any aesthetics hang-ups on '70s D&amp;D - if anything I'm actively disinclined towards it aesthetically, even as I wallow in the wargame nature of the game like a pig in a sty.<br/><br/>And yes, we talk about the nature of the game all the time. Most of the players have been in the campaign for over 30 sessions, with some having prior experience with the playstyle from earlier campaigns. It's only the densest (and newest - we get new players regularly as one might expect) players who might still struggle with the basic conceit that it's a wargame and you're supposed to think smart.<br/><br/>I haven't gone into writing that tactical manual for our group because I'd find it unhygienic for the GM to provide a "right way" to do things. What if following the orthodox anti-skeleton playbook leads to a catastrophe one time? It'd be difficult to be the GM in that situation, when you're the one who recommended that strategy - essentially you promised that it would be the smart play to make. Much better for the GM to stay scrupulously out of it and let the players figure out for themselves how to do things.<br/><br/>Regarding "story based thinking", by the way, one shouldn't knock it entirely - it's not worthless in D&amp;D, I think. There are three basic reasons for why players with a good grasp on cultural traditions often have an advantage:<br/><b>*</b> Stories include lots of things that are outright true observations about human nature. Things in reality - or D&amp;D - are more often "like in stories" than not, really. Story-based thinking at least gives you a null hypothesis to work over when pondering about how some complex situation might turn out.<br/><b>*</b> The GM is influenced by stories, because he's just as story-based an animal as the players are. The campaign <i>may</i> be predicated on cultural sources that are pretty far from mainstream entertainment television, such as history, military history, alternative history, historical re-enactment, folkloristics, pulp fantasy literature, esoteric religions and whatever, but those are still all stories, and they're not completely alien to whatever the player might have in his head. We're still on the same planet with the GM.<br/><b>*</b> D&amp;D is structurally predicated on mixing realistic and thematic thinking: character classes and character levels, random encounters and hitpoint mechanics, for example, are all intended to emulate romantic storytelling conceits in contrast to the hopeless fantasy vietnam gameplay. A player who understands those conceits can make cynical use of them within the constraints of the game. It would be a misunderstanding to think that the game would privilege story logic, but it is in there, and all the more so at higher levels.<br/><br/>One of the best and most successful wargamey old-school D&amp;D players I've met is very drama-based as a player. They've gotten a character to 6th level (I'll tell you, that's much more impressive in context than it sounds) and their characters generally end up doing interesting things and succeeding more often than not. Part of it is that they've got a good general grasp on military history, but I'd say that most of it is because they establish character identity for their characters quickly and identify story patterns early; this enables them to cleave their character into a central position in a scenario, which in turn gives them access to high-reward opportunities that sometimes pay out greatly.<br/><br/>As an example of what I mean: in 2012 said player had a character in <i>Three Brides</i>, the LotFP adventure set in the idyllic little town of Pembrooktonshire. He came out of the events with a marriage to a rich carpet weaver's daughter, thanks to his unhesitatingly dramatic style of play; where the other players made boring choices, his character had bold motivations and he dared to play the social situation in town. The player doubled down on the situation by playing a bit of SimFactory with the carpet weaver's shop over the following in-game months, and the character only came out of the downtime when he got an adventure hook related to stealing some Persian carpet designs for the factory from a merchant in Amsterdam. Having accomplished that, his character took his savings (and the gratitude of his father-in-law) and started his own mercenary company, suitably in time to join the Italian Wars on the imperial side.<br/><br/>The same player in our current campaign has several interesting characters - they quickly become interesting because he characterizes them boldly and is an interesting human being with lots of ideas. His main character is still a 1st level wizard, but he's also the grey eminence pulling the strings for a local nobleman; the lover of a dark elf priestess in control of her own little spider cult; the guardian of a dimensional gate into Limbo. Absolutely excellent play, even if the character is still waiting for his payday in terms of experience points.<br/><br/>That sort of strategic play is not even possible for a player who doesn't have solid story patterns in their head - you need to have the imagination and imaginary models for what's possible to chart your way through the infinite possibilities. This is not the same thing as latching onto the first story that pops into your head and just expecting the GM to lean back to let it happen, but it is a form of story-based play, nevertheless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463820/#Comment_463820" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T02:08:26+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  2:08AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really enjoying this thread. I feel the need to restate that while the 'haha D&amp;D players are so dumb' is the knee-jerk interpretation, the original point is really about how groups of people in a planning context often group-think their way to a crummy plan, even when good plans were suggested.<br/><br/>For me as a player, herd mentality seems to set in when I've lost interest in the discussion, when the stakes seem too low for however I'm feeling at the moment. I most recently recall feeling this way about what score to take in Blades in the Dark. In that game, it doesn't matter a lot as the details all emerge later; whichever we choose is likely to be fun regardless.<br/><br/>I'll come back to this point.<br/><br/>There's a particular point I'm curious about, I'm not sure how I feel about it myself. I'll state it baldly, so it's easy to pick at:<br/><br/>From the perspective of the players joining a game that has a particular play style, the old-school, wargame-infused, 'combat as war' tactics aren't the outcome of "clever" or "sensible" choices, they're just a particular type of genre emulation: doing the stuff you read about in books about medieval war (build mantlets! smoke them out!), as opposed to doing the stuff you read about in sword &amp; sorcery stories (kick in the door, stab 'em in the back).<br/><br/>There's a prickle in the back of my mind that says, as GM, I'm not really a physics simulator. I have no idea how effective mantlets are in real life; whether carrying them into a cramped, dark dungeon to use against kobolds is so much work that it would outweigh the tactical benefit of standing behind one. I'm just really impressed when someone says they're going to use mantlets, because that pays homage to a type of story I like, that I give them a benefit. I want mantlets in the game.<br/><br/>For instance, in zombie stories, or Jurassic Park, the rule is that fences always fail. Best laid plans only work for a while, then "life finds a way", the barriers get overrun, and so on. Now, it's 100% a legitimate point that neither zombie nor dinosaur outbreaks have ever happened. But the significance of (say) archers or mud at Agincourt is something that just comes to me in a book that I choose to take on faith. The victory was ascribed to this or that, but maybe it was mostly about good hygiene?<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm not trying to veer into a kind of solipsism where nobody can know anything. Obviously Agincourt actually happened, and if smart people think it was down to the mantlets or whatever, they may well be right.<br/><br/>I'm just pointing out that given my own real-world experience with mantlets (none), I couldn't tell you they'd actually be really awesome against zombies, or terrible. As a GM or player, I make that assessment mostly on the kind of source material I'm trying to emulate, and I think a lot of players are in that situation as well.<br/><br/>Similarly, everything I know about fencing comes from Amber Diceless, a couple of lessons, and YouTube videos--which I imagine leaves me solidly unqualified (along with nearly everyone) to judge how a player's tactical choices in swordplay would fare against an owlbear.<br/><br/>When I'm trying to adjudicate those situations "fairly" or "realistically", all I have to go on is my own (mostly invented) mental model.<br/><br/>One of the cool things about Amber, was the essay in the middle about how swordplay works. It didn't load the game down with rules, but it provided an amazing level set for the sort of choices players might make, and how the GM should rule on them.<br/><br/>All this to say that, Eero, I'm really looking forward to your primer on tactics for fighting low-level monsters, because I think it would do the same kind of useful job that the Amber essay on fencing did: providing a level set for cool tactics to try, which the GM has an implied commitment to reward and treat as serious contributions.<br/><br/>To look at this from another angle, there are plenty of stories of games misfiring when players did something "dumb" (i.e. inspired by Conan instead of Agincourt), but I've experienced the reverse a few times, also.<br/><br/>I recall an encounter in a 3e D&amp;D linear dungeon where we fell afoul of the trap and lost a PC. (Some kind of hard-to-cross narrow bride, with a monster below.)<br/><br/>I had just read a book on cracking into pyramids, and since it had been established that the dungeon we were in was right below a mining town suffering from high unemployment, I got very excited about walking back up and paying our way to tunnel around the bridge.<br/><br/>This got groans all around because I was essentially out of the genre. The DM knew that the monster wasn't THAT bad, the death was down to some unlucky die rolls. (I think secret die-rolling on the GM's part made it so we didn't know the monster's THAC0 or damage dice, only that it had seemingly one-shotted a fighter.)<br/><br/>The rest of the group prevailed, and we just knuckled down, took a few hits and rolled over the monster.  My "sensible" tactic was an ingredient from the wrong type of story.<br/><br/>There's a part of me that (perhaps unfairly, and despite the fact that I really like it) sees a kind of self-deluded machismo at work in the old school wargaming aesthetic's assessment of how 'common sense' it is. A pejorative way to capture this judgement of mine might be, "Real men tell stories about mantlets."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463833/#Comment_463833" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T08:48:10+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  8:48AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's all very sensible - similar questions are central to my philosophizing about this sort of game as well.<br/><br/>My core theory about what is supposed to be going on in a game like this skill-wise is that it's a communal effort towards cohesive armchair understanding of various forces that reign in dynamic systems. The game is not actually realistic because Gary Gygax wrote such amazingly realistic rules (he didn't), or because the GM is such an expert on medieval warfare (he isn't); rather, the game is realistic in the sense that the procedure the players use for determining what happens is one that should, given patience and earnest effort, help them understand how things work and why plans succeed or fail. The process of play is a truth-discovering one, not truth-obscuring.<br/><br/>Obviously the outcomes are more or less realistic depending on where the play group collectively and individually is in their engagement with wargaming; beginners probably won't achieve as deep, complex or precise simulation as players with more knowledge of the issues and skill with the gaming procedures. Still, even beginner play of this type of game should feature cohesive striving towards realistic outcomes, rather than mere genre-based conventional thinking. I think that this kind of play is more about the journey than the destination, and everything will work out in the long run even if the players do not start from a position of absolutely unassailable expertise. The play process enforces this.<br/><br/>For example, the reason for why mantlets work against zombies at the local tables here is not some sort of gestalt judgement made by the GM. Rather, it's an idea that we've tested through a process of truth-seeking where somebody first invented the idea, and then after that numerous groups and GMs have attempted to establish various reasoned arguments against it, so as to circumscribe the limits of how much you can get away with by simply shouting "Mantlets!" at various problems. Establishing this tactical idea as something that "works" in the game has required players to work out, to the satisfaction of the groups in question, details such as the following:<br/><b>*</b> Does your character have the cultural background to conceptualize and invent the item in question, and even an inkling of appropriate tactics for using it? If not, are we engaging in unrealistic metaplaying by introducing this idea in this campaign context? Where does our mantlet come from, diegetically speaking?<br/><b>*</b> What are the construction materials, and is there sufficient crafting skill in the party for managing to build a mantlet? How much wood, leather, rope and metal does your design require, precisely? How much time, work and money?<br/><b>*</b> How much does this mantlet weight? Precisely how encumbering it is for a character while dungeoneering?<br/><b>*</b> Given that you've managed to bring the mantlet with you to a dungeon combat encounter, how do you use it as part of your combat tactics? What if the enemy simply goes around it? What if the enemy does not approach it? What if the enemy tries to push it down, or pull it down? Do you even have the time and the mental wherewithal to worry about the mantlet in the heat of battle? Do you have the extra men and discipline to form mantlet crews to keep the mantlets upright?<br/><b>*</b> Finally, given that everything else has been dealt with, how much of a stochastic advantage should the presence of the mantlet give you in combat dicing? It turns a generic melee into something of a siege situation. Should you get a hefty AC bonus, or should certain types of enemies be simply unable to attack you as long as the mantlet prevents their approach to range? Should you get an attack bonus or penalty yourself, being somewhat limited by the mantlet as well?<br/><br/>All of the above questions, and more, have been considered and investigated as part of the process of play, multiple times, under several GMs. There is no pre-conceived notion that mantlets "should" work - there cannot be, because I at least hadn't even considered them before Sipi I think suggested them one sunny summer day as the solution to cracking <i>Tomb of the Iron God</i>. The idea that mantlets give X points of circumstance bonus against zombies did not rise full-formed from the brow of some genius, it came about as an inescapable conclusion after we tried to figure out why it wouldn't work, and came up with merely circumstantial reasons. Thorough testing seems to indicate that not only does the mantlet work, but that it's a very good plan with a wide variety of applications once you establish it as part of the tactical doctrine.<br/><br/>(Just about the best reason for why a mantlet shouldn't work against unarmed D&amp;D zombies is that they may be supernaturally strong, and thus capable of e.g. pulling down the mantlet in the right conditions despite facing active resistance. This is not a critical issue, as you can shore up your mantlet in various ways - my personal favourite is to have a retainer whose specialized job in the combat is to crouch behind the mantlet and keep it upright with their body weight. What <i>is</i> critical is that both intelligent enemies and small verminous enemies beat mantlets in various ways, and thus mantlets alone are not sufficient to "solve" low-level D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>I could totally see the kind of play culture that you postulate, where the players simply have different aesthetic sensibilities and a strong conviction that their aesthetics are somehow superior to more conventional ones. In fact, the "grim and gritty" fantasy aesthetic isn't even that dissimilar in this regard - a big part of the charm seems to be a belief that it's a more realistic depiction of the world as it essentially is. There's more going on in wargamey D&amp;D than that, though, as the decision-making about what we do and whether it works isn't aesthetic; it tries to be more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463842/#Comment_463842" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T14:02:05+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  2:02PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the considered reply, that's very useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463856/#Comment_463856" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T01:04:17+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  1:04AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Not to say you should run a simpler game, but for me this makes really important the presence of such tactical manual, since for players to amass this amount of basic knowledge would need several sessions of trial an error.<br/> </p></div></blockquote>\nThe way I look at it, that's not a problem. Rather, that's <i>the whole point of this kind of play</i>.<br/><br/>From that perspective alone, I wouldn't want to bring my players such a "guide" - in a certain way, it reduces the variety of adventures and situations you might see. (Although I could see an argument to the contrary, as well.)<br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>While I see where you're coming from, isn't part of the kind of tactic you're describing in your hypothetical "manual" heavily dependent on the kind of group, GM, and style you're playing in?<br/><br/>I mean, a lot of what you're describing depends on the GM (and/or the group) to rule consistently in certain ways - in other words, to agree together that a certain tactic or strategy is actually worthwhile. <br/><br/>And groups or GMs can come to very different conclusions. I could imagine, for instance,<br/>a group which decides that mantlets are not terribly effective, as we can see from their lack of use in human warfare. They assign a small bonus to their use, and/or a high cost, and therefore using them in dungeon crawling becomes a bad strategy in their campaign.<br/><br/>A bit of a stretch of an example, perhaps - I can see this being much more common with questions like "is it feasible to tunnel under a wall built by Orcs?", or "How effective is dropping prone against magically-targeted spells?"<br/><br/>In particular, I wonder about your judgements regarding certain siege tactics, approach to warfare, and the ability to identify certain adventures from their adventure hooks (how do you do that, anyway?). Have you seen this kind of thing become consistent from group to group, and how much of that do you think would play out the same way elsewhere in the world?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463870/#Comment_463870" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T10:43:14+00:00" title="June 12, 2017 10:43AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the consistency of tactics, it seems to me that the only thing underpinning them from group to group is the inquisitive method used to discover truth. Your question, Paul, is no different from asking why would we think that two different courts of law would judge the same case in the same way. The answer is that there is a good chance that two courts would arrive at the same conclusion in most cases, but that obviously they would also disagree on difficult ones.<br/><br/>Note, however, that whether a group would rule for or against mantlets is not nearly as important as the fact that they rule at all: introducing the idea and gaming it through to find out how the group plays it has value even if they somehow would manage to conclude that a mantlet would be useless. I think that a tactical manual written by somebody else for some other campaign could be quite interesting despite the fact that a different group might judge certain issues differently - it would still be a source of ideas and arguments, challenges for the gaming. It is better for the group to have to face the challenge of the mantlet and to discard it, than to never consider the issue at all.<br/><br/>In my personal experience good ideas are relatively consistent from group to group. There are several reasons for this:<br/><b>*</b> If a player has gone over a given idea - e.g. mantlets - in a prior campaign, they're presumably well prepared to argue for it in a new situation as well. Their excitement is contagious, and assuming that they get along with the other players, the others are likely to go along with a well-presented case. The fact that the idea has a champion already committed to it at the table makes it much more likely to pass, obviously.<br/><b>*</b> If an idea passed muster at one table running a high quality wargaming process, then that idea probably has some objective merit to it, which makes it more likely for another table with a similarly rigorous process to pass it as well. The basic precepts of judgement are the same, after all.<br/><b>*</b> While two campaigns well could have different conditions that cause different ideas to be feasible, it's a fact that most of everything is the same from group to group: the game worlds tend to have things like humans, gravity, trees, animate skeletons, 10-feet dungeon corridors, medievalisms... any strategic doctrines that rely on such common precepts are likely to cross over well from campaign to campaign.<br/><br/>Wouldn't you say that those factors are likely to cause a certain degree of cross-compatibility between campaigns? That precisely is my experience: I can talk tactics and strategy meaningfully with players from different campaigns, as long as their game has a genuine strategic environment (that is, they really game out these things instead of just relying on the GM's aesthetic sensibilities or similar to determine what is permissible and what isn't).<br/><br/>If I had to pinpoint reasons for why tactical objectivity <i>wouldn't</i> cross over from campaign to campaign, then I'd place most of the blame on the GM. Particularly, if the GM has an impure method (e.g. they labor under the misconception that their job is to force the game to resemble a Gygaxian campaign, rather than working things out independently), they might well make judgement calls that would not stand well under rigorous examination. This is an avoidable problem, but obviously only if the group is interested in improving in that regard.<br/><br/>Here's a funny cognitive tendency common to many GMs: it is usual for a GM to reward inventive on-the-spot thinking (because they like active players), while discouraging thinking out of the box on a strategic level (because they're afraid of change). This is the aesthetic process that gets you lamp oil problems: a GM delights in it when a desperate party improvises burn bombs out of lamp oil, but then they come to regret their initial call when the adventurers start equipping themselves with carefully constructed oil bombs for every expedition. This may lead to a funny dip in tactical effectiveness, where you got a d8 area effect damage or something similarly ridiculous out of the lamp oil first time around, but later on all sorts of difficulties start to crop up, and the mechanical impact starts to go down, as the GM tries to discourage oil bombs from becoming a standard feature. All very understandable when viewed as a process of fine-tuning the simulation, but if the motivation is simply regret for a mythical "right way to dungeoneer", then we can't really call it a robust wargaming procedure anymore.<br/><br/>I could see a GM judge on the mantlets the same way: when first in a desperate situation you detach a dungeon door and use it as an impromptu shield against enemies it's excellent tactical play and merits a huge mechanical impact, but later when you improve on the idea and start developing actual hardpoint defensive tactics, the GM turns on you simply because they're conservative and don't want to see standard gygaxian tactics change on them. I haven't personally seen mantlets being treated this way, but I imagine that I would be somewhat cross as a player if I witnessed a GM be so flippy-floppy with no good reason.<br/><br/>Those kinds of cognitive leanings are a threat to tactical compatibility between campaigns, I agree, but I do not think that they're an insurmountable issue, any more than similar features of human psychology prevent courts of law from providing a reasonably reliable service. The other players just need to keep an actual hand in the process instead of just letting the GM wallow in the responsibility - keep the GM honest by challenging their reasoning, and they should arrive at something resembling truth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463877/#Comment_463877" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T15:57:53+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  3:57PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent reply, Eero.<br/><br/>I think that, as you say, it's often on the GM's head.

I've never met a Sorcerer GM in real life outside of conventions, for example. I suppose that this kind of D&amp;D is rare in that apparently not many people construe of the game quite in the same way I do - but it also seems like a reliable thing to teach, because I've not lacked people excited to learn and play the game in a wargamey way. To the contrary, it seems like some sort of a missing interpretative lens for many people - D&amp;D starts making sense for the first time and all that.<br/><br/>(And based on Internet writing, I'm not nearly the only ideologue/designer playing the game this way. I may phrase myself in more explicit and stark terms, but the same ideas crop up again and again. The oldest D&amp;D texts are reflective of similar attitudes, too. It's a sort of an undercurrent, even if not nearly the most common way to interpret D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>I should note that I do not think of D&amp;D GMs as "failures" because they do not follow my strange little wargame cult. Everybody plays their own way, and presumably what a given GM does works for them. It would be pretty mean to say that somebody "fails to be properly objective" or "fails to ground their rulings on judicial best practices" or however one might characterize such things, if they were not trying to do anything like that in the first place.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The example of how a GM would reward creative thinking tactically but penalize it strategically is a perfect example of how problems like these crop up.

Once you understand what it is you're supposedly doing, you can check yourself against the theoretical model in everything you do.<br/><b>2)</b> Group participation. Once everybody's on board with what we're trying to do, the group can check each individual player, the GM included, in case they stray.<br/><b>3)</b> Good design. When the game is mechanically in accord with the systemic procedures, and the system supports the creative agenda, it becomes easier to play cohesively than not. At that point, if something feels wrong, it's probably because it <i>is</i> wrong in the big picture.<br/><br/>That whole scenario of a GM making decisions based on emotional expectations of game fun is sort of foreign to me in practice in that I stopped doing "hull-patching" GMing in the mid-'00s already. I mean the kind of GMing where you observe the moment-to-moment game state and use fiat actions to try to steer the game to the right direction. The ship of the game is sinking, so to speak, and the GM is trying to prevent this by patching the holes as they go. One of the fundaments I picked up at the Forge was to stop that sort of thing and just let the damn ship sink if it's going to - we'll rebuild it and it's going to better next time around. Once you stop responding to emotional impulses like "the players are being really clever and proactive, I'll need to reward their effort" and start following procedure, you get to avoid these kinds of subjectivity pitfalls altogether - or at least, they turn from a crux issue into a well-manageable exception. Don't be an emotional slave to the group's expectations, just accomplish your own role and let the game unfold in its own way. Don't imagine ways to make the game more "fun", but rather talk with the other players if they have some gripes or suggestions for improvement, and see if you can focus the game more towards topics that interest everybody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463883/#Comment_463883" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T18:06:02+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  6:06PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I get the idea that <i>players making the manual</i> is actually part of the fun... but that would be as long as players <i>know</i> that making that manual <i>is part of the fun</i>. I mean, the way to make that manual could have those tons of trial an error that shouldn't be perceived as frustrating. It can be done, it just requires the GM and the players to be on the same page about how often they might die and that while story-logic can be a clue, it isn't necessarily the solution to all the problems. <br/><br/>Eero, perhaps then the aide text given by the GM should me more about the method used to make the manual instead of the actual PC knowledge? I mean, for players used only to ask two or three questions to the GM, look mostly at their character sheet numbers to search for the option with the highest chance of success and then kick doors/push the red button when <i>nothing is happening</i> it's hard to believe that other methods could also be fun and have better results. <br/><br/>Some players are used to have the DM roll for random encounters not when in-game time passes, but when actual game-time passes. It's a practice that penalizes the players for taking their time to discuss and make careful plans. It's like if the kicking-doors player were GMing and is now frustrated because <i>nothing is happening</i> At least in the groups I've played with here it's such a common practice that tacticians won't go as far as to take more than 10 minutes top to make a few questions, make a couple suggestions and develop a single plan for something with the complexity of a full scale siege.<br/><br/>Also, it looks to me that in this gamestyle players can have story-like paced narration (as in something interesting happening at every moment) as long as it isn't always concerned about the external world: the inner world of their characters is as important as well. They don't have to kick the door for the story to advance, they can roleplay, develop and explore their own and each other PC's motivations, doubts, etc while preparing to cross that door, if they are not involved in the tactical process. Let the tacticians have their fun as well!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463891/#Comment_463891" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T21:01:03+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  9:01PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of that makes sense, Eero.<br/><br/>The "failure" I was referring to was, rather than intentional "steering", the effect of that impulse if unconsidered. I know if I'm GMing, I'll be just as excited about some cool plan the PCs developed as they are, so that might lead me to adjudicate it more favorably than otherwise.<br/><br/>WarriorMonk,<br/><br/>I'd say that this kind of game depends VERY heavily on expectations being set out clearly before it starts, and reinforced throughout. <br/><br/>Eero does a really good job of keeping up some playful banter as he plays (much like these threads), which helps a lot. <br/><br/>For instance, consider something like, "You wish to go into the cavern by yourself? Sounds risky, but it's your prerogative in this game to take risks or avoid them, as you think best. If there's something dangerous inside, facing it on your own in this game is likely to lead to death, of course. In that case you'll get to see how easy it is to roll up a new character! (And we'll find an excuse to introduce her into play as quickly as possible, so don't worry about losing time on that.)"<br/><br/>Having some constant dialogue about these concerns at the table really helps with this style of play. (In contrast, I can see it being dramatically traumatic... potentially disastrous... with a bunch of "we only talk in-character!" thespians or a GM who tries to "maintain the illusion" constantly.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463895/#Comment_463895" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T21:36:38+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  9:36PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is something we probably should emphasize more when describing our own playstyles and solutions.

Solid.<br/><br/>I've gotten into the habit as a player to incorporate the adventurer party as a company, which tends to formalize new inductions in somewhat useful ways in addition to handling logistics much better than people would do it by themselves. It's also an useful short-term goal for a new character to get a chance to buy into the company (as opposed to having a hireling position), which requires proving oneself on a successful expedition.<br/><br/>Aside from the robber-capitalist paradigm, military simile is also obvious in adventuring parties - a permanent leader of the party tends to turn into a "captain" sooner or later.<br/><br/>Whether a given adventuring party is more like a corporation or a military unit (or a circus, as the case may be), it is favourable to pair newbies up with more experienced adventurers - in truth it's useful to pair everybody up if you can, but the newbies in particular benefit from sitting next to somebody who knows what they're doing.<br/><br/>These types of intra-party social constructions help orient new players, as the natural urge towards character roleplay is directed in an useful way when we establish hierarchical in-character roles like boss, employee, officer, grunt. The player in the subordinate position is generally better prepped to take in advice and act towards meaningful task completion when compared to an anarchic group where nobody in particular is responsible for acclimatizing the newbies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463999/#Comment_463999" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T02:44:13+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  2:44AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2017 2:44AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking further on the idea of "herd stupidity", I'm going to echo Tod's comments earlier and say that it is a feature of group decision-making in general.<br/><br/>Relevantly to gaming, I've seen it happen with collaborative story-gaming, too: by the time we all agree to settle on an idea for something, chances are good that it wasn't our best idea... sometimes not even close.<br/><br/>(I also think it's entirely possible that this is one of the draws of non-collaborative gaming.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464059/#Comment_464059" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T02:42:30+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  2:42AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/adamwb" rel="nofollow">adamwb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Anyway, this is as far as they ever got to writing a guide, one of two gifts given to the party by a long-retired Dwarf, still quoted (especially by that Dwarf's player, of course): [Fight Club style list]</p></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I've gotten into the habit as a player to incorporate the adventurer party as a company, which tends to formalize new inductions in somewhat useful ways in addition to handling logistics much better than people would do it by themselves.</p></div></blockquote>\nI'm a big fan of this type of in-fiction structure.  If adventuring is a thing that happens in the setting, of course there are going to be some established ways of doing it.  When I run <i>Delve</i> for a group of beginning characters, I never go too long without giving them a chance to cross paths with experienced NPC adventurers, so they have the option to see how the pros do it if they want.  Then, late in the game, when the PC party is successful and known, Adventuring Career Counselors will hunt them down to offer advice and services for money.<br/><br/>I think any fictional thing which players lack a good process for could theoretically be helped by those fictional entities who would logically have a good process for such a thing.  Assuming the GM / designer can concoct a good process, that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464074/#Comment_464074" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T15:34:58+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  3:34PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/adamwb" rel="nofollow">adamwb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Anyway, this is as far as they ever got to writing a guide, one of two gifts given to the party by a long-retired Dwarf, still quoted (especially by that Dwarf's player, of course):<br/><br/><a>How To Survive the Dungeon by Raddoh the Aviator</a><br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThis. Is. Perfect.<br/><br/>I mean, I can totally see as a nice part of any design, offering the players a list of things their group can agree on as objectives and methods, that in turn will give the GM a good idea of what players expect of the adventure, and then offer them back plot/quest hooks geared to what they are looking for.<br/><br/>I mean, if the PCs want to be bounty hunters the objectives and methodology are totally different. If they want to be heroes it's somewhat different than if they want just to make money or explore places. Monster hunters will want to go and face the monsters instead of running from them, in consequence their methodology will be different. Of course, players will want to try a mix of things, maybe it can be limited to one objective and six guidelines they can agree on. For ease of use it can be set like a Fiasco setup, or it can be just written by players considering the advice of the most veteran ones. Perhaps there isn't a need of a complicate guide if the players get some of this methodology straight before going into action.<br/><br/>Though some of this is so generic that perhaps a single list that players can modify for their particular tastes will do.<br/><br/>Also, never split the party.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464081/#Comment_464081" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T16:57:55+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  4:57PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I'm envisioning a totally fascinating old-school game where part of the setup is to establish your "adventuring company", and then roll up its "central tenets".<br/><br/>You have a list of useful guidelines to choose from, but some will be omitted for each group, and perhaps some others might even be contraindicated, giving the group its particular strategic flavour.<br/><br/>"Alright, boys.

I've been thinking about that myself as well, but nothing really emblematic has surfaced. The closest I could get was the time when we armed and equipped a tribe of goblins in a megadungeon, only to have them turn against us, but we never finished the scenario, so it was left up in the air as to whether we could scramble our way out of that particular stupidity. Plus, I don't think that quite qualified - I, among other strategists in the party, thought long and hard about what we were doing, over several weeks, and it wasn't really a democratic stupid-concensus at work at all. At most one could consider that the stupidity of an adventurer who is trying to be too clever by far (a separate kind of stupidity, that).<br/><br/>But, Heikki could remind me of another case earlier in that same campaign (Heikki was GMing this) which totally counts. I had just joined the campaign, going on its second year at that point, I think - this was in I want to say 2014 or something like that. I'd forgotten about this because it sort of wasn't my fault and blah blah because I wasn't on the map yet as to our strategic situation, and thus when it all backfired horribly I didn't really feel the enormity of it as it occurred [grin].<br/><br/>So, we were playing <i>Rahasia</i> here, a TSR classic. This is, I think, one of the highlights of Heikki's DMing career, as the lengthy adventure morphed and devolved in unexpected ways as we went, but Heikki kept an even keel strategically and played the NPCs in a very inventive, life-like and merciless manner that made for a good series of challenges that extended far outside the original scope of the adventure. I have written about a slightly later sequence in that adventure earlier, in fact - <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18460/" rel="nofollow">let me drag that up for those interested...</a> So yeah, it was in the spring of 2013, as we can see from the thread date.<br/><br/>Let's quote a bit from that thread, because I see that I've already written about the event that Heikki reminded me of in there, near the start:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As for the temple and dungeon, it appeared that the local Baron of the town of Roman had garrisoned the temple "so as to prevent pagan gatherings" within. This, combined with the sudden paranoia of the Baron (he'd closed the gates of the town proper) and the strange rumours about the death of his wife, were something of a concern for the party. Fortunately we had a back route inside: as a proper '80s TSR adventure, <i>Rahasia</i> features plentiful arbitrary magic, so there are even secret teleporters that can take you in and out of the dungeons just like that, at the snap of the fingers. Quite eldritch against the otherwise relatively realistic backdrop - very similar to how I swung in my own campaign last year.<br/><br/>Of course the players who actually knew from prior experience that the in-going teleporter was faulty due to hijinks from an earlier excursion did nothing to prevent us relying on it for entry, which led unlucky dice rolls and two high-level characters plastering themselves all over the walls as ugly red paste. So that part didn't go so well. Plucky as we were, we located the under-dungeon jail cells and released a few new player characters to join the party before advancing further <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></p></div></blockquote>\nSo I think that's an excellent example of herd stupidity in action: we chose, for some minor reason of convenience (as far as we knew, anyway - in hindsight the baron's weird actions were a huge deal for the scenario), to use a <i>known faulty teleporter</i> to get to the 2nd level of the dungeon in a slightly "safer" way. Nobody really questioned the plan, it was just something that we were going to do as "a matter of course". (Was my very first session with the group, I learned from that old actual play report, so no wonder I didn't say anything - but I could easily have been there for twenty sessions and still gone for it, the feeling of consensual sleep-walking was that strong at the time.)<br/><br/>To make the hindsight stupidity of this course of action perfectly clear, consider the following points of fact:<br/><b>*</b> Heikki tells me that the malfunctioning teleport failed on a 1/6 per use, in which case he rolled off a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1yX8NSYJAyLZ3JXcEdCa0hBRWs/view" rel="nofollow">Teleport Mishap Table</a> to find out what, precisely would happen.<br/><b>*</b> Fully three characters managed to get a teleport failure out of that table that fateful day. Two were 3rd-level party veterans, while the third was my shitty throw-away character.<br/><b>*</b> In an amazing stroke of bad luck the two 3rd-levelers got '20' on that teleport mishap table as they stepped in together, and both failed their saves - instant death. My worthless character got in separately, and of course saved on his mishap result of '13', which would probably have killed him as well.<br/><b>*</b> Being a 3rd level character in our campaigning style is a huge deal. It takes either exceptional luck or a few dozen sessions of careful <i>and</i> successful play to get there. I've only ever gotten one character to 3rd level myself, and never beyond that. Before that hit the party was practically into the mid-levels, but after that we were collectively back to 1st level, just like that. I am actually impressed by how calmly Peitsa and Taneli (Heikki and I think it was them, anyway) took it when the mains from their character stables were snuffed out like that.<br/><br/>So yes, the dice rolls were somewhat unlucky, but frankly we were asking for it by going into that teleporter. Herd stupidity at its finest, and much worse than a 1st level TPK. Never trust an unquestioned, convenient consensus like that. We should have actually gauged the odds, you can't call that an informed decision when we never even considered the difficulty of getting into the dungeon in the old-fashioned way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464151/#Comment_464151" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-18T19:27:50+00:00" title="June 18, 2017  7:27PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting business, Eero!
