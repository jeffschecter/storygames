(If this were the ptevis roast, I'd now lamely quip something like, "Yes, and somehow Paul let the other people do most of the talking.  How the hell did THAT happen?" :-D )<br/><br/>I had occasion to listen to it *as I was driving through Santa Barbara* on the way back from a weekend in LA to my home base in San Jose.  And I found it to be full of awesome insights and advice on playing the game.  My only regret is that we don't have the full AP recordings of that game, as we do for Paul's run of Polaris.  Anyway, if you've not heard it, it's a great listen, and whets the appetite to play this game in the fullness of its long form.<br/><br/>One thing that I wish had more coverage was the topic of immersion in games which use conflict resolution.  Christina mentioned that she had some trouble immersing into her character early on, but this problem "went away" eventually.  How did this happen?  Did she talk about it, and the did the group adjust its play somehow?  Did she just get used to something -- and if so, what?  Interesting topic, that...<br/><br/>-Jason                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
