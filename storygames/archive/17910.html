The former you probably know (The Shadow of Yesterday, etc.), the latter is basically rules-free conspiracy horror.<br/><br/>The thing I enjoy about Solar System is that it's got all the modern tools in a flexible universal framework. This means that we can invent our own, ambitious game setting and apply the system to it. There's creative danger to this, you don't know how things are going to fall out in advance. I imagine that GURPS-players get similar support out of their chosen system, although of course the specific utility is quite different.<br/><br/>The thing I enjoy about Delta Green is that it's a very serious and elaborate setting. The systemic background is deeply problematic for me, but I enjoy wrestling with that as well; what we've been doing in practice is reinventing the Call of Cthulhu system to make it focus in the right ways for the game. It's a process of game development via play.<br/><br/>Looking at this pair, it seems that I spend quite a bit of my roleplaying time in various campaigns that exist at least partially for the purpose of investigative, creative work. Even Solar System, which I play basically for fun at this stage, is predicated on exploration of formerly unknown mechanical and fluff territories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405294/#Comment_405294" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-02T11:30:34+00:00" title="February  2, 2013 11:30AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel is a long form game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405296/#Comment_405296" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-02T11:47:30+00:00" title="February  2, 2013 11:47AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah - actually D&amp;D is a bit more long-form in terms of its mechanics than games like Delta Green/Call of Cthulhu, where you probably are doing the same things late in the campaign, just doing it better/more effectively/faster/under worse circumstances.  In D&amp;D you will be flying and laser beaming dudes.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel and Burning Empires both have similar long-term mechanics that really change things up.  I would add Houses of the Blooded and Blood and Honor (the second one is better/clearer but both are good.)<br/><br/>It's interesting: games like FATE and Smallville support long term play by having a very "in the moment" character sheet. Your character is expected/encouraged to <i>change</i> over a long period, and (virtually) all advancement is tied to that. You won't be playing the same <i>character</i> in Smallville after a year of play, in the sense of "character" meaning beliefs, values, relationships, etc. - you just can't do it, it's not mechanically possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405308/#Comment_405308" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-02T20:08:19+00:00" title="February  2, 2013  8:08PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Technoir really gets interesting when you introduce the 2nd or 3rd City to your story...
