                    NPC:  Jessica:  a sweet kid who wants desperately to be friends with ...<br/>
PC:  Cassanda:  An emotionally stunted young girl and mad scientist<br/>
<br/>
Last episode:  Cassandra subjected Jessica to all sorts of terrible things, from deliberately getting her slashed open by a robot ("It hurts ... it hurts so much!") to accidentally blowing up the room she was in.  Jessica was sweet and kind and good, and everybody loved her, and Cassandra was just heinous to her.  When Jessica yelled at Cassandra "You're AWFUL!" it was like judgment from on high.  Cassandra really <b>was</b> awful.  She's a bad person.<br/>
<br/>
This episode:  Cassandra wants to Make It Up to Jessica, somehow.  This is complicated by the fact that Jessica (being ultimately sweet) starts out the game by apologizing to Cassandra.  "I'm so sorry I said those hurtful things ... I understand if you don't like me any more, but I'm not giving up.  I'll make it up to you somehow."  Awwwwww.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Cassandra goes on a secret shopping expedition to find The Perfect Gift for Jessica, and befriends Lucrezia (the goth-girl).  See, this whole "helping people" thing is <i>already</i> making her a better person!  She's making friends, just like a normal girl!  Won't Jessica be pleased?  Lucrezia wants Cassandra to be a moody loner so they can both be angsty, alone and misunderstood together, so she tries to dissuade Cassandra from hanging around with a little ray of sunshine like Jessica, but Cassandra will not be swayed.  She'll do what it takes, become whatever she must, in order to do right by Jessica.<br/>
<br/>
Cassandra concludes that they should buy Jessica some clothes ("With colors!  She likes colors!") but Lucrezia points out that they need Jessica present in order to fit them properly, so Cassandra calls Jessica up and demands that she come down to the mall.  Jessica enters the shop walking like one condemned, knowing that it will be a long, hard road back to regaining Cassandra's friendship, but willing to suffer what she must.  What are the first words Sydney has Cassandra say?<br/>
<br/>
"Jessica!  Good, you're here.  I want you to meet my other friend, Lucrezia."<br/>
<br/>
So understandable.  Cassandra was so proud of having a new friend.  And yet, how can Jessica possibly interpret that, but as saying "Look, I don't need you any more, I've already replaced you ... and what's more, I've called you down here to SEE that I've replaced you, because that's how much I dislike you now."<br/>
<br/>
I have played games in which people have practiced cannibalism on unwilling victims before their still-living eyes.  I have taken a penitent young sinner out into the dusty streets and shot him in the face to save a town.  But I genuinely think that is the deepest I have ever seen a character be hurt.  So much worse than death.<br/>
<br/>
You couldn't <b>pay me</b> to be a teenager again.                </div>

                            Tony, that's beautiful. And your last line is exactly, verbatim, what everyone I've described the concept of <b>Misery Bubblegum</b> to has said. I think that mixing this kind of thing with typical-RPG-style character identification is a taste that only a few people care for. (I'm one of them).                        </div>

                            I didn't think Misery Bubblegum when i saw the heading, and after reading the first few lines of your post, i thought only that the game should be called "Mountain Bitch"                        </div>

                            Heh.<br><br>I was playing Cassandra. I can still remember the glowing sense of happiness I felt, identifying closely with my character, when I said the words, "...meet my other friend." I, the real person playing, honestly took a second to realize why Tony's jaw had dropped and his eyes popped, because -- in a highly "meta" game, which is usually criticized as not allowing this kind of thing -- I was utterly into my character.<br><br>Yes, it is horrifically cruel not out of malice, but out of a painfully teenage combination of obliviousness about, and intense interest in, someone else's feelings.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
