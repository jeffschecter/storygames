There were supposed to be four players, but two of them are being a bit crap. <br/><br/>One of the guys is quite reserved while the second is much more proactive about going after beliefs. It's certainly not a huge problem per se as he can really shine when he comes out of himself, and I think I'm throwing more at the quiet player to get him to step up more often, but should I push more or wait for him? Is this a major issue for other 2-player games?<br/><br/>I also found the first session a bit slow and lacking definition. We spent 2-3 sessions getting together talking about setting and situation (the results of which are on the wiki) and while I think we've got a nice tight premise and opening situation, the session seemed a bit vague in terms of direction from my perspective. I don't think I was strong enough in terms of pushing conflict (especially at the monastery) and this may have been a major contribution to my above thoughts.<br/><br/>I think this issue may stem from my difficulty to set up good bangs for first sessions in general. I know the guys set out for me where they want to go, but to be honest I'm not sure how committed the players are to the beliefs they set out. They changed them just before we started recording as well, which may not have helped.<br/><br/>There is also an issue, in my opinion (and after listening to the session again) regarding narrative content, in terms of raising the game from poor descriptive narration and being able to ramp it up to good to very good narration. At times the description and story content seemed a bit forced and, well, dull. Hopefully this will come with time as we all get more used to the rules and they can disappear into the background. Any tips or suggestions? <br/><br/>I'm sure I'll come up with more, and please, constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. I do find that listening to APs does help me focus what I'm doing as GM and that is where the benefit of such recordings can be seen in my opinion.<br/><br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161535/#Comment_161535" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T15:24:00+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  3:24PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi John! Ken here. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving them change Beliefs right before playing is tough! My BW games usually crash because I can't give enough focus to the story as a GM. I've realized that's in large part because I rush from campaign/char burn to game and don't give myself enough time to think hard on every aspect of the character sheets in front of me (it'd take me a week to really think and pour over them).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, losing two people sucks. Are they going to join? Does losing them kinda de-rail the game?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my suggestion: Ask them to commit to their Beliefs now...they can change them later if things are working well. Spend a good week looking at their beliefs and then push them as hard as you can. I always hear Luke's voice in my head, "You believe that? You do? Really? How about now? And now? And now?" Kick them in the ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: Narrative. You feel like your descriptions are dull? You know, you guys are just starting. Go easy on yourself. It takes lots of time for everyone's mental space to come together. Don't worry or strain about it. Try this: For each and every important Noun in your game, try to give it three adjectives. If you get stuck, as the players for help.<br/>\n<br/>\n"It's a tower, dark, tall, and....uh..."<br/>\n"Decrepit?"<br/>\n"No, I was going for weathered."<br/>\n"Weathered? Oh, that's nice.

And we had some really nice sessions full of conflict and full story twists.  Create tension between the characters and give them each scenes that will challenge each of their strengths and weaknesses as players.<br/><br/>I found a few things to be key after playing BW a number of times (and reading the Burning Wheel forums like a sponge):<br/><br/>1. The most important thing on the character sheet are the beliefs and the instincts.  Make sure they are tight when you start play.  But by the same token, they aren't sacrosanct.  A few sessions in, we noticed that both characters each had a belief that wasn't generating them any Artha.  So we talked about it at the table and they changed them on the fly.  Suddenly I had a new tool in my belt to create conflict and they were earning more fate points almost immediately.  The beliefs exist to drive the story forward and earn them Artha to achieve their ends.  Make sure the players know this.  They aren't going to be able to succeed without Artha helping the important rolls.  And they can't get Artha if they don't have clear Beliefs that you can play against.  I think a lot of first-time BW players treat beliefs like some sort of lame backstory because they don't understand how powerful is it.<br/><br/>2. Don't spend too much time "playing" the game before you play it.  One session is sufficient for world and character burning.  Then just start playing.  You don't need to know every detail of the game world.  In fact, it's even better if you let those details come out in play.<br/><br/>3. This is the most important one.  Don't get too attached to your bangs.  I spend less than an hour prepping for each session.  And that is usually sitting in a coffee shop somewhere looking over notes from the last session, especially the ones at the end where I ask the players what they liked and didn't like and what they wanted to see the next session.  In our last campaign, the players were making Circles tests right and left to try and learn about the underground resistance group.  And they were failing most of the rolls.  So given the emnity clause, every session I was getting handed to me another NPC who was going to try and fool with them.  After 3-4 sessions I had a relationship map that looked like a Japanese soap opera.  Every session I would look at that map and write up a few simple 1-2 line bangs to get the session kickstarted.  But the most interesting things happened when the players did something unexpected or the dice fell a certain way and took the story in a totally unforeseen direction.  Probably the best session we had ended up in an awesome DoW with the main adversary.  And only happened because one of the characters got beat to within an inch of his life and the antagonist was the only one who could save him.  Gold!<br/><br/>Don't worry about the descriptive narration.  That will come.  Concentrate on creating opposition based on what is on those character sheets.  <br/><br/>Good luck and go get em!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161604/#Comment_161604" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-09T00:04:49+00:00" title="August  9, 2008 12:04AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2008 12:05AM by John Anderson.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite><br/>Having them change Beliefs right before playing is tough! ...</blockquote>\nWhile one of the guys had good tight beliefs, the second didn't have any beliefs sorted out, despite nagging on my behalf.

I think the session surprised a couple of players who are very new to BW and one commented on the fact that he loved spending the time just brainstorming about the world as they'd never had a session like that before.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>3. ...Don't get too attached to your bangs...</blockquote>\nI really struggled to come up with decent bangs prior to the first sessions play, and to a certain extent just 'winged it'. That first session however really tied things down for me about what the players really want and what the antagonists would or could be doing in reaction. I've managed to spend about 30 minutes coming up with a nice selection of bangs based on what has already transpired. As you say however, they aren't written in stone and I'll need to be conscious of what the players are doing and where they seem to be excited about play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Don't worry about the descriptive narration.
