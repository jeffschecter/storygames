Two of the players do not have much anime experience.  Character generation was a breeze for this rules lite game.  I gave each of the players a 'care package' that contained blank character sheets, and text files of japanese names, example player details, and example goals.  This went a long way towards streamlining the process.  I also used a shared cork board web site to show the 'table seating' via virtual post-it notes.  We went around the table with morning/school prep scenes to get the players familiar with the mechanics.  The first two where a little rough, but by the third and fourth scenes everyone was laughing, cutting up, embellishing and even introducting re-occuring gags.  Everyone's psyched for the next gaming session.  Victory!<br/> <br/><i>InvaderZ</i>: InvaderZ is a totally beer and crisps game targetted at zany one-shot missions.

I remember that 3:16 had rules in place to avoid this (they were basically useless at a lot of things). <br/><br/>What was your feeling?

Quarantine, strange bio-medical readings, debriefings, and more training abound, but that is the life of an extra-dimensional explorer.  My character's wife also ambushed the team with a huge Filipino variety show type event and IDET2 was at the center of it.  Good role playing and almost no dice rolling for this session.<br/><br/>Session two of Panty Explosion Perfect has the girls enduring the gauntlet that is known as lunch.  Talking ravens, bloodthirsty swords, disturbed math teachers, and even more disturbing lunch boxes were present.  The players are really picking up the style differences in the game.  The most difficult thing is keeping the 'table order' of who is the rival and who is the best friend straight.  Skype confuses that a bit with moving the avatars around.<br/><br/>I was in two play test sessions last night of my game chef entry, The Trouble with Rose, and it went awesomely well. Justin and his crew of 20 somethings are pretty much traditional GURPS players. They decided to go with a Wild West theme of love, infidelity, and double crossing. The first few scenes were a little rough while they switched gears from simulation to narrative gaming, but they took to it like a fish to water. They were so psyched that we had to run another game about a near future zombie apocalypse (sorry Shakespeare, I hope you're not spinning too much in your grave.) Much craziness but the funniest part was during the reveal when it turned out that four out of six players were in love with Burning Rose and none of them got the girl!   <br/><br/>Just finished the start of a new game of Zorcerer of Zo via Skype.  The GM is running with the unseeli setting which means things are a bit darker and grimmer than what you might hear on actual play sessions.  It was interesting how the adventurers themselves were also grimmer and darker.  All told, had a lot of fun as we worked to solve a big bad wolf mystery that had a staggering body count.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335879/#Comment_335879" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-24T18:52:41+00:00" title="July 24, 2011  6:52PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtested my Game Chef game, both lots of fun and hugely informative.

It's fantastic to see how different the sessions are depending on what characters are present. Second session was the Maestro'D and Skinner building webs of alliances in the holding, especially a bunch of deals with Rolfball. Third session neither of them were present but the Gunlugger and Faceless didn't have the gravitas to borrow his nightvision goggles and almost ended up killing him for it. The Faceless consults his mask who urges him to kill Rolfball and take his stuff which he does with a mix of stealth and punching through the wall of his giant turtle ranch. Then he burns it down and drags his broken bike all over to lay the blame on the chopper gangs. I wonder what hot characters do when they see that and what they do when they see the Faceless prancing around in his stolen high tech.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335953/#Comment_335953" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-25T10:09:13+00:00" title="July 25, 2011 10:09AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cthulhu Dark<br/><br/>My friend hadn't played an RPG in a long time so I ran something on the fly for her based on some weird internet urban legend that claimed it was "well known" that the Lawrence Research Lab in Berkeley had captured several bigfoots (feet?).
