I got to be Caller last night!<br/><br/>You don't necessarily need to leave by the end of the session, but you need to be able to demonstrate that you have a clear path to the exit.<br/><br/>Our session (exactly 4 hours) consisted mainly of figuring out how to easily and reliably get to and from the Tower regularly, and then we spent 90 minutes extricating ourselves from a nearly-disastrous pit trap. We encountered a single orc, whom we whipped a Sleep on before he saw us, and it was one of the most tense encounters I've had in years.<br/><br/>So far, no 'funny behavior', and I suspect there won't be, due to the stronger nerd tendency to want to one-up each other; that thing John mentioned about getting xp for <i>improving the previous version</i> of the map is a powerful motivator not to fuck around too much. It's pretty amazing, and I am really looking forward to seeing it develop month-to-month.<br/><br/>Supposedly we also get xp based on treasure we find, but only 1/10th standard for combat. So far, we need to take the treasure thing on faith, because we didn't find squat on our expedition. : P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363277/#Comment_363277" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T05:16:45+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  5:16AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the walk home, our friends Sarah and Michelle commented, "I didn't realize there would be so much roleplaying!"

Although the "do this and get XP" is overt, it's still tied to in character action. Our characters have a treasure map that we are drawing in and out of game. Not knowing the details helps us not power game (and there is nothing wrong with power gaming) and rather focus on our emotions, not our rational thinking. The unknown feels scary. Quantifying too much takes some of us out of the fiction (for this specific game).</blockquote>\nIt sounds like Eric is saying you guys receive XP at the end of the session, which means your actions aren't being specifically addressed in play anyway (and, as you point out, they are all character actions, not metagame abstractions).<br/><br/>So what does that look like?

Enormous amounts of pixel-bitching Perception checks and the like. I'd actually prefer fewer skill rolls and more established procedures for simply describing the way we search a room.<br/><br/>But the combination of some tough monsters combined with 1/10th XP for combat really makes the game overall work very well in terms of keeping to the goals. There's little to no reward and much potential badness to be had in fighting; the fact that our characters are made with a modern ruleset means combat encounters are <i>more likely</i> to be at least survivable even if not winnable, but they can still be very tense, especially given how limited things like healing potions, etc, are. It will be really rewarding if we are able to keep playing for a couple of levels and gradually feel some of that pressure ease up.<br/><br/>Regarding the relative opacity of the XP awards: strangely for me, I'm actually pretty okay with it, because I trust the GM to be acting in a Principled (\xe0 la Apocalypse World's Principles and Agenda) manner.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363619/#Comment_363619" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T19:38:49+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  7:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We got:<br/><br/>- 200xp for finding the dungeon<br/>- 300xp for corridors mapped<br/>- 220xp for rooms mapped<br/>- 300xp for notes/directions added to existing maps<br/>- 400xp for traps thwarted<br/>- 270xp for creature threats thwarted (that's NOT just the one you sleeped - he was just worth 13xp)<br/>- 0xp for treasure gained (that would have been 1xp for each 1gp) <br/>- 600xp for making a pit trap into a secret door access to 2nd level which only you know about                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363644/#Comment_363644" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T20:41:48+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  8:41PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff, guys!

What if you *think* you know a way out, but your map is flawed?</blockquote>\nmind you, a lot of this is flying-by-your-pants house rules so much of this is developing as we go.  The two main principles for the game are that they be a: not just monster farming; and b: each session be self contained.  so that you're not wringing your hands about how to deal with player loss from session to session.  So the exit, to this point, has been somewhat handwaved in a quick epilogue in the closing minutes of the session.  For now, we're still all wrangling with the mechanics of getting to the dungeon per session so some of the crunch is still there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363675/#Comment_363675" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T22:24:39+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 10:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 10:30PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, the xp tally got sent to those of us who made this run the following day via e-mail.
