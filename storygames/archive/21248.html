Essentially I held forth that 1st person immersion is a viable style for story games, with the huge advantage that the PCs' desires and goals are what drive the drama and narrative. The other view was that immersion is equally deep in a 3rd person director mode, and that the story emerges best because players put the needs of the story first, while focusing on the desires of their PC.<br/><br/>PC desires focus, approached with different technique.<br/><br/>I almost always approach my PCs from a 1st person immersion approach. Getting into character is one of the things I enjoy when role playing. Yes, acting. "What would I do in this situation?" is key in making decisions for my characters. For me, this is where much of the verisimilitude in a game is created/preserved. On a 50/50 choice I'll go with the dramatic story choice, sure. But sometimes my PC will play it safe, or try to get their way, and that could be at odds with the desires of the other PCs. Sometimes that could be at odds with the desires of the other <i>players</i>.<br/><br/>Does this 1st person immersion approach have a place in all story games? Some story games? In no well-played story games?<br/><br/>Fiasco, which I perceive to be the industry standard, is an interesting case in point. I've played it three times. It has some amazing things in setup that it accomplishes with ease. Characters I've played: a self-serving alpha male who would rather die than appear weak, a youthful keyboardist with artistic aspirations who has just joined a band of old rockers, and a bored London trophy wife with a checkered past. Each of these games had a setting, but no particular direction for the action inherent in the playset. In every case a zany story emerged. 2 of the 3 games evolved into small time burglaries with some characters involved in self-destructive side stories. The 3rd game involved kidnapping, revenge, and attempted extortion. <br/><br/>In all three games my PCs were swept into the action against their will (In 2 of the 3 games my PCs fought back in their own way when that seemed like what they would do.) Is it a fluke that my PCs were swept in each time? Maybe that was a result of approaching the game in 1st person immersion mode. Was it a good or a bad thing? A neutral thing?  Were my fellow players trying to have their PCs lose? Or follow self-destructive goals? Which PCs brought more verisimilitude to the story? Is that even the goal of Fiasco? Was I throwing a wrench in the gears by trying to keep my PC's agency intact? <br/><br/>If I need to provide more details in order to form an opinion, let me know.<br/><br/>Last night's play test involved a Game of Throne's inspired scenario. My opinion is that, in the case of a political intrigue story, the story is best served by players using 1st person immersion and pushing to achieve their ends (rather than focusing on rising action and climax). Plotting and backstabbing ensue. In my opinion the story emerged as PCs tried to "win." But perhaps I perceived that my fellow players were playing as I was when in fact they were using "3rd person immersion." I think that last night the most decisive moments of the story came about when the players were heavily advocating for their PCs--advocating being something we associate more closely with 1st person immersion. But maybe that's just what I thought I saw.<br/><br/>Insights?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465491/#Comment_465491" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T14:41:37+00:00" title="August 11, 2017  2:41PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see why not.

You speak of "immersion", but some of the features you describe, such as "making decisions from the viewpoint of my character" are not exclusive to character immersion - there are other player-character relationships that may be relevant, and probably are. Consider the following list of common relationships that a player can have with their character in roleplaying games:<br/><br/><b>Immersive play:</b> The player primarily focuses on experiencing their character vicariously. When the character is excited, the player is excited, and the player knows that their character is excited by realizing that they are excited themselves, in a certain sort of second-hand manner. The player is not primarily focused on expressing their character of manipulating the story, because they're focused on experiencing their character; the main interaction on the player's part towards the other players is acting as their character.<br/><br/><b>Pawn play:</b> The player utilizes their character as a pawn in the game, that they manipulate to achieve their goal. Often the goal is winning or creating a great story, but it could be something like having your pawn act realistically just as well. The other people's characters are different from your own in that you're the one who has the right to control this pawn, not them.<br/><br/><b>Advocacy play:</b> The player's job is to understand their character as a fictional person, express that personality powerfully to the other players as an audience, and direct the character in making choices according to their best interests. The player's essentially a sort of lawyer or representative who makes sure that their character gets heard as a central character of the game.<br/><br/>(I'm not saying that these names are any better than some other names for this stuff - I'm just giving names to different behaviors so you'll understand my next question.)<br/><br/>So, my question in light of this terminological field is as follows: when you characterize your own play as "1st person immersion", would you say that you're doing "immersive play" or "advocacy play" as per the above terminology? You described your play-style as very focused on your own character, and that it is important to make decisions from the character's viewpoint (as opposed to considering the whole story), but that could conceivably describe either of those two different approaches!<br/><br/>The reason I'm asking is that whether your play style is immersive or advocative changes the answer entirely: while there are a wide variety of games termed "story games" (it's not a strictly defined concept at all), the vast majority of them are not really suited to immersive play in the sense that rpg theory generally understands the term. In the meantime, advocative play is the intended play mode for most story games; the ones where you're supposed to use your character as a pawn to "craft a better story" are overall a clear minority.<br/><br/>In summation: story games do not support actual character immersion well, but they generally expect you to express your character and defend their position zealously. So they're not mostly very immersive in the strong sense of the word, but most <i>are</i> 1s-person games in the sense that they assume that you'll be playing to advocate for your character, not to undermine them.<br/><br/>(If you're wondering, the reason why your average story game doesn't want the players to throw their own characters under the buss is that the game derives most of its drama and tension from the struggles of the protagonist characters, and these struggles are largely expressed by the players while they advocate for their characters. If a player treats their own character as a worthless pawn, the game generally gets colder and the story less interesting; players should like their own characters and have empathy for their travails, so other players would as well, and that way everybody would be engaged by the developing story.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465498/#Comment_465498" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T20:09:23+00:00" title="August 11, 2017  8:09PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>First of all, I think it would be really helpful to sharpen the terminology a bit.

To set up scenes I have to pull out to advocacy play, but still I try to set up scenes as an extension of my PC's off stage actions. Then back into immersive play. When I'm not part of a scene then I experience that scene as a 3rd party commentator.<br/><br/>I consider making story motivated decisions a 3rd person process. Some may call it immersive. For me it is far less/just not immersive. But I don't own the term, people will use it their own way.<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The reason I'm asking is that whether your play style is immersive or advocative changes the answer entirely: while there are a wide variety of games termed "story games" (it's not a strictly defined concept at all), the vast majority of them are not really suited to immersive play in the sense that rpg theory generally understands the term.

For others there may be a lot of going in and out of 1st and 3rd person play. But when I'm immersed I will try to go full bore. I feel that a game like Fiasco does support 1st person immersion as a playing style with benefits, but then I have been accused of playing it wrong and "trying to win." <br/><br/>Playing to achieve what your PC considers a win (could range from super smart to absolutely self-destructive) can drive the events of a story in a good way (or could break the cohesion of the story too, I realize).<br/><br/>I really like what you say about "the reason why your average story game doesn't want the players to throw their own characters under the buss is that the game derives most of its drama and tension from the struggles of the protagonist characters, and these struggles are largely expressed by the players while they advocate for their characters."<br/><br/>I strongly agree with that. And that was the crux of the disagreement with my gaming group: advocate first for your PC or advocate first for the story.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465499/#Comment_465499" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T20:18:30+00:00" title="August 11, 2017  8:18PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2017 10:15PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>I completely agree with your comment. However, I do think there are times when sacrificing your character, if it makes the story very, very good (and satisfies you as a player), is appropriate in a Story Game. Obviously, this would be fairly rare because players must create drama and tension, which is typically done by acting in their characters' interest, (but not always, it can also be done by acting in the story's interest; that is, from what the player thinks will make the best story\u2014it usually is a combination of these two things if the latter is employed, because the former, as you've said, is super important). That said, by sacrificing your character in certain situations you can create a hell of a lot of drama and tension as well. I have a feeling you likely agree with me. If you have a sec let me know your thoughts.

Generally speaking (can't claim that every game works like this) it's very much not what GMless story games try to do, though; even the ones that ask the players to advocate strongly for their characters will usually assume that scene framing is done with the flow of the story in mind, rather than framing "what my character would want to happen".<br/><br/>But anyway, yeah, my personal opinion on this is that most story games are intended and built with the assumption that "GM tasks" are conducted from a "pawn stance" of sorts, so as to facilitate a well-constructed story, while character play is conducted from an advocacy viewpoint: your task is to express your character. The overall goal is to create meaningful stories, often with special emphasis on empathizing with the protagonist.<br/><br/>(An arbitrary example of a game with this structure would be <i>Apocalypse World</i>: the GM is expected to make their choices with dramatic coordination in mind, so as to give the player characters maximum opportunities to engage with the setting and each other in various genre-appropriate situations. Meanwhile, the players are relieve of any and all dramatic requirements except that of running a coherent, interesting dramatic protagonist. One could say that the GM is playing with a pawn-ish relationship to the characters he plays, while the players are advocates for their characters. By default the game does not assume anybody to immerse.)<br/><br/>So I guess that, regarding your discussion with your gaming group, I disagree with both sides: I don't think that character immersion per se is what these kinds of games generally intend or expect, but I don't think that they expect you to disregard the interests of your own character either. What they mostly expect is that you frame scenes and do other GMing tasks to facilitate character showcasing, and that you play your character in a way that is compelling to the audience (which consists of the entire group, of course).<br/><br/>What I expect from these particular foibles (I have some experience with this kind of game, played with different people) is that pawning out (ignoring what your own character wants) leads to artificial and cold storytelling, as the players do not engage with the supposed protagonist; on the other hand, immersion play generally prefers a slower and more passive kind of game participation, which tends to make immersive players less compatible with story games. I can handle both at the gaming table, and they're not nearly the worst sorts of player preferences to have to deal with, but both are slightly problematic if the player is inflexible and unwilling to switch modes where necessary.<br/><br/>The most well-matched player for most story games in my experience is one who is happy to treat the game basically as a show wrestling match: your character is the wrestler, you personally think that they're awesome, and your task is to "put him over" with the audience by being noisy and interesting and cohesive with your gimmicks and the character's story. The character is put into all sorts of dramatic difficulties and struggles during the game for the same reason that wrestlers wrestle, so that the audience gets to vicariously experience those difficulties, triumphs and defeats. A player who understands this will naturally have an advocatory relationship with their character: they show the character strongly to the other players, but they are also fine with waiting for their turn, and they don't mind their character taking a fall if that's the way the game goes - fronting for the character is a task, in service to an engine of drama, the players don't ultimately identify with their characters any more than a manager identifies with a wrestler.<br/><br/>But of course that's just the most general of generalities; not only are particular games different from each other, but many games can also be successfully adapted for different sorts of play. I don't doubt it if you get good results with character immersion in story games, even if that's not quite what most of them are trying to do. I've myself played highly successful sessions with players who strongly prefer to stick to the character perspective in all of their game interactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465502/#Comment_465502" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T22:01:49+00:00" title="August 11, 2017 10:01PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2017 10:04PM by Mongrel_GM.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Huh, doing character motivated scene framing really is hardcore immersionism, I have to say.

My perspective is basically the same as what Eero said here:<br/><br/><i>"I don't think that character immersion per se is what these kinds of games generally intend or expect, but I don't think that they expect you to disregard the interests of your own character either. What they mostly expect is that you frame scenes and do other GMing tasks to facilitate character showcasing, and that you play your character in a way that is compelling to the audience (which consists of the entire group, of course)."<br/></i><br/><br/>The point that I was trying to make is that  people experience immersion in different ways than just from a POV perspective, in the sense that you are talking about. I think that immersion is a very personal thing and that taste can play a role. For example, you tend to get immersed when you are advocating for your character in a way that is akin to how players play their characters in more traditional role playing games (i.e. playing a character and not taking on other GMish duties, like world-building, etc)\u2014perhaps, even playing for your character to win ? Whereas, I can get just as immersed while playing a Story Game in which I am the director and my character at the same time (i.e. while taking on more GM-ish duties)\u2014if fact, I probably get even more immersed playing this way. My point was simply that playing from a POV perspective, understood in "a traditional role playing game" sense, is not the only way to experience immersion or even to maximize it for everyone; we all have different preferences and things that get us into that space. However, I definitely know where you're coming from because I used to experience the exact same thing. One day I just had a perspective shift and it's almost like I get more immersed in collaborative GMless Story Games then in more traditional GMed Games. I do think that taste is a factor.<br/><br/>The other point I was trying to make is that that type of immersion, the POV immersion in that traditional sense, is not a priority for my game <b>Penelope's Loom</b>. I think that since we were talking about these issues in the context of getting feedback about the from the playtest, we may have been misunderstanding each other.  Plus, we have very different tastes and we are both super opinionated and passionate about this stuff, haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>.

It's useful in that while "immersion" is usually understood to be specifically about a deep adoption of a fictional person, "flow" can be anything you focus into so deeply that it becomes effortless and dominates your entire attention. So "immersion" basically one possible type of flow experience, but there are others as well. Many immersion theorists of the old school would say that e.g. Chess cannot have immersion, while it evidently and obviously may have flow experiences for a focused player.<br/><br/>This particular concept became useful in discussions of immersion, as people started arguing about whether you can only immerse in a character - some people reported immersive experiences in setting or even the mechanical process of play, for example. This was sort of a big deal in the traditional Nordic theoretical framework, which tended to privilege immersion quite heavily as a goal and purpose of roleplaying; if you happened to be one of the gamers who wasn't really into deep character identification, co-opting the concept of immersion was important for being able to say that your play also had value - you were also immersed in whatever it was you were doing, it wasn't just shallow posing void of emotional depth.<br/><br/>It used to be part of the standard Forgite theoretical wisdom that "immersion" is just a different name for "I really viscerally like this thing that I'm doing", and therefore not nearly as useful as a theoretical concept as Nordic theory held at the time. As with all things, some people agreed, while others disagreed. The subjective nature of the phenomenon makes it difficult to observe immersion and make theoretical conclusions about it.<br/><br/>Anyway, that came to mind because of how Jeff characterized his excitement at playing a story game as "immersion". As fine a term as any, of course, as long as we aren't terribly committed to figuring out the fine details of the psychology of immersion and whether self-reported immersion experiences really are immersion and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465505/#Comment_465505" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T22:38:02+00:00" title="August 11, 2017 10:38PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2017 10:48PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mongrel said:<br/><i>"I strongly agree with that. And that was the crux of the disagreement with my gaming group: advocate first for your PC or advocate first for the story."</i><br/><br/>You should always play towards what your character wants. But that is different than advocating for them to "win" at the cost of the story. When I say that the story is most important this includes advocating for your characters wants; this is what drives the conflict and tension and "pawning out"  would be horrible for the story. However, if you're advocating for your character at the cost of the story overall, I would say you're not doing it right. If you put the story first, you will typically be playing your character in the right way because doing so is the necessity for the story to be good. However, as I said above, there can be certain times when sacrificing your character for the good of the story is very satisfying, but generally this type of play should be rare and should be implemented after advocating for your player during most of the game and having a good reason to sacrifice your character at a  moment of climax in the later stages of the game (and if it makes the story really, really good). I personally think that people advocate for their characters naturally, and that by stating that the story comes first in a GMless collaborative Story game, it helps to make players share the story, and build upon each other's ideas. Many people are accustomed to playing RPGs to "win" and it's very hard for them to make that perspective shift. Basically, you should both advocate for your character and the story, but people more often forget to advocate for the story, so that is why I use the mantra "story first." Also, in <b>Penelope's Loom</b> telling a good, cohesive story is the main aim of the game. Again, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't advocate for your player, but you also shouldn't make "winning" your main goal.<br/><br/>Mongrel, I kind of think that we're not as far apart as we think we are on this.I think that we might just be talking past each other a bit and misunderstanding one another's positions.

You can read the first paragraph or two of the <i>Zombie Cinema</i> rules to see what I thought was the pedagogically most needful thing to emphasize about the nature of the game. ZC is precisely a vanilla Forgite drama game, as "story game" as they come, so I was trying to encapsulate this exact conversation in those sentences.<br/><br/>It's an intricate tangle, and I've seen designers I respect immensely come down on different sides of the issue. A certain sort of story game - the forgite-style narrativist game - can be constructed to accomodate either character advocacy or looser story priorities, and most of them have quite some flexibility in this regard.<br/><br/>Although I've seen how people forget to respect the story, just as you say, I've also seen the opposite often enough. Adverse phenomena like storyboarding (attempting to pre-plot the game's scenes before they are played) and player collusion (sacrificing genuine dramatic concerns for the sake of perceived group unity) can result.<br/><br/>Much of the pedagogical history of narrativist drama games at the Forge was characterized by trying to teach people these two things at the same time. If you're interested, reading Ron Edwards's narrativism essay might prove enlightening: his theory on the nature of drama - adopted from the playwright Lajos Egri - is basically that empathetic character interest is <i>equivalent</i> to good drama, and therefore your roleplaying should strive to reach a good story <i>through</i> uncompromising character play. This never meant bringing your character's concerns into out-of-character decision-making, and it never meant "wanting to win", but it does mean that, insofar as Ron is correct about the nature of drama, there should never be a genuine reason for your character to act out of character just to "save the story". The story is, according to Egri and Ron, an account of what this protagonistic person does, so anything that forces them to act out of character can only weaken the story.<br/><br/>Of course this sort of drama theory only works if the game accomodates it: player characters need to actually, factually be protagonists of the story in the dramatic sense, and the game needs to pace and coordinate itself in some sensible manner so those characters actually get into position to make story-relevant decisions during play. Still, those sorts of requirements haven't proven so hard to achieve now that we know what to look for in game design, as can be seen by the great number of games that work precisely like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465508/#Comment_465508" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T23:05:38+00:00" title="August 11, 2017 11:05PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2017 11:08PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>With the GMless collaborative Story Game "immersion," I do feel I get more immersed in my characters because my characters typically have so much depth and seem more real and more human.

I think that I've gotten my fill of playing everything and anything with the game (after playing it exhaustively over the last two years), so next I want to write a well thought-out scenario for it that personally interests me, and then play that. I'll probably see about playtesting some of Petteri's ideas for an expansion as well, whenever I get around to it again; there are certain things that could conceivably be developed to expand the game a bit, and I'm curious about whether those will pan out or not.<br/><br/>If you need motivation, by all means read my scenario <a href="http://www.talesofentropy.com/scenarios/doku.php?id=astronaut_school_yggrasil" rel="nofollow">Astronaut School Yggdrasil</a> for the game - won't take long, it's like two pages long and doesn't require any prior study of the rules to understand it. I at least think that it's a fun combination of school anime and classic scifi, and does a pretty good job of showcasing the sort of things the game does. My hypothesis is that you'll read that scenario and then get curious about what sort of game it is precisely that is supposed to be used to play something like that, both expansive and intimate at the same time. That'll then solve your motivation problem [grin].<br/><br/>(Whether something like that seems interesting is of course something of a matter of taste.

Call it getting into character, experiencing the fictional world through my PC, acting. 1st person immersion.<br/><br/>I'm saying that 1st person immersion, focused on character desires, creates tension and drama. I think this can add to and strengthen a story.<br/><br/>I don't propose breaking story, nor giving so much importance to character to the point that story suffers. <br/><br/>I don't want to diminish anyone's enjoyment of immersion in any other part of a game. If they like it, they should reap joy from it.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Winning is a very subjective word. <br/><br/>I think that characters, like real people, will seek to "win." As they do that it will create/augment the emotional verisimilitude of the story. Winning will mean many different things, depending on the character. That could mean: killing your rival and getting away with it, finding that stamp you need for your collection, crushing a rival gang, going on a dream date with that girl in Biology, never being made to look foolish, getting published, ruling the galaxy, becoming the first motorcyclist to jump 40 buses, show up all the other PCs, etc. etc.<br/><br/>If you create a character that must rule all the land in order to win, then that might break the story (or it might not, because it depends on the story). And the seeds of story breakage are actually sown during the setup when you create the character. If you create a character whose main goal is to dump their boyfriend and get a better one, that probably won't spoil the story (or it might, depending on the story).<br/><br/>I would argue that Queen Felicitas in Penelope's Loom was playing to win. I would also argue that she didn't spoil the story in any way. If her part in the story were weak, I would want to know that. If I ruined or diminished the story, I would also want to know that.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Some of the "don't break the story" techniques just come down to game etiquette. And game etiquette is really just a subset of everyday etiquette. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465512/#Comment_465512" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T23:42:48+00:00" title="August 11, 2017 11:42PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>.. his theory on the nature of drama - adopted from the playwright Lajos Egri - is basically that empathetic character interest is <i>equivalent</i> to good drama, and therefore your roleplaying should strive to reach a good story <i>through</i> uncompromising character play.

The story is, according to Egri and Ron, an account of what this protagonistic person does, so anything that forces them to act out of character can only weaken the story.<br/><br/>Of course this sort of drama theory only works if the game accomodates it: player characters need to actually, factually be protagonists of the story in the dramatic sense, and the game needs to pace and coordinate itself in some sensible manner so those characters actually get into position to make story-relevant decisions during play.</p></div></blockquote>\nAgree.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465513/#Comment_465513" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-11T23:43:37+00:00" title="August 11, 2017 11:43PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way to throw a rope over the divide is to ask the currently-active character - using the Character's name, not the Player's - "What do you want to see/have happen?" ...and use their answer as the basis for the resolution of an action attempt.

They want their characters to win and are attached to them and it doesn't matter how it affects the story.  It may not always be as blatant as I'm describing, but it happens to a lesser degree all the time. Especially, when folks are switching over from traditional role playing games to GMless, collaborative Story Games, and aren't accustomed to the different style of play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465519/#Comment_465519" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-12T00:04:29+00:00" title="August 12, 2017 12:04AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2017 12:04AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" rel="nofollow">Mongrel_GM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Are other modes of play lesser, or bad, in your opinion?

I think it does nothing for the <i>factual details</i> of the story beyond what other sorts of advocacy accomplish.  If you want a story that organically sounds like a cool story afterward, without a ton of editing, I think character-immersed play is an incredibly inefficient way to get there.  If you want a story that might sound aimless to others afterward but gets your heart pounding in the moment, on the other hand, then I think 1st person immersion is an <i>excellent</i> way to get <i>that</i>.<br/><br/>I think most RPGs function most reliably when striking a balance.  Story games balance character-immersed play with screenwriting, challenge games (e.g. some takes on some versions of D&amp;D) balance character-immersed play with winning, etc.<br/><br/>Within whatever balance you play with, your position toward or away from 1st person immersion as a priority is basically a matter of taste.<br/><br/>I have pretty strong tastes in this regard, so I do my best to seek out others who feel similarly so we can enjoy it together.

Realistically, though, we have to be able to transition back and forth from the "real world" to the fiction we are creating, there and back again.<br/><br/>Being able and willing to "switch modes", in a principled way, is what makes that work reliably and makes people fun and interesting to play with.<br/><br/>Having a sense of what your game is all about, what the people playing it came here for, and so forth, is what makes game-playing functional - a sense of your creative goals for the activity. A principled approach to getting to do what we're trying to do, and being able to switch stances, tools, or perspectives as needed as you play, is the key to functional gaming.<br/><br/>As I read through this thread, I find myself disagreeing with many of the statements being posted.

However, there are definitely areas of play and design where the opposite will be quite true. It depends on the game being played, how it's being played, and what our goals are.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's a specific scene which would benefit from a player approaching it with full competitive spirit, just for that moment; other times it's a entire game which we design with full-on competition as a goal.<br/><br/>With most story games and most groups, sure - you're not here to win, absolutely true. But taken as an absolute statement, we limit ourselves and players and designers.<br/><br/>Have a sense of your creative goals and approach them in a principled way; have the flexibility to step in and out of different stances as the game progresses.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>[...] both are slightly problematic if the player is inflexible and unwilling to switch modes where necessary.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nIndeed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465528/#Comment_465528" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-12T00:38:42+00:00" title="August 12, 2017 12:38AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2017 12:46AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a><br/>Just to clarify, I'm saying that a player shouldn't try to win in the context of the game we're talking about, which is a collaborative, GMless Story Game, in which it isn't the aim of the game. When we had our discussion we had just played and I was getting feedback about my game <b>Penelope's Loom</b>, so that is the type of game we are talking about. We should've clarified that. In a competitive game, which is created and designed for the players to compete, in which the aim is for the players to "win," I completely agree with what you said.

I'm actually working on a competitive game rule to drive some of the aims of PL, which the group thought would work best as procedures. So it definitely has merit in the games that  use it in their designed to achieve their aims, and has a lot of creative utility when it comes to designing games. I don't see it as a prime directive,  except for in specific circumstances with specific games. If it's reading that way it's probably because a lot of the context has been lost, being that we are having a discussion online about a discussion that happened at Story Games SLC offline, without the history or caveats of that offline discussion. I'll make sure I qualify the stuff I say so it is more clearly understood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465552/#Comment_465552" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-12T14:43:14+00:00" title="August 12, 2017  2:43PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2017 12:07AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" rel="nofollow">Mongrel_GM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>At this point I take it that I can pretty much keep doing what I was doing with impunity (and now with at least marginal ratification, too!)<br/><br/>So I'll keep 1st person immersing and keep modifying (tweaking) my play style as needed from game to game and moment to moment.

Did you feel like I or someone else was being critical of your play-style or how you play the game? If so, that was certainly not intended. I  definitely don't have an issue with how you play the games we play. I think the way you play is awesome and I love the characters you come up with and the way they interact with the story.

Things are probably going to end badly for that PC, he/she is not going to "beat" the other PCs. <br/><br/>It also follows that for the fellow players at a table it could be indistinguishable which play style the tragic PC's player uses. 1st person immersive, and trying to reach their unwise goal? Advocating and thinking more in 3rd person terms to direct the PC towards a tragic end?<br/><br/>It may all come down to player skill. If the tragedy contributes to the group story, the fellow players may never know what the process/style was in the head of the tragic PC's player. <br/><br/>So to answer your question, yes! It is about my mental process as I engage in 1st person immersion. The more I am able to engage in dialogue, interact with other PCs, get the cadence and style of speech down until it feels natural (not usually 2nd nature in one-shots alas)--as I get to that point, the PC starts feeling like a real person. I don't have to ask as frequently "what would my PC do next?" because I just kind of know what I'll do next. And if I don't know, it's because my PC is troubled/confused and he/she doesn't know what to do next. For me it's a great source of verisimilitude.<br/><br/>I don't know if we need to distinguish between the two styles if we already know what works best for each of us personally. I guess it is something that newer gamers might ask about. I guess I would teach by going through examples of approaching game play with either style. <br/><br/>But really it's so "inside one's head" that as far as day-to-day game play goes, only each player will distinguish in their own head what they are doing. If the results are good, the other players at the table reap the rewards.<br/><br/>Thanks for the questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465567/#Comment_465567" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-13T01:45:26+00:00" title="August 13, 2017  1:45AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2017 1:49AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good clarification, Mongrel.

Plus, it certainly wouldn't be fun to play a character like that. This is all kind of obvious though, I don't know how anyone could argue with it.

In my experience the external signs are always there, though.

And the magic is, they are all good ways. Whatever works...works!<br/><br/>Maybe I witnessed a fluke, but in my gaming group players have a blast with Fiasco, and many of those players express their PC's emotions/actions in a fairly narrative style. If I'm interpreting correctly, then I've seen multiple examples of people enjoying Fiasco without doing much 1st person immersing.<br/><br/>Am I correct in interpreting your use of the word "filler" to mean that if a game doesn't have a good way of creating and engaging in the story <i>for you</i> then you might have to fall back on a technique which doesn't hold much interest <i>for you</i>? Or is it an assessment on objective relative merit of game play approach? Or other? Filler is often used to indicate "lacking substance", "not nutritious", "cheap fodder", "the part of the program where none of the funny lines were", etc.<br/><br/>I'm sure I've critiqued games on the level of "it didn't work for me" but couched the critique in terms of "the game had too many complex parts to coordinate", or "not an elegant system". Yup, Montsegur 1244. But maybe it just didn't work <i>for me</i>. And meanwhile other people appreciate the genius and might love the game. (I still felt that the mechanics weren't streamlined, and man did that game absolutely need a map of the chateau rather than a big paragraph describing the physical setting.)<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>I started this thread because on Thursday I was getting the feeling that many story game folks have this viewpoint: that 1st person immersion and putting PC desires foremost is "doing it wrong" or a "less good way of playing." I'm appreciating every post that instead echos this: PC desires are super important, no matter your approach/technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465587/#Comment_465587" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-13T23:55:29+00:00" title="August 13, 2017 11:55PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense to me, too, although I'd be leery of any absolute statements in a context like this.<br/><br/>Can "first person immersion" be a worse way of playing?

I only played that game once, and it crashed half-way, but I can see a clear formula for creating immersion, which means that the game isn't about creating a story but immersion in characters.<br/><br/>If reading Ari-Pekka Lappi's article <i>The Character Interpretation: The Process Before the Immersion and the Game</i> in the Nordic LARP book <a>Beyond Role and Play</a>, you can see that formula. It's heavily based on Bernard Perron's Heuristic Circle of Gameplay, and flow is basically achieved in the same way (hence me writing that flow and immersion are the same thing but with different tools).<br/><br/>So immersion isn't a filler in that game. It's the agenda for said game.\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>(A lot of jargon barfing in this post. :P )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465597/#Comment_465597" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-14T06:47:26+00:00" title="August 14, 2017  6:47AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this is relevant but I sense the same thing here as what theater talk about, Brecht (play a character) vs Stanislavsky (<i>be</i> a character - method acting).<br/><br/>Here is an article about <i>Improv</i> that can be relevant too.
