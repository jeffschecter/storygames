Although she hasn't been interested in RPGs in the past, I really wanted to try it once with her so she could see what this crazy hobby is all about, and because I wanted to share something that is special to me with her. So, the other day I asked her if she'd like to try gaming once, pitching it as one avenue of language practice. For some odd reason it was really hard to get the courage to ask, but surprisingly she said yes!<br/><br/>I thought I'd start a thread to share how things went. I'll break it down into 2-3 posts here to keep things digestible. If you have questions in between fire away, but I may defer answers to some things until I'm done posting all three entries.<br/><br/><b>System Prep:</b><br/><br/>So, we talked briefly about a basic genre and settled on a fantasy story about thieves, probably due to all the hours I spent ignoring her and playing Thief: the Dark Project on the PC years ago. With that to work with, I needed to decide on a system and do make some resources for us to draw on during play that wouldn't overwhelm her.<br/><br/>Ghost/Echo has been on my mind a lot lately, and I've been wanting to try out Otherkind Dice since seeing it. In addition, the "your mission was blown and you're on the run" starting scenario translates well into a fantasy thief type setting, so I filed off the serial numbers and made something called "Night in Nan Madol". I'd share the Google Doc, but honestly the only thing different about it from Ghost/Echo was the color, the fact that I used FUDGE dice instead of D6s, and some setup techniques, so there's not much to share. Basically I came to the table with some simple Ghost/Echo-like rules we would occasionaly refer to, a simple character sheet, a simple city sheet, a list of names and places for both of us to draw from, and a loose explanation about the starting situation.<br/><br/><b>Pre-Game Talk:</b><br/><br/>We talked briefly about the basic roles of GM and player in the game. I tend to say what happens in the world, and what other people do, while you tend to say what your character does, but there is a lot of give and take and we should both be open to suggestions from the other person. She had a question or two about how things usually progress in a game, and I expanded on her options during conversation - asking for more details, saying what you want to try, making suggestions for the fiction, and so on. I had a list of phrases prepared, but we never really needed them after we got rolling. Finally, I explained the conflict system and gave some examples, which she understood pretty readily.<br/><br/>I also gave the disclaimer that few games really reach their full potential in one session, and that unless she *really* didn't like it that we should probably play at least once more after the opening setup and scenario and see if we wanted to go on from there. She agreed.<br/><br/>So, no pressure at all, just me as representative of my entire hobby to this tabula rasa non-gamer, who also happens to be my wife. No pressure at all....gulp.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the game!<br/><br/><b>City Making:</b><br/><br/>I wanted my wife to be invested in the creation of the city as well as her character. I felt this was important since she'd be struggling with language from time to time, and having had some part in creating the city would make it easier for her to imagine the things and places I described.<br/><br/>All we knew at the start was that the city was called Nan Madol, and that it was the biggest city in the world. To expand on that, we went back and forth listing adjectives that might describe the city. We listed 12 altogether, and then I had her choose 3 to describe Nan Madol.<br/><br/>So, Nan Madol is...<br/>The biggest city in the world<br/>Dark<br/>Labyrinthine<br/>Holy<br/><br/>It's amazing how much 3 adjectives can tell you about a place - gears were already turning for <b>both</b> of us at this point. The next step I had in mind was to pick a building to put on the map in the middle of the city as a kind of anchor for the story. The perfect candidate was already on the prepared list. I crossed off "Ruins of the Red Church" and set it in place. After all, Nan Madol is a <i>holy</i> city. Crawling with thieves and partially in ruin, but still holy.<br/><br/>Here's the map as it was by the end of the evening. There are some buildings on there that came up during play - we'll get to that. Also, if I'm going to pretend to be an artist I really need to work on my map illustrating skills, but here you go...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3430/3722234775_33d8d1f715.jpg"/><br/><br/>It's a shared sheet, out on the table between us along with the name and place lists. We'll add more buildings and landmarks on the map and adjectives and facts in the left column as we go.<br/><br/>Next...Character Making, or "The Awesome Begins"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jlcsusara" title="jlcsusara"><img alt="jlcsusara" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jlcsusara">jlcsusara</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218378/#Comment_218378" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T00:49:53+00:00" title="July 15, 2009 12:49AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            great start! i wanna see whats next. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218404/#Comment_218404" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T06:23:13+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  6:23AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great, Colin!

Although half the city lies in ruins, pilgrims from all over the world come to tread the labyrinthine streets and pay obesiance at its many holy sites. Nan Madol can also be very dangerous at night, because there are many thieves. You are one of them.</i><br/><br/>So, I did my opening spiel and we got the city started. Time to make a character.<br/><br/>At this point I explained the opening situation - her character is one of a group of thieves who were trying to steal something when they got sold out by someone in their group. Now separated, they are fleeing pursuit. Again, nothing new for anyone who has read or played Ghost/Echo.<br/><br/>I also explained that, like in a lot of thriller genre movies, we may not know much about the main character or what's going on at the start and that it's ok to figure it out as we go. Still, we need to figure out some basics, so I gave her a simple character sheet and told her we could work out the answers in any order she was comfortable with. Here's what we came up with...<br/><br/><b>Male/Female:</b><br/>Male. We had talked about console RPGs previously and she said always played male characters when she played Dragon Quest, so this wasn't a big surprise. Still, interesting.<br/><br/><b>What are you good at?</b><br/>My Wife (Let's just call her "N" going forward): Umm...<i>[starts to look up the English word in her electronic dictionary]</i><br/>Me: Just tell me the Japanese, or describe it in English, and I'll tell you the word.<br/>N: He's really good with the fukiya<br/>Me: Blowgun!?!<br/>N: Is that OK<br/>Me: <i>[resists the urge to throw the horns and make lightning bolt sounds]</i> Yes, that's great honey.<br/><b><br/>What do you always carry with you?</b><br/>A (special) stone<br/><br/><b>Why are you a thief?</b><br/>N: I want to change the world.<br/>Me: Whoa! OK. So you're not in this for the money.<br/>N: No.<br/>Me: But maybe the other people on your team were?<br/>N: Sure...Can I make some stuff up?<br/>Me: Sure.  We have to agree on it before it becomes real <i>[invokes Lumpley-Care Principle]</i>, but you can always propose things.<br/>N: So, the thing I was trying to steal was the bell of the Red Church <i>[Referring back to the map. Yay!]</i>. There's a legend that anyone who returns it to the Red Church and rings it can change the world, but we don't know if that's for good or evil.<br/>Me: <i>[head asplodes]</i> I love it. Done!<br/><b><br/>What is your name?</b><br/>She made her own rather than pick from the list - yet another of many surprises for the evening.<br/>N: His name is Horizon. It has a special meaning, because the buildings of Nan Madol are very low and flat, but Horizon is always moving around past them.<br/>...aaaand, she's just used character info to evoke another fact about the city. Awesome. We knew it was like a big maze, now we know almost all the buildings are the same height. Religious restriction maybe - "Nothing may obscure the view of the Red Church" - not sure yet. Maybe some of the big structures we'll see on the map later will be taller too. The image is firming up.<br/><br/><b>What's your psychic discipline:</b><br/><i> Again, lifted straight from Ghost/Echo. Horizon and the 4 other thieves on the team each practiced some sort of unique psychic discipline.</i><br/>Teleportation<br/><br/><b>What do you look like?</b><br/>She drew a picture...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3479/3722234603_3fb63290f8.jpg"/><br/><br/>Badass cloak? Check. Face obscured in darkness? Check. Awesome. Just imagine this guy teleporting around you in a maze of streets, sniping at you with his freaking blowgun. Plus, he's going to try to change the world, <i>now</i>. Yes, so yes.<br/>I'm told the crosslike thing at his neck is the symbol of the Labyrinth and is very important, but we don't know why yet.<br/><br/>OK, so we're done with the preliminaries. We've got about an hour left for the night. I am grinning from ear to ear and wondering when the aliens switched my normally serious and straightforward (and very lovable) wife with this insanely imaginitive gamer, and we are ready to send Horizon out into the streets of Nan Madol.<br/><i><br/>Next time - Night in Nan Madol...</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218760/#Comment_218760" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T12:02:03+00:00" title="July 16, 2009 12:02PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Part 3: Night in Nan Madol</b><br/><br/>So all the setup was done and it was time to play. We had about an hour left, enough time to get in a scene or two and set the stage for next time...assuming we didn't fall too flat this time.<br/><br/>I explained real quick that we'd start in media res, like you see in some films. Horizon and his fellow thieves got ambushed by guards and have split up to avoid capture. I decided that the bell is not kept inside the Red Church, otherwise people would be breaking in trying to ring it all the time and change the world.<br/><br/>Instead, it's kept in the bottommost level of the Guardhouse of the Blue Gate, under heavy guard, sealed inside 3 concentric stone shells, each locked with a different key. The bell itself is not that big - it can be carried by one person. I crossed the Guardhouse off of our list and added it to the map. I'm really grooving on using a freeform map like this, as it's something that I've been wanting to try for a while. Just putting stuff down implies all sorts of things - the presence of a wall around the city with the Blue Gate at the North extent, the implied presence of other gates, and so on.<br/><b><br/>Scene 1: Cornered!</b><br/><br/>I framed the first scene with Horizon fleeing some City Guards [who wear metal armor, have huge beards, and carry halberds] and coming to a dead end in an alleyway. "So, what do you do?"<br/><br/>N (the player) was going to set a goal of "Kill the guards with my blowgun", and we had the index cards out with goals and dangers on them, but then she decided to change it to "Teleport away". I figured we hadn't touched dice yet, so we instituted an informal "free and clear" rule where we can both change/add/remove goals and dangers until we're settled and ready to roll, which we did next...<br/><br/><b>Goal:</b> Escape the Guards by Teleporting<br/><b>Danger:</b> You end up somewhere even worse<br/><b>Danger (DMs discretion): </b>The guards wound you<br/><br/>The roll came up +, +, -, with the player choosing to escape the guards unharmed, but ending up somewhere even more unpleasant. So, Horizon manages to pause long enough to focus his mind and engage his discipline of teleportation, but he's lost his bearings while fleeing through the labyrinthine alleys outside the guardhouse and can't fix a destination. Desperate, he jumps anyway...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218772/#Comment_218772" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T12:33:04+00:00" title="July 16, 2009 12:33PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2009 12:50PM by ColinC.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scene 2: What is love?</b><br/><br/>...and appears in a stone room in a tower, filled with all sorts of magical paraphenalia, including a glowing pentagram which he's standing in the middle of. Also in the room is the <b>Witch Warden</b> [crossed off the list], who is a very powerful wizard. He's also really creepy, in that he's traded both his eyes for magical power and sewed his eyelids shut. Yes, Horizon has been brought here by a failed summoning spell. [I've been reading Judd Karlmann's Sammesh the Summoner threads a lot of late]<br/><br/>The Witch Warden looks miffed, as he was expecting a powerful demon. He says something to that effect, then his hands start glowing as he readies himself to "clean up" after his failed attempt.\n<blockquote>Horizon [without missing a beat]: No, I'm not the demon. I was sent by him. What do you want? [The player already gets the "in-character" voice too, which was cool. Horizon sounded kind've familiar - more on that later]<br/><br/>GM: Whoa! So, you're trying to trick him?<br/><br/>Player: Yes<br/><br/>GM: Nice.</blockquote>\nSo, straight into another conflict.<br/><br/><b>Goal:</b> Trick the Witch Warden into helping me<br/><b>Danger:</b> He puts a geas on you<br/><br/>I gave the player an extra die without their prompting - Horizon's deadpan deception was too cool, and he does look like someone a demon might send. Dice came up +,+,0 this time, so Horizon is somehow going to trick the wizard into giving him what he wants, without getting bound to carry out his own half of the bargain. I explain that we should play this out a little bit, which we do in some dialogue where my player surprises me yet again.\n<blockquote>Witch Warden: There is a woman, the daughter of the Mayor, who is said to be the most beautiful woman in the city. Tomorrow night both of us will be attending the Mayor's Ball. You will make her fall in love with me at first sight. [Says the guy who looks like Christopher Lee, with creepy robes on, and no eyes]<br/><br/>Horizon: OK, I will do it, but you have to answer me "What do you think love is?"<br/><br/>GM: [head explodes]<br/>GM/Witch Warden: [opens and closes his mouth, then finally stammers something out about how she'll do everything he asks and serve him in all things. Creep. He's basically a 90yr old magic otaku living in a tower]<br/><br/>Horizon: That is the biggest tragedy in the world. How can I give you what you want if you don't know what love is?<br/><br/>GM: [head explodes again]<br/></blockquote>\nThere was some more back and forth, with the Witch Warden getting upset and off balance by this demon's lackey calling him out on his lack of knowledge. Horizon finally agrees to make the woman love the Witch Warden by the time of the Mayor's Ball, a bargain he won't likely keep, but the Witch Warden is so befuddled by things that he forgets to put a geas on Horizon. Horizon, for the "demon's price", demands the Great Bell of Nan Madol. More back and forth as Horizon want's the Witch Warden to bring it to him, but the Witch Warden doesn't want his hand seen in the theft of something so notable. Finally they agree - the Witch Warden will teleport him into the chamber where the bell is kept, and give him an amulet [Emerald Eye on the character sheet] that will shatter any barrier (once). So, the pentagram flares up and Horizon is teleported to the Bell Chamber beneath the Guard House...<br/><br/>Only to find the shattered remains of the casements and no bell. Someone has gotten in ahead of Horizon and stolen it<b>!<br/><br/>Aaaand, cut!</b><br/><br/>We had burnt up our hour, and that seemed a good place to call it.

My wife had a lot of fun and was definitely interested in continuing. We'll be having a Tuesday game night until we finish up this story, or we get tired of it.<br/><br/>I was really surprised, and shouldn't be, about how naturally she took to this with very little prompting from me. We forget how easy gaming can be sometimes until we play it with someone without too many preconceptions about it. Playing with a first-time gamer was a really refreshing and fun experience for me. It's also *very* nice to know that my wife "gets" my hobby now.<br/><br/>She asked me a really cool question after we were done: "Do people use these games to make novels?", which I struggled with an answer for. I don't like "gamer novels", but I'm thinking what I really don't like is cliched D&amp;D stuff in novel form. This felt more like Fritz Leiber or something. I also mentioned PTA and how it has turned out hundreds of TV show concepts that would work just fine on real TV.<br/><br/>I'm really happy with the Ghost/Echo otherkind-like system for one-on-one games. Having an oracle of names and places really helped too. The map doesn't have a lot of mechanical effect (which is something I'd like to try someday) but it's plenty evocative as it stands.<br/><br/>I kept trying to place what Horizon's voice sounded like - evoked a little bit by my wife's narration and a bit by my own imagination. Last night we were having dinner at IKEA and it finally hit me...\n<blockquote><br/>Me: Hey, about your character. Does he sound like Rorschach from the Watchmen movie we saw?<br/>Her: Are you reading my mind?</blockquote>\nNow Horizon has a voice, and it fits. Awesome.<br/><br/>I'll probably post uber-abbreviated APs after we do this again.

My few experiences of playing rpgs with non-gamers have been universally rewarding.  They are often so creative and uninhibited, their choices blissfully unformed by hundreds of hours of gaming with various systems whether well-designed or ill-suited to their play goals.  But to play a one-on-one game like this with one's non-gamer wife, well... it's just breathtaking.  I'm really looking forward to hearing about the next session.<br/><br/>My partner doesn't play rpgs, but she does play boardgames and computer games with me.  I feel very grateful for that, and this thread is a good reminder.<br/><br/>"That is the biggest tragedy in the world. How can I give you what you want if you don't know what love is?"

I guarantee you next session we'll see the Mayor's daughter show up, who I think is probably about to get stuck in an arranged marriage but really wants to marry for love.<br/><br/>It's amazing how only an hour of play can generate so many story leads. The Witch Warden will not be pleased if the "agent of the demon" doesn't keep up his side of the deal. Someone has stolen the bell. Horizon's partner's in crime are still unaccounted for. <br/><br/>Plus, Horizon himself is a *huge* cipher. We (meaning the non-existent audience) don't really know if him ringing the bell is a good thing or not just yet. I plan to throw a lot of different situations at him to see what kind of guy he is. That way by the end we know what we might expect if he succeeds.<br/><br/>New players have a kind of creative innocence that's almost infectious. You find yourself checking your own actions and asking "Is that really the coolest thing I can do, or am I just playing to type here."

So, I'll just give the highlights this time, and share some observations (and questions) about techniques<br/><b><br/>Pre-Session:</b><br/><br/>I really, really, wish I had had the time and resources to use RPGs as an English teaching tool back when I was teaching unmotivated high school students in Japan. I think there's a lot of potential there.<br/><br/>For example, before I even started to ask "So, what happened last time?", my player starts recounting the events of last session. Past tense, telling about events in order, expanding on things when asked, remembering words from last time - all part of the process. Although, I'm not sure how useful words like "pentagram" and "geas" will be in everyday conversation!<br/><br/>Anyway, recap complete, we are ready to go<br/><br/><b>Scene 1: Fade<br/></b><br/>We picked up right where we left off, with Horizon in the now empty Bell Chamber. The stone shell that used to surround the bell has been smashed, and the doors to the room blown off their hinges. N (the player) wanted Horizon to go straight back to the Witch Warden's tower to talk to him. At this point I explained that sometimes things in the fiction block you from doing exactly what you want to do - in this case Horizon needs to get out of the underground vault, which requires either teleportation or simply sneaking out, both of which are risky. I confess I also had an ulterior motive - I wanted Horizon to run into someone in the "dungeon", which he did.<br/><br/>Sneaking out, he runs into one of his three partners in crime from the failed mission, Fade. She's your average black leather catsuit wearing lady thief, with the power to become nearly invisible. Horizon finds her in a jail cell below the guardhouse, being watched by one of the guards.<br/><br/>At his point we stopped narration because I had some questions for Horizon about past events and the motives of the team members for stealing the bell in the first place. We finally decided that the other thieves didn't know about the bell's power (it's pretty obscure), and that Horizon had them thinking that it was made of gold (it's not) and worth a lot of money (maybe). So, he lied to them. However, someone else on the team sold them out, so he's not the only one with ulterior motives. As they say, no honor among thieves.<br/><br/>Anyway, Horizon decides to try killing the guard and we go to dice. Result: the guard is taken out by Horizon's blowgun, but Fade gets hurt in the struggle - stabbed by the guard.<br/><br/>This was actually a good thing (for me) because I wanted to throw some moral quandries at Horizon to see what kind of person he is. He ends up saving Fade, putting her over his shoulder and making his way out of the dungeon. It seems he's not all bad, although a bit nihilistic as we'll find in Scene 2.<br/><br/><i>Notes:</i><br/>I'm really kicking myself for not having Fade ask Horizon why he saved her. Will have to do that later...<br/>There were probably some little gems in the dialogue Fade and Horizon had on the way out of the dungeon, but I didn't have the presence of mind to write them down. Might be worth recording next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220147/#Comment_220147" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T12:14:38+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 12:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 12:15PM by ColinC.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scene 2: Doctor Mondrian</b>\n<blockquote>Me: Fade will die if she doesn't get some help. What do you do?<br/>N: Do I know a doctor?<br/>Me: Sure, mark his name off the list and tell me about him.<br/>N: His name is Doctor Mondrian [marks list]. He knows both Eastern and Western Medicine, and can treat psychics, which is difficult to do. (Note: N consistently adds extra color when I get her to describe or define things in the fiction. This is a good thing.)<br/>Me: Sounds good! He lives in the Tower Slums [marks list]. So, you get to his door...</blockquote>\nThis scene was basically an extended series of conflicts as negotiations between Horizon and the doctor took their course. The dice almost always come up polar opposites, there were no win-win rolls the whole time.<br/><br/>First Horizon gets the Doctor to treat Fade's injuries, which she does, but the Doctor divines Horizon's true intent for stealing the bell...\n<blockquote>Mondrian: You know damn well that bell's not made of gold. You're going to try to ring it, aren't you? Do you know what will happen?<br/>Horizon: No, I only know that things will change. I'm tired of this world. I don't care about the result, I just want things to be different.<br/>Mondrian: Give me one reason I shouldn't stop you.<br/>Horizon: Aren't you tired of living in a slum?<br/>Mondrian: Yes, but I'm not tired of living!</blockquote>\nThings go downhill from there, with Mondrian deciding that Horizon is probably too dangerous to allow to live and getting ready to shoot him in the chest with a hand crossbow.<br/><br/><b>Which brings up a question</b> - how do NPCs make things happen in a Ghost/Echo-like game like this one? I decided, arbitrarily, that as GM I simply narrate what they do and the end result, with the player having the power to say "Stop!" and rewind to a conflict. I explained this to the player, who naturally said "Stop!" when Mondrian shot Horizon in the chest.<br/><br/>There was some more dealing and rolling, the upshot of which was that Mondrian agrees to help Horizon change the world, but Mondrian gets to be there for it, presumably to stop him if it looks like things  are going to go bad. Mondrian also manages, as insurance, to poison Horizon with a slow-acting poison that only he has the antidote to. (Yes, I was really reaching at this point. We had some narrative floundering and a bit of disconnect this session.)<br/><br/>Horizon is also focused on fulfilling his side of the deal with the Witch Warden - making the mayors daughter fall in love with the guy. He actually manages to convince Mondrian to supply him with a love potion.<br/><br/><b>So, I have a quandry</b> - someone else has obviously stolen the bell, but Horizon is more concerned with making sure and angry Witch Warden doesn't come after him for breaking his side of the bargain. I struggled a bit - should I press with logic and convince the player that the bell is a bigger priority, or just go with the flow. I guess that's another question I have about Ghost/Echo - <i>How much stuff can happen outside the main character's view, not directly determined by the outcome of dice rolls? If Horizon screws around too long, will someone else ring the bell instead?</i><br/><br/>In addition - we really need to nail down exactly what the bell does, or doesn't do. A lot of the decisions Horizon makes are predicated on the idea that the bell will change *everything*, so he feels his actions will ultimately be forgiven, like Neo and Trinity killing all those clock-punching security guards in "The Matrix", but I don't think that's the case. I'm leaning towards the bell changing only *one* thing (like the adjectives we used to describe the city at the start). We'll have to discuss this before next session, or have it be revealed in-game.<br/><br/>Anyway, the upshot of all this is Horizon has a love potion he needs to deliver to the Mayor's daughter. Naturally, it makes her fall in love with the first person she sees. Nothing could possibly go wrong, right? I guess we'll find out next week during Session 3!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220202/#Comment_220202" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T15:45:53+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  3:45PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 4:38PM by nemomeme.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you get to decide how NPCs make actions in Ghost/Echo, especially since you've hacked it further for a very specific audience.  That is the Harper way, no?<br/><br/>re: the Bell<br/><br/>I think you should go with what N/Horizon seems to find important.  But it's also fair to call the chance that someone else rings a bell an extant Danger that Remains.  Put it on a card and put it in front of both of you, with either of you able to include it as a Danger in the future.  I'd probably wait a few conflicts before you yourself start reaching for it.<br/><br/>I also think you should consider the possibility that the Witch Warden and the bell are a part of the same story in some way rather than two necessarily different stories with hierarchical importance.<br/><br/>And even if they aren't connected, one might might be a simple heist story with a mythological conceit, while the other deals with the metaphysical Nature of Love.  Maybe Horizon's got the priority right!  <i>(note to all: The Brothers Bloom is so far the best movie of the year)</i><br/><br/>That the daugher of the Mayor might fall in love with Horizon is an interesting possible Danger.  That he might fall in love with her without the potion is another.  I wonder if there might be an even more interesting one and would think about it carefully before settling on something after seeing now N approaches the situation.<br/><br/>Looks like it's going well and very happy to hear there are more sessions to come!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220204/#Comment_220204" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T15:57:08+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  3:57PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Matthew said.

Nice to know that I arrived at the same method as the original designer, though!<br/><br/>Sounds like both of you are advocating "No Myth" play, which makes total sense to me. So, resolved - cool stuff will happen to Horizon wherever he goes, and apart from certain dangers and some NPCs acting on their motivations very little will go on "backstage".<br/><br/>The concepts of extant and delayed dangers are new ones. I always assumed they were immediate. I'll definitely try them out if I see an opportunity.<br/><br/>Thanks again to both of you for posting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221166/#Comment_221166" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T11:40:41+00:00" title="July 28, 2009 11:40AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just found this.

Anything else you'd like to share about that?</blockquote>\nLet's see...first of all I should say that the educational elements are really just an added benefit - first and foremost we're playing.<br/><br/>The little things I'm doing - having her put away the dictionary, trying to describe things in English if you don't have word, and so on - were learned from 3 years as an assistant language teacher in Japan. A lot of students there go straight to the dictionary and try to construct a perfect sentence before they say anything - thus never getting anything said. It's the polar opposite of my own experiences learning Japanese in college, where you try first, circumlocute or delay if need be, but you try. The teacher might correct you after that, but you'd lose less points for that than you would for looking at your book.<br/><br/>In short, I'm not an educator but I've been exposed to a few techniques that seem to be helpful.<br/><br/>One thing I have noticed, from this and from my own experiences gaming in Japanese is that because RP puts you in all sorts of situations outside of everyday life, it really pushes you to stretch the limits of your language skills. It's easy to ask directions to the store, but how often in everyday life do you get to debate the fate of the world with someone pointing a crossbow at your chest?  Granted, this has limited applications in the real world, but you're doing all sorts of debating, talking about feelings and concepts, and so many other things that you may have never thought of discussing because you're usually so focused on getting basic ideas across.  Add to that the fact that you're in a safe environment for linguistic experimentation and you've got a great opportunity to flex your linguistic muscles a bit.<br/><br/>I hope that answers your question. I'm flattered that someone from as far away as Finland, especially a game designer of your standing, noticed this thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
