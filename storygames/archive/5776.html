I I played two games of it! One was a single session, the other a four-parter. Both were memorable.<br/><br/>Has anyone played the full version of Polaris, which requires at least 13-20 sessions in order for a character to naturally trigger the endgame, rather than jumping ahead, forcing the endgame, or just dipping their toe in in 1-3 sessions?<br/><br/>*two hands go up in the back*<br/><br/>Hmmmm...</blockquote>\nThen Judd said: \n<blockquote>I got to the endgame in one night.<br/><br/>You don't have to make only one experience roll per scene. You can roll MANY experience dice for any given scene.<br/><br/>Now...go play!</blockquote>\nTo which Mike said:\n<blockquote>What Andy is basically saying is that, as designed to run for 14 sessions or whatever, nobody plays that way. Or very rarely. He's infering that there's a reason for this. Yes, you can shorten the game to get to endgame, sure. But is that what the game suggests, or Ben intended?</blockquote>\nAnd in a whisper I said: \n<blockquote>Interesting.<br/><br/>I've often wondered about the ratio of short run games to long run games in the community. I mean, I know a lot of folks like short run games and one shot games. But I also know a lot who like longer run games, and don't always find them available in the indie pool.<br/><br/>It's also occurred to me that one of the reasons for that could be that to make a proper long run game, in the system matters model, you have to repeatedly playtest whole long runs of games. And considering how hard it is to playtest a game for 4 sessions repeatedly, how much time and effort would it take to get multiple groups to play 12+ session games enough to make sure the game works over the long term?<br/><br/>That's gotta be fucking brutal.</blockquote>\nSo now, for this thread I'm gonna say:<br/><br/><br/>I think there is some validity to Andy's point as a criticism of Polaris. <br/><br/>Now, same question, but this time replace "Polaris" with "Dogs in the Vineyard." <br/><br/>I mean, I know more hands will stay up for mid to long runs of Dogs, but from everything that I've seen and heard, short runs and one shots are most common. <br/><br/>Ditto with Sorcerer. Ditto with TSOY. Ditto with.. well...<br/><br/>Hell, how many folks here have played an indie game that goes 12+ sessions? How many have done so more than once? <br/><br/>How many when it wasn't Burning Wheel?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129354/#Comment_129354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T14:48:20+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:48PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We often play 3 or 4 sessions of the same game.

I think this is a sticky issue -- like, we have busy lives, many of us. 12 sessions of 4 hours is brutal to arrange for. <br/><br/>But maybe Polaris doesn't support that kind of play as well as Ben would have liked. (Edit: As you point out -- if that's even for sure what he wanted. I always kinda felt Polaris should be shorter than that. But still, I'd think... 5 to 6 sessions for my ideal.) Maybe the two work together? Maybe one works against the other? <br/><br/>When a game's rules support long play, and you've only got time for a short game in your life, which is going to give? And if you've never played it long, is it because of the rules or because of you?<br/><br/>I mean, its a thing recently to compare game design and social engineering, and I think its a valid thing. But how much of what happens with something like Polaris not getting played 12+ sessions is Polaris, and how much is the community having a preference to not play 12 sessions? <br/><br/>I have a feeling both things are involved. But I'd also like to hear more data about it. Cause who knows, Mike could come on any minute and tell us about his 1000+ session long Hero Quest game, and how he couldn't do that with Polaris.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129370/#Comment_129370" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T15:01:21+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  3:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 3:05PM by Valamir.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm hardcoding Blood Red Sands to take 10 sessions if played to completion.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a data point.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdited to clarify:  10 sessions if you manage to consistently finish a scenario in a single session.

It's a group that tends to build slowly, so we had characters transcend but at a stately, measured pace.  The other group I play in is much more aggressive and there's no way we'd get 12 sessions out of set of characters.

This is because I tend to use the experience list as a "to do" list.<br/><br/>(recently, in our game of Thou Art But A Warrior, I decided to play a good guy, and actually still had some Zeal when the game ended, despite John Harper's best attempts as my Infidel. This is because TABAW has actual endgame conditions, though.)<br/><br/>My original intent with the game was more like 4-6 sessions. It turns out that it isn't always this long. Oh well, lesson learned for next time (Bliss Stage.)<br/><br/>Some people play longer games of Polaris, by insisting that their knights stay good (and, I think, taking longer breaks and having less aggressive Mistaken.) This is fine. It's also in the rules of the game.<br/><br/>Limiting experience to 1 / scene is breaking the rules, but it's totally acceptable if you want longer play with the same characters. If I had thought of it I would have put it in the back of the book under "longer game."<br/><br/>The one thing I have always wanted to see, which has not been done, is the game where people make new characters when their old characters die or become corrupt. In this manner, the game can be played indefinitely.
