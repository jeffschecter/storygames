I neither see a clear monster in there, nor a clear metaphor.  What's the real-world issue, and what's the character's motivation?<br/><br/>I can't see the monster per se because "Secret Nature" and "Odd abilities" are just too vague.  Secret nature and odd abilities compared to <em>what?</em>  A vampire?  A witch?  A ghost?  An infernal?  In a game where almost everyone has a secret nature and you need to work to play a character <em>without</em> odd abilities, they just don't stand out at all.  And the darkest self "You need to remove knowledge from the world" doesn't feel as if it is workable - you need to either try to kill other PCs permanently or remove knowledge, and for such a harsh darkest self the way out takes collusion rather than can happen naturally.  And you can't even ask for help ghost-style.  You're basically trapped until either you've killed most of the other PCs or someone throws you a bone via metagaming.  I'd look at more a paranoia-type darkest self than a vengeance one.<br/><br/>On the other hand I see a fascinating idea in there, based largely on the Secret Nature/I can Explain pairing, and another one based on the Secret Mission.  Both are templates rather than skins, and shining more focus on one part of Monsterhearts - although it probably doesn't need the attention.<br/><br/>When I say templates, you start out by choosing a base skin - and instead of an optional move from your skin, you grab a template move which can only be taken at character creation.  The Secret Nature/I can Explain moves would probably be for a template called <em>Masquerade</em>.  "Your monstrous nature is so frowned on you believe it would risk your life or complete ostracism to reveal it".  Mechanics for Secret Nature are something like "Whenever a PC discovers your true nature, you gain 1XP and they gain +1 Ongoing against you.  When an NPC finds out you gain 1XP while gains a string and may also immediately make a Hard Move.  After someone reaches five advances but before the final session you can choose to come out - and instead of it being an XP move that makes you vulnerable, you hand out a spray of strings (many to NPCs to invite hard moves - it should be a really scary decision) and change the move, and it's done, although the consequences aren't.  It's a pretty explicit "closet" mechanic that can stack on top of any monstrous skin (and now I'm picturing a very twisted Mortal taking it, and needing to keep the fact they have a True Love secret).  Or possibly you turn this move into the basis for the skin.  Hmm... maybe a "Deep One"<br/><br/>The other one, secret mission would be an assimilation metaphor.  But I completely lack the skill or knowledge to do it justice and know that I'm playing with fire by writing a template like that so would probably just go for one of the existing skins that does this job anyway.  Like The Visitor <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And I'm rambling about my own ideas, sorry.  In short I'm getting ideas reading your skin - but it's not clear, punchy, or allegorical enough to really work right now.  And I can't see what it's intended to speak to although can see aspects of humanity that it does speak to.  And I may try and write the Deep One tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverseraph" title="Silverseraph"><img alt="Silverseraph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverseraph">Silverseraph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428968/#Comment_428968" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-01T05:31:16+00:00" title="March  1, 2014  5:31AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for your response.<br/><br/>I have used the skin twice so far in games and both times a player was drawn to it and is enjoying it though I understand not everyone will be so drawn to it.<br/><br/>The core idea in the skin is the "fear of being different". I wanted to make it because I saw a lack of it in the games I had played or seen played. No one was all that afraid of that their nature was going to get out. Perhaps this is because of the subset of players and games I watched but I wanted a skin with that as it's driving goal. Keeping your secret and dealings with the stresses of hiding who you are because it gives others power over you.<br/><br/>In the process it became clear that the skin was working as metaphor/parody (depending on player play style) for the teenage superhero genre of stories. I like this because to me Monsterhearts is just a TV show being played by real people and this is another type of story that can be told.<br/><br/>Indeed the Darkest self is brutal and terrifying but no more so than the werewolf or ghoul (especially one who hungers for flesh). The Outsider is not guided to the same level of mayhem and violence the others must use or even that they must kill,only that the Outsider must isolate themselves again. There is intentionally no mention that a player cannot use \u201cI can explain...\u201d to attempt to achieve this, though that's pinning all your hopes to die rolls that often go wrong and may mean the person has to do something drastic or flee before they do something drastic.<br/><br/>As for it only being able to escape though metagaming, the escape clause has gone through several rewrites due to my own insecurities about the ease of escaping. I have changed the escape clause back to one of the wordings I had previous which makes it "someone truly convinces you they can be trusted".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428979/#Comment_428979" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-01T12:26:52+00:00" title="March  1, 2014 12:26PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  But both Ghoul and Werewolf target those near them and have escape clauses.  The Werewolf just needs to be stood up to by someone they care about.  At that point they will lash out - and then stop.  The ghoul you can run from (or kite the flesh ghoul to the supermarket if all else fails).  The werewolf is actually unlikely to kill another PC directly from darkest self (they just want them brought down or to roll on their backs), and the Ghoul goes for the nearest target so you just need to outrun NPCs most of the time.  The Outsider has to go for the kill because that's the only way to get people to forget.<br/><br/>As I said above, I'd been inspired to make a Deep One skin from what I saw in there - and fear of being seen as different is the central theme.  And looking at it, the darkest self in mine is just as brutal as terrifying - but there's a difference in who you are expected to target.  You go after the community and the authority figures.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a0BJfnwXE5iVouNcVi_dr2GaKG4vCpr5oFkkoZiA2Q0/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a0BJfnwXE5iVouNcVi_dr2GaKG4vCpr5oFkkoZiA2Q0/edit</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428986/#Comment_428986" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-01T15:34:09+00:00" title="March  1, 2014  3:34PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you've identified a great area of "teenage experience" upon which to focus your monster.  You're right that sometimes keeping secrets isn't as big a deal in a MH game as it can be, and it's great that you're creating a skin to address this.  I agree with Neonchameleon, though, that there's just not enough monster in your skin.  It looks too much like Smallville's Clark Kent, and that's a problem because Clark was never a monster.<br/><br/>I also think you've gotten to complicated with "Secret Nature" and it's related moves and subsystems.  I see it as getting in the way of the players and the fiction instead of supporting them.  What PCs can be trusted with your secret and when they can spill the beans should never be dictated by strings and conditions.  Instead, create moves that incentivize and disincentivize such actions--and trusting the fiction to determine who knows the secret and who is trusted without needing to depend on lists and conditions to do so.<br/><br/>I'd also ditch secret mission and rogue agent--I think that the Infernal and Angel handle that space pretty well already, and there's not enough connection to the alien with a secret concept.  Instead, how about something like a power that erases memories (but with a horrible drawback of some sort) and something related to alien abduction/probes/implants?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429000/#Comment_429000" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T03:58:58+00:00" title="March  2, 2014  3:58AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you considered that people can find out your secret really easy with Gaze into the Abyss?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverseraph" title="Silverseraph"><img alt="Silverseraph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverseraph">Silverseraph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429006/#Comment_429006" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T07:48:29+00:00" title="March  2, 2014  7:48AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2014 8:36AM by Silverseraph.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arscott - I will agree that Clark was not a "monster" for most of the Smallville series but there were a few times he was a monster. While he was usually under the influence of Red Kryptonite at the time, those instances show us that he has the ability to be a monster of horrendous power just as horrible as any of the other characters in here. Additionally Superman is the goldenboy of superheroes there are plenty of others that aren't so nice and could be seen a monsters. Again when I look at this skin I don't see Clark Kent I see the selfish self-serving teenage aliens in Roswell, foolishly using their powers to grill cheese sandwiches and getting someone shot for the effort (Which I now see I am not fully representing with my mechanics).<br/><br/>Still I am thinking of changes that could be made to address these points. I can definitely see your points on the restrictions on the PCs. <br/><br/>"Trusted" was originally envisioned because I needed some middle ground for the "I can explain.." and was initially a separate mechanic of marking names on a list but that felt very cumbersome and less intuitive. ((I just realized that I no longer offer trusted from "I can explain" and I have been operating off that faulty logic so it is being removed entirely))<br/><br/>In concept I was thinking more in terms of restricting NPC actions with Trusted and viewed the strings as you ability to convince someone because of some proof you had, however I definitely see your point and I am thinking of restructuring the moves<br/><br/>How about....<br/>"When someones spreads the secret, they may spend a string on a Character/NPC to have that Character/NPC believe. The secret is revealed to them, they get 2 strings, add their name to the list. If no string is spent, the Character/NPC may choose to take the condition Curious/Suspicious as a condition"<br/><br/>Allowing for not only a more organic spread. Additionally this doesn't mean you can't tell someone that "Paul is an Alien... no I mean a REAL ALIEN" and even have the character believe (or not believe) you. the lack of a string being spent simply means the new character doesn't officially get power over the Outsider.<br/><br/>Lastly I totally see that secret Mission and Rogue agent might not be fitting with what I really wanted to encompass and Likely should be replaced, though I'm not certain what to do. A Mind erasure power might be good, or something that lets you look into someone mind and read thoughts or remove/alter them I just not sure what to do with that or what kind of horrible consequences from that kind of violation to bring.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Praion -- The secret isn't any good if it never gets out (Hence why the secret starts out to at least 1 person). Additionally it should be PCs who Gaze into the Abyss. Those PCs use their strings to RP with the Character and/or use it to spread to others who come back to make demands on the Character and then all become targets for anger and rage and conflict.
