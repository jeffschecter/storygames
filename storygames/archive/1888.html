                    I posted about the same thing, in different terms, on RPG.net:<br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=298918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=298918</a><br/><br/>Okay, I'm interested in finding a play-by-post or play-by-email game.<br/>I'm interested in it because it's something I can do for thirty minutes on an idle weeknight. I'm interested in it because I like writing. I'm interested in it because I like the character relationships that develop in pbp.<br/><br/>I have this idea for a perfect game. I'm either looking to find it or create it. First, and prettiest, step is to search for it.<br/>Below are the criteria for the game I want to play.<br/><br/><b>Forum-based </b>(I am open to email, but it is less desirable.)<br/><br/><b>Free-form or a game with mechanics </b>- Either works for me, but if there is a system I don't want it to have dice/chance, and I don't want the system to trip up the story.<br/><br/>Genre: Something between <b>post-apocalyptic</b>, <b>cyberpunk</b>, <b>modern</b>. I want a "gritty", streets level game, with <b>violence, chaos, budding romances</b>, and the stuff you care about coming into crisis a lot. Romanticized, gritty, pre-apocalyptic tragedy.<br/><br/>Stuff I want the game to include: <b>street gangs </b>(think a mix of Necromunda, Mad Max bikers and your typical cyberpunk-y gangs), guns and <b>crazy cyberpunky weapons weapons</b> (like "hyper-cryo-knife" and "FQ-117 Arm Cannon" and "cyber-enhanced power gauntlet"), <b>romantic tension between characters</b> (preferably in an environment/group that is open to having wisps of queer sexual tension in there), <b> occassional gore </b> (I want a game with thugs and razorwire and chainswords and violence as a political tool).<br/><br/>Things I'd be open to: <b> mecha </b> (power-suits, armoured walkers and cyborgs and stuff are all pretty cool. Not ultra cool, but pretty cool), <b>supernatural elements</b> (angels, occultism, psionics, divine protection and general eeriness are all pretty cool), <b> mega corporations and commercial monopolies </b>, <b>katanas</b> (and all the tropes and self-centered bad-assness that accompanies them inevitably).<br/><br/>Things I'm not at all interested in: <b>a laundry list of supernatural beings</b> (12 gothic races! three different magic systems! Vampyres! Wytch Covens!), <b>senseless and boring violence</b> (I want my blood splatters and power weapons to be accompanied by heartbreaking tragedy, damn it!), <b>fanfic universes</b> (I don't want to play something directly set in a TV/Movie/Comic/Anime/Book universe. I am totally cool with playing something "largely inspired by", but I'm not interested in writing shared fanfic, or in getting into authenticity debates), <b>games where posts are regularly 1,000+ words of flowery prose</b> (If the phrase "the skies a dark and tiresome ebony, our tragic hero casually but briskly stepped along the dark and mottled cobblestone walkway, musing about the many colours that a darkened sky can encompass in its awesome expanse" then I'm not interested in reading on) <b> general wankery </b> (I don't like childish people. This includes logic nazis and mods who feel the need to stifle stories with their policing).<br/><br/>So, yeah. Teenage wasteland, cyberpunk, robocops and arm cannons, anarchy and corporate control, young love, chemically enhanced warriors, biker gangs, emotional trial, gang wars, and thinly-veiled gay love stories. Any reccomendations?<br/><br/>If not, I'm seriously going to have to start a forum-based game for this. I really want to play one!                </div>

                            Aaron is right.  RPoL is a nice little play by post site.  I run a DitV game there and play in a very long running D&amp;D game.                        </div>

                            RPoL has a lot of players to draw from, but after trying a bunch of different games, I gave up on it because I found so many of the players and GMs to be incredibly flaky. A lot of them will ditch games without so much as a word, leaving everyone hanging. This happened with just about every game I played there, usually killing them within a matter of a couple weeks. It got very frustrating after awhile, so I took a break from it.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it's got a lot of code to make managing games quite easy.                        </div>

                            Roleplay Online doesn't seem to have what I'm looking for - their contemporary and cyberpunk games are either running on Shadowrun (don't have it, and I'd prefer freeform), are mostly set in fanfic universes, and the one or two that aren't have no active community.<br/><br/>I'd be delighted if someone could prove me wrong by linking me to a game that fits my (rather daunting list of) criteria on RPoL.<br/><br/>I had a whisper from someone who was interested in the same kind of game. If I have one or two more whispers, and don't FIND anything, then I'll definitely create something.                        </div>

If you make a game, I reccomend using Adam Cerling's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.grapevinelarp.com/EndsAndMeans" rel="nofollow">Ends and Means</a> It's  wonderful system that adds to the story instead of taking it away.<br/>
<br/>
I may be a tad bias however; I'm infatuated enough with the system to have re-written my gaming world to work on the system.<br/>
If you're interested in checking that game world, let me know.   It isn't terribly far off from what you seem to be looking for.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, since E-mail and Webboard forms were  the first experiences that I actually had with roleplay, Free form tends to work best.   But, With something like Ends and Means, I could see it being easily adaptable; although perhaps alot easier over teamspeak and transcripted.<br/>
<br/>
My dislike with written forms of roleplay is that they are so time consuming and to me, that is what weighs down games the most!<br/>
<br/>
(p.s...I'm glad to have found out about this place; It is alot more buzzing than Forge!)                        </div>

I realize that in PBP action slows to a grinding halt, there is more characterization than plot, and people often write big posts about how cool they are.<br>And I'm fine with that.<br><br>I want equal amounts of relationship, characterization, cool action, plot, and acting badass.<br><br>I'll check that system out later tonight. Thanks!                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>
