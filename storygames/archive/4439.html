Chosen Keys define the tenor of the game - bloodbath, sweaty romance, etc.</li>\n<li>Abilities are cool things characters can do.  Using Keys allows the player to increase these.  When you get <i>too </i>good, you transcend and leave the game.</li>\n<li>Pools are the things that are important to the way the world works.  Using Keys allows the player to increase these.  A character's investment in a pool is also a sort of flag, but also, more practically, a resource for pushing things that matter to the player.</li>\n</ul>\nSo in play, players do things that engage and excite them, and are rewarded for that.  This engagement defines the sort of story that is going to be told.  Characters grow through reward, and this growth defines the world.  And finally they transcend, which serves as a very satisfying mechanism for keeping the stories quintessentially human.  In practice you invariably get certain kinds of play emerging - very human, relationship-driven play in my experience.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100396/#Comment_100396" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T06:14:03+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  6:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>I guess there's also a third option</blockquote>\nHey Tim: Have you found any "emergent behaviors" with The Mountain Witch (perhaps that popped up in actual play reports or something) that you can analyze or share?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100412/#Comment_100412" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T07:41:23+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  7:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've written about his quite a bit in <a href="http://www.rpg.net/columns/list-column.phtml?colname=physics" rel="nofollow">speculative physics</a> at RPGnet.<br/><br/>It really helps to take a step back and start looking at the emergent behaviors as objects themselves, looking at them as structures that you can put into the design. For that take a look at the Mathematics of Game Design series (8-11), the Language series (17-19), Groups Redux (27), Stacking Up (31), and Maps (47).<br/><br/>Holistic game design - itself an emergent approach to design seems to do very well to produce these same sorts of patterns in the resulting games themselves. For that, take a look at the introductory articles (1-3), the Seeds of Enlightenment example (12-14), the Drift example (23-25).<br/><br/>Another important aspect of emergent behaviors is that these are ultimately based on the <i>people</i> who are playing. Which often means if you want to design for them, you need to at least model how your players will act. I've talked about that as well: first with Desk Juggling (4-5, with Homeworld Project example 6-7) and reprised with more recent theory developments (43-46). <br/><br/>Lastly, one of the most important emergent aspects of game design is how people "fail" to play your game. This is a very difficult problem, but it also lends some opportunities. I've touched on that very briefly (15) and I strongly expect that this is the next real frontier in RPG design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100416/#Comment_100416" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T08:06:13+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  8:06AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blind playtest is both sufficient and necessary for grasping emergent properties.

The problem is that you an say that Design Pattern X will tend to do some particular things. But that's in a vaccuum. Once it's combined with other Design Patterns...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question becomes like saying, "what sort of gas milage willl I get out of this car design?" Well, we can estimate based on things like mass, engine efficiency, drag co-efficients, etc. But in the end, those won't match reality much, and will vary in practice with things like head-winds or tail-winds, road conditions, maintenence, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the only really practical way to discover the actual emergent properties of play is to play your RPG. And if you want to know how it works for others than yourself, have others play it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you've seen the results, you can go back to the drawing board, and retool, if you're not getting the qualities you want. But spending too much time on trying to predict the truely emergent qualities... well that way lie madness. That's not saying you can't get a general idea, or even that you won't on some rare occasions get nearly what you want on the first try. Just that you'll never really know until you test. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100436/#Comment_100436" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T10:01:42+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 10:01AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There see also personal preferences, too.

I am not one of these; I much prefer creating rules that make it hard or cost-ineffective or even impossible (as opposed to forbidden) to get that score above five.

I tend to prefer designs that are "self restraining" than apply "false limits."  These are in quotes because we're designing them and they are all constructs in some way.  <br/><br/>It always bothered me to say "you add this, this and this for your total number" then in the next breath "oh, and you can't get higher than that."  I can't say that I've never designed something like that in, sometimes it's necessary.  But if I can figure out a way around it I will.<br/><br/>So I have a board game that's in playtest right now.  In the rules I wanted to avoid saying "when you get to the end of the draw pile reshuffle."  It didn't fit into the scope and flow of the game.  Instead I have a card that says "this always goes at the bottom of the deck.  It can't be discarded or traded.  When used as an action reshuffle the discards to start a new draw pile."  I can't exactly determine why but it feels cleaner.  It's easier for a group to say "hmmm, lets remove the card and see what happens," maybe creating a new end condition for the game.  Playing with the deck design feels more appropriate than feeling like "the rules don't work so I feel I need to change THEM."<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?  And am I on target thinking it's related?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100456/#Comment_100456" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T11:21:12+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 11:21AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Russell, Shevaun, can you guys clarify what would be useful to you?

See what actually happens.<br/><br/>And here's my piece of advice:  play some German boardgames.  Games like Puerto Rico, Ra, Lord of the Rings (the cooperative game), or Blue Moon.  Many of these games demonstrate design for emergent behavior without the "squishiness" that sometimes characterizes RPG design.  Watch how the rules encourage certain types of behavior without spelling it out.  It's a good exercise.  At least, I've found it helpful.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100480/#Comment_100480" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T11:58:33+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 11:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strategy in general seems to be an emergent property...or maybe I am smoking too much hippy weed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100502/#Comment_100502" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T12:36:24+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 12:36PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2007 12:37PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's accurate. And, given that for a boardgame at least, that it's important to make the overall winning stragegy unknown, this leads to multiple strategies, which means multiple emergent qualities of play for one set of rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I was talking about. The combination of mechanics gets so complex in application that it's unlikely that you're going to be able to predict second-order behaviors (to say nothing of third or deeper cases). In fact, strategies may change over time. I understand that this can be problematic in the one really strategic RPG that I can think of... D&amp;D 3E+. Meaning that players have come up with some really complex or even degenerate strategies over the years that the game has been out. So the behavior changes over time. <br/>\n<br/>\nCf. the Rand studies by John Nash et. al. on the difference between single plays of certain games and iterative play. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you can't hold yourself responsible for understanding every behavior that the game may produce... you can only playtest so long. Your primary responsibility should be that the game - emergent qualities and all - plays well for at least some proportion of the testers, across all of the behaviors it's seen to produce. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in fact, you may never understand the entirity of the potential emergent behaviors that a game might cause. <br/>\n<br/>\nVis a vis what Seth said, the only way to really address learning this in a rigorous fashion, studying games like the German Games, is to learn your Game Theory (no, not RPG Game Theory, the math field): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's only really by using these mathematics that we can even hope to predict the emergent qualities of play. You'll find you've used these principles yourself, if you look closely. I highly recommend that game designers get to understand it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. when I post about Game Theory, I usually subseqently get innundated with requests for me to explain it. Unfortunately I'm only a dabbler myself and don't have the credentials to explain anything but the bare basics. I suggest doing some reading on it, as that may be more productive. That said, if people want to discuss any particular application of Game Theory, I'll be happy to join in (cue the obligatory thread on figuring out a way to use the Prisoner's Dillema in a RPG).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100597/#Comment_100597" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T18:15:56+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  6:15PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually did study game theory fairly extensively in college but it's been a looooooong time.
