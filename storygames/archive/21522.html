Should have i changed something? Instead of the strings i had to give a condition to Rey Ross?<br/><br/>Another question<br/><br/>The backstory of the Vampire says:<br/>Someone once saved your unlife.

If another character acts against a character with a Condition and (in the opinion of the MC and/or group) takes advantage of it, they gain a +1 to their roll.<br/><br/>In your example, I would apply a condition such as 'ineffectual', 'wimp', 'all bark and no bite' or something similar. If another character tries to (for example) Shut Down the character with the Condition and does so by daring them to stand up or shut up, I would class that as giving a +1.<br/><br/>If the character with the 'Wimp' Condition later successfully causes a bully Harm (for example), I would count the Condition as successfully removed.<br/><br/>That's my interpretation, anyhow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470669/#Comment_470669" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-14T23:02:09+00:00" title="March 14, 2018 11:02PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just going by the examples in the book (and aiming for somewhat realistic and elegant book-keeping), I would recommend one of the following for your MC Reaction in that situation (your hard move):<br/><br/>* Give the bully a String on the PC. (To focus the action on the PC's relationship with the bully.)<br/>* Give the PC a Condition. (To focus the action on how this makes the PC look in front of the whole class.)<br/><br/>That second option is easier to track, simpler, and generally better than giving a whole crew of PCs and NPCs each a String.

You can consider porting in the rules from 1st Edition, or you can just really commit to making a big deal of that Condition moving forward - treat it narratively, in other words, rather than mechanically.<br/><br/>That usually works best, although with my group I had some trouble with that when certain Conditions reflected personal relationships and status rather than a wider reputation (as in the school).<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/enricoboschin" rel="nofollow">enricoboschin</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The backstory of the Vampire says:<br/>Someone once saved your unlife.

A creature or person who has "returned from the dead", as a vampire has, is called "undead". So, here, it simply means that 'someone once saved your [life].' However, the term "unlife" is used, instead, to indicate that this happened after your character turned into a vampire (who, strictly speaking, doesn't have a normal "life" anymore).<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/enricoboschin" title="enricoboschin"><img alt="enricoboschin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/enricoboschin">enricoboschin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470670/#Comment_470670" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-14T23:33:29+00:00" title="March 14, 2018 11:33PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Just going by the examples in the book (and aiming for somewhat realistic and elegant book-keeping), I would recommend one of the following for your MC Reaction in that situation (your hard move):<br/><br/>* Give the bully a String on the PC.
