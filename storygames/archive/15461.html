I also reread <a href="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/remember/index.html" rel="nofollow">Remember Tomorrow</a> recently. Could I bring these two games together?<br/><br/>Advantages: firstly, they both have a tremendous amount of <b>Orange</b>. It's lovely. And there's a good structure in the world of DX:HR to work with, and a framework for addressing some great posthuman cyberpunk themes. If you find other players who are genuinely interested in effectively creating thematic fanfic.<br/><br/>Disadvantages: I think that RT's default style is more of that perfect Gibson vibe, and its shades of silicon gray are different from the neo-renaissance/pre-collapse world of DX:HR. More importantly: supposing I found some players who were interested in this game due to their knowledge of Deus Ex, there's a risk of getting a mismatch of expectation.<br/><br/>The Deus Ex games have some rich tactical play because of the alternative ways they offer the player a solution to their conflicts - crazy cyberware, run-and-gun, sneak and shock, or just sneak away in a pacifistic fashion. This is all still a reflection of the challenge in using the facts of the fiction to create a solution. I'm uncertain that <i>Remember Tomorrow</i> can provide moments of that kind of tactical, problem-solving experience, but I'd like to hear how you'd approach it.<br/><br/>(For those who haven't read it yet: Remember Tomorrow is GM-less with shared character roles, and is about the interweaving storylines that result as the PCs seek out their goals and face off against each other and ominous Factions.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350632/#Comment_350632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T20:19:38+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  8:19PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RT and tactical play are antithetical. <br/><br/>I feel like you can do DX no problem with RT.

In our case this would be an interwoven story version of Eclipse Phase which I think will work with reflavoured tables.<br/><br/>Was thinking about starting a thread on using RT with some sort of simple Fiasco Playset model. We love Fiasco, but want a game where you can advocate a little more. There are a couple of samples for this on Box Ninja and complex stories like Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle or The Difference Engine strike me as doable with RT.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350864/#Comment_350864" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T20:50:47+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  8:50PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2011 8:52PM by DevP.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will take the Tech Noir suggestion and read through the PDF when I can.<br/><br/>Still, I do have an idea of how I'd adapt with RT. Perhaps my idea isn't "tactical" so much as immersing in an occasional challenge in a fictionally grounded way. I'm not sure if this is simply a kind of Face Off scene, or if it's a kind of Colour scene really, perhaps with a rules tweak where the players choose Outcomes for each other. Let me describe what I'm thinking of:<br/><br/>Controller: "Your argument is terribly convincing, and the Terra Nova initiate is leading you out of the building. He walks you out into a rather dark alleyway; you can bearly make out some rusted fire-escapes above you, and the pounding of the rain is muffling any sound." {hinting<br/><br/>Bancroft: "I flip on my Deep Scanning optics and quickly flip my gaze upwards. Any guards or heat up there?"<br/><br/>Controller: "It's crawling with them on everything but the rooftop. It's dense with guards. The initiate nudges you in the ribs to quit stalling." {leading from the fiction with what the Initiate <br/><br/>Bancroft: "Pointless if what I need is in the basement. Next time he reaches for me, I make skin-contact and activate my taser-touch. Once he's fried, I grab the ident card and swipe myself into the lab below."<br/><br/>Controller: "And with that, you're in. Trade Outcomes? Maybe Burned Out for Dangerous?"<br/><br/>ETA: I'm in fact thinking this kind of exchange is, indeed, either a Colour or Face/Off scene, depending on how much the Controller wants to Resist at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Bruce" title="Robert Bruce"><img alt="Robert Bruce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Bruce">Robert Bruce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351053/#Comment_351053" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T15:40:03+00:00" title="December  9, 2011  3:40PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A truly representative Deus Ex storygame will reward the player for spouting cool <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To2KassxUeE" rel="nofollow">one-liners</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351106/#Comment_351106" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T15:19:08+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  3:19PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your colour scene idea would work fine within the existing RT rules.<br/><br/>If only he took his sunglasses off during those one liners, they would be 49% better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
