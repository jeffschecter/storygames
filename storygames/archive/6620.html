Some DMs like to add a sixth hat to that stack: rules designer. House rules are variants on the basic rules designed specifically for a particular DM\u2019s campaign. They add fun to your D&amp;D game by making it unique, reflecting specific traits of your world.<br/><br/>A house rule also serves as a handy patch for a game feature that your group dislikes. The D&amp;D rules cannot possibly account for the variety of campaigns and play styles of every group. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>If you disagree with how the rules handle something, changing them is within your rights.</b></span><br/><br/>This advice can\u2019t turn you into an expert game designer - we\u2019d need more than a page for that. Instead, this is a basic introduction to the concepts behind rules design. Once you\u2019ve become familiar with these ideas, the best way to learn more about game design is to play, see what\u2019s fun and what\u2019s not, and use your discoveries to guide your own work.</blockquote>\nNow I'm not sure the bredth and depth of this rule is understood. Not that it needs to be, but it'd make any discussion I have about roleplay alot easier. So here goes.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest issue is a perception that if any use of the rule feels bad, then it must have been used wrong.<br/><br/>In the other thread I was tempted to give examples like turning up for a game of 4e, and being presented with poker, since every rule had been altered. But I knew this would get rejected "That's an absurd use! No one would do it like that, it's clearly an incorrect use of the rule!"<br/><br/>But it isn't. It's like a gun - the results from firing a gun might feel bad, but that doesn't mean the gun itself was used incorrectly.<br/><br/>This is the bredth and depth of 'The GM can change any rule'. If you think about it without the restriction of 'If it feels bad, it was used wrong' you realise it can ahnihilate every rule in the book. That it can drag in poker and call it 4e. That there are no rules which will definately be a part of 4e, except one. The only rule you will definately encounter in 4e's is that the GM can change any rule. All 4e consists of is 'The GM can change any rule'. Everything else is an option. Options that you can't count on to be present.<br/><br/>If I offered this equation, where the contents of each bracket are optional to add, does this add up to a correct answer?<br/>(1)+(5)+(2)+(3) = 0<br/><br/>Is that a correct answer? Given that each bracket is an optional add? If there are any math guys in the audience, yeah, I'm just making up the bracket thing (if there's a more elegant way of putting it, hit me with it).<br/><br/>Now, what is 'The GM has the right to change any rule' but to put <i>everything </i>in brackets? <br/><br/>Which means it can add up to zero*, correct? Even if that sucks complete ass. Even if it feels bad. Even if it seems morally bent.<br/><br/>"But we can tell him when it sucks and he wont want us to feel bad so he'll change (or if he doesn't, he must be a jerk!)"<br/><br/>And sadly, this, in the face of the rules bredth and depth, is dishonesty. To make it more fun, imagine you'd given him a licence to kill (cue bond music). But then you complain about someone he's about to kill. Did you or didn't you give him a licence to kill? Did or didn't you give him a licence to ditch any rule?<br/><br/>You can't give but not really give, as a way of managing the bullshit the absolute power invokes. Not unless you want to trade honesty like a commodity.<br/><br/><br/>Now, will any refute with their own metric? I've written this like an equation, where you can see my adding. I don't think it dives into the murk of belief or opinion, as much as 1+1=2 isn't about belief or opinion. I would appreciate responces which build their own equation, or question the method by which my equation adds up.<br/><br/>Or if you already find this useful, great!!! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/>* Hmmm, 'Rule zero' seems more apt a name than I realised...<br/><br/>Edit: I misspelled 'Breadth' in the title.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146945/#Comment_146945" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T17:56:24+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  5:56PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2008 5:56PM by Marco.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to understand you: are you saying that acknowledging house rules is a bad thing?

Like I can say, "I want the game to be more deadly so all weapons have their die size increased."  To me that's cool.  That's a thoughtful customization to the game to create the experience you want.  House Rules and Customizations can be written on piece of paper and handed out to everyone so there are no surprises.  Hell, I know people who play In Wicked Age with only two exchanges instead of three.  Customization is cool, fun and fair.<br/><br/>What I have a problem with is that the GM can just change rules mid-game on a whim.  A player scores a critical hit on a powerful NPC and the GM thinks, "No this guy shouldn't go down that easy.  No critical hits on this guy."  The NPC in question then fails his saving throw against polymorphed and again the GM thinks, "No, this fight is supposed be tough and climactic, polymorphing just isn't right.  Sorry, he's immune to polymorph."  The the battle shifts out into a pool and suddenly the GM announces, "Because of the intensity of the fight I want to give everything a dream like quality so water slows your movement but 2/3 instead of 1/2"  What?  It's in my "rights" to change the rules.<br/><br/>THAT's what bothers me.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146953/#Comment_146953" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T18:32:23+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  6:32PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marco, you call it an acknowledgement.

Role Playing games, like games in general are hard to define, so instead of some "if it has this then it is rpg" we have a whole lot of not well defined "if it has a bunch of these, its an rpg".  Althought recognizing the players as an audience in a more traditional/argumentative way (almost more like art i would think) is interesting. But to get to a less silly example, are solitary rpg's still rpg's? What about an rpg that has the results of sporting events as its random determinator (which is kind of kewl idea) , what about rpg's with scripted sequences? are these still rpg's? No need for the somewhat silly poker example<br/>\n<br/>\nto use op's example instead of (x)+(y)+(z)=(a) and any element may be ignored, there is also the rule that for it to still be an equation of the same sort, some element has to remain on both sides of the =. Any Element may still be ignored, but here's an addittional rule that your ignoring in a somewhat extreme approach that I think most people would subscribe to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146994/#Comment_146994" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T08:51:52+00:00" title="May 31, 2008  8:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2008 8:52AM by Jeffrey Straszheim.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, to try to clear things up, your fear is that, armed with rule zero, a GM can change any or all of the rules without telling the players, so they show up to play D&amp;D and end up playing tiddlywinks, or some crap, and they HAVE NO LEGITIMATE complaint, and will just have to shut up and play?<br/><br/>Seriously?<br/><br/>Somehow I'm blessed.

My poor brain is too tiny to understand. But I want to address this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>What I have a problem with is that the GM can just change rules mid-game on a whim.  A player scores a critical hit on a powerful NPC and the GM thinks, "No this guy shouldn't go down that easy.  No critical hits on this guy."  The NPC in question then fails his saving throw against polymorphed and again the GM thinks, "No, this fight is supposed be tough and climactic, polymorphing just isn't right.  Sorry, he's immune to polymorph."  The the battle shifts out into a pool and suddenly the GM announces, "Because of the intensity of the fight I want to give everything a dream like quality so water slows your movement but 2/3 instead of 1/2"  What?  It's in my "rights" to change the rules.</blockquote>\nI agree situations like this can be frustrating, but there are times when these sorts of changes can be made without being unfair, at least in the view of my group. Say this is D&amp;D, I have written my villain's stats down, and we've established through nine thousand other scenes that he's undead and immune to critical hits, but I did not write 'undead' or 'immune to critical hits' on the sheet. It is not unfair to say "whoops, I forgot, he's immune to critical hits".  And the same is true if it has never been established in even one scene. The GM, and the players, in our group, are permitted to fix their mistakes. If a player says, "I grab her by the scarf and spin her around." and someone says "dude, don't you remember, we stole her scarf ten minutes ago", the player shouldn't fail the action for virtue of grabbing at something that isn't there. The same is true if the GM says "She has no scarf at the moment" and it's a fact that's never been established before.<br/><br/>This is a very different situation from if <i>the opposite</i> has been established - i.e. we know the bad guy is able to be polymorphed, because we've seen it happen before, or heard about it from reliable sources, or so on. Then it might be more unfair for the GM to correct an oversight, because it doesn't just affect things immediately, it also may affect things that have gone before. That's undeniably problematic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147006/#Comment_147006" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T10:36:15+00:00" title="May 31, 2008 10:36AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2008 10:36AM by Jeffrey Straszheim.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The deal is that folks assume that because some GM technique can be used abusively, it must <i>always</i> imply abuse.<br/><br/>I don't want to defend the GM changing stuff on a whim, because there are billions of obvious examples of how that can screw up a game.

Where? When? Can you point me to exactly where, in my post, I have said something like this?<br/><br/>But don't worry, I am not really interested in the answer to that question. I know that you can't do it, because I never did such thing.<br/><br/>The question that I REALLY would like to get an answer to, someday, is WHY EVERY SINGLE TIME somebody says anything against a "rule zero", some people start to push up straw-men, close their eyes to what it was really written, and begin to attack some strange silly notion of what was said that exist only in their head.<br/><br/>It's like the self-esteem of a lot of GM was very strongly tied to the "terrible power they wield, as the rightful owner of the POWER OF THE RULE ZERO", but that's impossible, what kind of GM would be turned on by the "power" (only in their mind, usually) to fully control what their friend do?<br/><br/>Ah-hem...<br/><br/>Let's return to reality, OK? <br/><br/>The problematic nature of that rule isn't that, by some sort of divine power, the players MUST OBEY THE SUPREME VIKING HAT. Let's not be silly. It's that the players are under no obligation to do so, and so, saying that "advice" to the master, "you can do anything because this book give you the power" is going to cause a lot of social problems, because that book has no power whatsoever to really do this. The GM, really, has only his personal authority and the trust the players give him. He should work to INCREASE that trust, and instead people put text in game books that undermine that trust. Text that tell him bullshit about his "power". An inexistent "power" that someday could push him to do something that the players would never agree to, and then he would discover how much really is the "power" that the "all-mighty rule zero" give him.<br/><br/>That rule goes against the way real people reach true agreements. It's as simple like that.  It's like a rule that told you that to convince people to do what you want, you should fart. Or wear a viking hat. Or whatever.<br/><br/>A lot of people are not so clueless to follow blindly that rule? Good for them. But this don't excuse that rule. A sign that say "drive drunk" isn't less wrong because most people can see by themselves that it's dangerous advice.<br/><br/>By the way, more proof that you really didn't even read what was posted before rushing to defend the All-mighty Rule Zero:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim</cite><br/>I don't want to defend the GM changing stuff on a whim, because there are billions of obvious examples of how that can screw up a game.

You say:\n<blockquote><br/>It made the game better. </blockquote>\nI don't think so. In my (personal) opinion, you killed the game. Or, at least, you played something very different from DitV. The inescapable risk of death when you stay in conflict and accept d10s of fallout is what give "bite" to the risk the character are taking and their hard choices. Take this way, and the "hard choices" become "yawn...  will I narrate my saving the girl using the gun, or not?" or, at least, turn the game in a round-robin parlor game.<br/><br/>But this is MY opinion (and the opinion of the game designer, seeing that he said this in his blog, but let's not stray from the subject). If the new game you played was better in your opinion... well, that's YOUR game.<br/><br/>But let's say that you and me play, sometime, DitV together. My character die because I roll a 20 on the fallout roll, saving a little child. Let's say you, as in the example, DON'T use the rule zero and instead act in a civil way with the people who play with you and say that you want my character to be alive. I will be very strongly against it. To the point of leaving the game if my character will have his thematic choice stolen from him in that way because the GM has a "better story" in mind (and, by the way, THAT it's what railroading is all about)<br/><br/>In DitV all the roll are "open", so you can't save my character without me noticing it. So we argue, and we reach an agreement WITHOUT rule zero.<br/><br/>Let's say we are playing D&amp;D. Same situation. You kill my character behing the GM screen. But you don't use rule zero and talk to me about saving my character. I still say no. No rule zero, we reach an agreement.<br/><br/>let's say we are playing D&amp;D. Same situation. Bu, this time, you USE RULE ZERO, and "save" my character without asking me, because the book say that it's your responsibility to "save the story". From my choices.<br/><br/>In this situation, I trusted you, and you betraide that trust. Care to explain to me again how that rule isn't negative to the group trust and agreement? <br/><br/>Even worse: I KNOW that that rule exist in the game you are using. I know that you are not enough social-savy to drop that rule. I know that, if you say that my character wasn't killed, you could be liying.<br/><br/>I don't trust you. My character COULD be really alive, I could have made that roll...  and I still would have doubt. You would not need to do anything, for the rule zero to ruin the social context of the game.<br/><br/>It's more clear now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147025/#Comment_147025" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T14:00:22+00:00" title="May 31, 2008  2:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Who?

All people play homebrews at every moment of play forever.  There is no "there" there. I am interested in whether the game I am playing is good, and whether <i>in practice</i> a particular technique works or does not work. For you, that technique would not work. For his group, your technique would be a blithering failure and ruin everyone's fun because you feel you have to be loyal to something a game designer thought of thousands of miles away who never met anyone in your group.<br/><br/>Now I am mainly interested in what others have taken away from this "rule zero" (so badly named and overbroad, but okay), because I didn't see anything in it that we hadn't already absorbed into our methods of play a long time ago. I don't agree that there's no help that can be given or guidance that can be provided to GMs to make them more "talented", I don't really know that "talented" applies in this situation. It's a technique, a procedure, just like everything else, and I know <i>my</i> application of it could always stand improvement...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147036/#Comment_147036" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T16:33:18+00:00" title="May 31, 2008  4:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2008 4:33PM by droog.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha ha JD is using Forgisms.

But I knew this would get rejected "That's an absurd use! No one would do it like that, it's clearly an incorrect use of the rule!"</blockquote>\nTen years ago, I got invited to a AD&amp;D game that used percentiles instead of D20, eight new stats, hit locations, and the paladin had a laser sword. So I guess it's not that far out. But it's part of the point.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>This is the bredth and depth of 'The GM can change any rule'. If you think about it without the restriction of 'If it feels bad, it was used wrong' you realise it can ahnihilate every rule in the book. That it can drag in poker and call it 4e. That there are no rules which will definitely be a part of 4e, except one. The only rule you will definitely encounter in 4e's is that the GM can change any rule. All 4e consists of is 'The GM can change any rule'. Everything else is an option. Options that you can't count on to be present.<br/></blockquote>\nI've said it in the DMG thread, and I'll repeat it here. The section is called 'Creating House Rules', it presents a clear reason for creating them, "a handy patch for a game feature that your group dislikes", and it presents a process to design the new rule. Which is not the same as "rule zero" in, for instance, Vampire: The Masquerade 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>But, in general, both games grant the power to change the rules to the GM, 4e in a more structured way, and Vampire in a much more free and capricious way (whenever you think it would be more fun). The first similitude I see to both approaches is government. 4e is like democarcy (sort of): you have a problem, you go with your congressman and ask him to change the law to a more convenient one, or, specifically, the congressman sees a problem, and proceeds to go and change a law. Vampire is like a monarchy. The monarch, on a whim, can raise taxes just because he feels that's better (and a good monarch might actually be right) without previous notice or consult. <br/><br/>Does this mean that the Constitution has only one rule, that it can be changed? If it were to change so much that it resembled the law of country, would it actually be a different country? The fact that the monarch can change a rule at any time invalidate all his previous rules? Now, imagine the opposite, a government in which all the laws are fixed and you can't change them. It clearly states that's not within your rights. Would it be functional?<br/><br/>Surely, a democratic government might go too far, and a monarch can be overthrown, they have to exercise their right to praxis with care (not that much, really) if they don't want that to happen. The 4e DMG states as much: "You have the authority to do whatever you<br/>want with the game, but your efforts won\u2019t help if you have no group."<br/><br/>In the end, both in nations and roleplaying games, it all comes down to the social contract. You grant the DM certains rights in exchange for some benefits and viceversa. In the case of D&amp;D 4e, you grant him the right to change a rule if its effect displeases the group. In Vampire, you grant him the right to tweak anything in the name of fun. It's not, as Moreno says, a rule that goes against how we reach agreements as people. It's one of the many ways we actually do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147038/#Comment_147038" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T17:05:23+00:00" title="May 31, 2008  5:05PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Ha ha JD is using Forgisms.</blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/macro/kabong.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147041/#Comment_147041" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T17:57:08+00:00" title="May 31, 2008  5:57PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite><br/>I uh, don't think he's talking to you.

Well and good. What I find interesting is that while we, in our 7th-9th grade male way, were completely obsessed with both following the rules to the letter and simultaneously finding loopholes to demonstrate our cleverness/prowess, we valued being able to find and cite the appropriate rule as being the ending of an argument. In other words, the authority whose view we were seeking was the designer's view. None of us asked, "Well, between rule interpretation A and rule interpretation B, what is the best one to select for our group in this moment?" It was always "between rule interpretation A and rule interpretation B, which one is clearly the most supported by the game text."<br/><br/>Yet this was problematic for us for a very simple reason: it was clear that the designers did not follow the same rules they gave to us.  D&amp;D modules were rife with characters with too many hit points, too low an armor class, special magic powers that broke the rules for magic powers, permanent effects in dungeons that violated the rules of what permanent magic effects did, or worse, what the rules told us permanent magic effects were like in the setting (really important! hard to set up!)  We became increasingly frustrated with what we perceived as inconsistencies in the rules that we were constantly seeking to find some authority in. And if we hadn't been 7-9th grade boys and therefore <i>fucking morons</i> we would have seen that this was only to be expected when dealing with a property that was worked on by multiple people over the course of many years, and even when it was the same person, they clearly refined their designs and changed their views of what the best sort of rule was, as you might expect any human being on god's green earth to do if you thought about it for five fucking seconds.<br/><br/>Faced with the knowledge that the designer's intent A) didn't matter, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> was stupid, C) changed all the time, there was really no choice. We couldn't just keep searching the rules for the rule we wanted. Someone would have to decide. The game identified an authority, the GM. This kicked it back to the social level for a while. ("Young JD's games are like this, whereas Young Brian's games are like that.") Eventually we started to work out criteria for when a rules interpretation, patch, or replacement was a good idea or a bad idea, usually based around the needs of the individual group, their preferences, their <i>fucking schedules</i>, their experience level, their comfort level, etc. And that is how I eventually interpreted "change the rules if you want!" rules - to push people who had not been as far down our road as we had further down the road.<br/><br/>So that is why "rule zero" is a no-brainer to me (godawful though the piece of jargon may be.) All rules are rule zero. Everyone chooses either to apply a rule, mis-apply it, or ignore it, at every moment of play, and it's the choice that controls the game, not the written rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147061/#Comment_147061" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T00:35:23+00:00" title="June  1, 2008 12:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rene,<br/><br/>A perceptive post that actually compares the structure against something similar.\n<blockquote>Surely, a democratic government might go too far, and a monarch can be overthrown, they have to exercise their right to praxis with care (not that much, really) if they don't want that to happen.

The breadth of rule zero is that you can change anything.  The depth is...how much you can change it?  That would seem to assume that there is some way to measure (or at least estimate) how different the end result is from the rule we started with, which I suppose seems reasonable.  I'm not sure that's what we're talking about here though.<br/><br/>What it sounds more like to me is that the depth is interpreted as "how much of the game you change," rather than the distance between the original and what it's changed to.  So, for example, changing 30% of the rules is "deeper" than changing 10% of the rules.<br/><br/>The text about "rule zero" doesn't place limits on any of these 3 dimensions, neither breadth nor the two depth interpretations.  Something about that lack of limitation seems to rub Callan the wrong way, but I'm not sure which of these is most bothersome.  Clarify that for us?  Why does that particular dimension bother you?<br/><br/>On another front, they <i>could</i> have added text to the effect of "if everyone agrees."  But then they run the risk of imposing a situationally inappropriate social structure on the group.  Some groups can only work as a "monarchy."  Some groups have specific method for making decisions (something like a constitution.)  Some groups are fully democratic.  If it works, none of those are necessarily bad.  So the omission of text to that effect allows the group to plug in whichever decision making process they find appropriate -- this seems like a good thing to me.  The flip side of this is that the text seems to imply that the power rests solely in the GM's hands, which is an equally inappropriate endorsement of a certain decision making process that won't work for some groups.  Something like "The group can make changes to the rules to make them work for their particular playstyle" would leave it appropriately ambiguous I think.

I don't think I have ever saw a tSoY game where people didn't come up with new keys and secrets, and many of the procedures of the game are left to the group judgment, following their usual procedures to arrive at an agreement, without trying to force a different procedure on them. And, at the same time, there are instead real "rules" about many game procedures, told factually with self-assurance and without the waffling implicit in any rule that say "if this don't work, write a rule that work by yourself".<br/><br/>People still can change any rules they want, using the usual procedure they use to change any rule in any game, from Monopoli to Poker (than can be "we talk about it" or "We trust Mike, if it's all right for him, we go along", or "let's try it once to see if it works",, or any other way.  And there is a lot of latitude for personal styles and preferences even without changing any rule. But there is the basilar understanding that nobody will "cheat" (for example, fudging die rolls).<br/><br/>And, incredible, people still can play these game without a rule that "allow" them to do so!

I mean, whatever the rule is intended to mean, as written it clearly presupposes an competitive relationship between the GM and the other players in terms of deciding what the fun <i>is</i>.  Otherwise, it would focus on the positive (creating a ruleset that best fits the group) rather than the negative (creating a ruleset that manages not to run off the other players).<br/><br/>Mature, uber-experienced roleplayers, and particularly those who design their own games, should have no problem ignoring that presupposition.  Sometimes rose-colored glasses are <i>worth</i> putting on, and many people have a good idea of when to do it.<br/><br/>But I think Callan is correct (if I'm not putting words in his mouth) that there will be some GMs for whom the writing of this rule will confuse the real issue: not whether the players are still showing up, but whether the group fun is being maximized.  Hell, even <i>great</i> GMs can forget to distinguish between those two goals on occasion.  Each and every rule should clarify that distinction, not muddle it even more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147120/#Comment_147120" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T13:04:16+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  1:04PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2008 1:05PM by Max Higley.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The GM is a natural fit for this in games with a GM as adjudicator of the game world.</blockquote>\nI see the distinction you're making.  These issues are related, certainly, but I think they're distinct -- on the one hand, we've got "the authority structure in the game" and on the other we've got "the authority structure surrounding the game."  Aligning these two is a natural fit perhaps, but not the only possibility.<br/><br/>I can play a game with strong GM authority, and still have a social contract that says "Rules interpretation decisions are made by consensus."  Similarly, I can play a game where the players have more authority to introduce and control things beyond their character with a social contract that says "Bill decides what the rules are."  I'll refrain from commenting on how wise doing either of these are; I merely mean to point out that these are possibilities, and perhaps ones that see use in some groups.<br/><br/>Leaving room for those possibilities, I think the most general solution is to suggest that groups work out rule modifications according to their local social contract.  (Of course, it's so general there's almost no way to argue against it.  How would you even do otherwise?)<br/><br/>EDIT: Well said, Burr.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment"

In order to the last thing, what do you need to do? Change the rules.<br/><br/>The big difference between the social contract in a game and the social contract in a nation is that, in the last case, What AcF said in his last post is not funny or surreal but sadly true: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: a Metaphorical Accounting for Taste</cite>Gov: Just so you know, I was unhappy with tax law in the Constitution, so I've changed them all.<br/>Citizen: You can't do that!  I hate all your changes -- this isn't the nation I wanted to live in!<br/>Gov: Too bad, you have to live here!  Now shuffle this deck of cards and get ready to arm-wrestle me for taxes!  And don't forget, my new rules say that you will always lose, and also you will have to pay me $100 for every purchase you make!<br/>Citizen: What gives you the right to do these crazy things?<br/>Gov:This book does! [Flourishes the Constitution and points to the paragraphs about presidential attribution.]  See?  This rule says that I can change everything if I want to, and you can't stop me!<br/>Citizen: O, I am undone!<br/>Gov: [Twirls mustachios while laughing cruelly]<br/>Citizen: Since I have no choice, I will play by your rules.  Curses upon the Congress for giving you so much power, you evil President!</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Now, it isn't cheating to vote a government out, I think we can agree.

But then they run the risk of imposing a situationally inappropriate social structure on the group.</b> Some groups can only work as a "monarchy." Some groups have specific method for making decisions (something like a constitution.) Some groups are fully democratic. If it works, none of those are necessarily bad. So the omission of text to that effect allows the group to plug in whichever decision making process they find appropriate -- this seems like a good thing to me. The flip side of this is that the text seems to imply that the power rests solely in the GM's hands, which is an equally inappropriate endorsement of a certain decision making process that won't work for some groups. Something like <b>"The group can make changes to the rules to make them work for their particular playstyle"</b> would leave it appropriately ambiguous I think. Thoughts?</blockquote>\nWith the first bolded passage, adding "if everyone agrees" would run the risk of imposing a situationally inappropriate social structure? But plain old "The GM has the right to change any rule" wouldn't run that risk?<br/><br/>Don't you think they both run that risk? Why does it get exemption? I've basically spent this thread noting reasons why it has that same risk you talk about. But while "The GM can change any rule if the group agrees" is risky, "The GM can change any rule" is apparently free of that risk. Why are they different? Or is it a matter of 'Well, everyone <i>just knows</i> what 'The GM can change any rule' mean?<br/><br/>On your second bolded passage, assuming the designers want it to be ambiguous, that seems good wording. Is there some text in the DMG like that? I'll still go with 'ill chosen words' (as I noted in the original thread) to have written the GM has the right, then placed those words somewhere else.

That was my point about whether overthrowing the monarch was honest or not - if you agreed not to walk away from them, or pretended to agree, is that honest?<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me. When I say I'm going accept the invitation to a session, I agree to turn up, pay attention and stay there for some amount of time (usually, since RP seems to need it, several hours).<br/><br/>Now, I fully admit in a shit roleplay session I will leave. But I don't think it's honest of me to break my agreement just because the session sucks. I think it's dishonest, but at the same time I wont stay for that crap just to be honest. But I accept I broke my agreement with them.<br/><br/>Now other people might accept the invitation and agree to go, but during a poor session they will walk out. Or perhaps more traditionally, the passive "sit back in chair and not really pay attention" (essentially the same as walking out, just less dramatic).<br/><br/>The DMG seems to suggest the group dropping out is a counterweight to 'GM can change any rule'. From my perspective it says people ought to be dishonest (breaking their agreement), as if that's a means to a better game. That's why, way at the first post, I noted 'You can't give, but not really give'. Do you always have the option to walk out, even when you agreed you wouldn't?<br/><br/>Atleast in my own case, I don't have the option to walk out - not without starting to break principles I don't want to break over a stupid table top game.

I blame WOTC.<br/><br/>No, really.\n<blockquote>Creating House Rules<br/><br/>As Dungeon Master, you wear several hats: storyteller, rules arbiter, actor, adventure designer, and writer. Some DMs like to add a sixth hat to that stack: rules designer. House rules are variants on the basic rules designed specifically for a particular DM\u2019s campaign. They add fun to your D&amp;D game by making it unique, reflecting specific traits of your world.<br/><br/>A house rule also serves as a handy patch for a game feature that your group dislikes. The D&amp;D rules cannot possibly account for the variety of campaigns and play styles of every group.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>If you disagree with how the rules handle something, changing them is within your rights.</b></span><br/><br/>This advice can\u2019t turn you into an expert game designer - we\u2019d need more than a page for that. Instead, this is a basic introduction to the concepts behind rules design. Once you\u2019ve become familiar with these ideas, the best way to learn more about game design is to play, see what\u2019s fun and what\u2019s not, and use your discoveries to guide your own work.</blockquote>Nobody says "it is within your rights" except during an actual or presumed legal struggle. And it's usually not the rules of a game, it's usually actual real-world <i>law</i>. Look at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22it+is+within+your+rights%22" rel="nofollow">Google</a>. Landlord vs. Tenant. Police vs. suspect. Etc. Etc.<br/><br/>WOTC seems to be anticipating conflict from every change to the rules, whether it's between WOTC and DMs ("I <i>guess</i> if you want to change the rules we <i>slaved</i> over, we can't actually <i>stop</i> you from ruining the game") or DMs and players ("<i>I'm</i> the DM so <i>I</i> have the right to change the rules, and I did, so shut up").<br/><br/>When modifying the rules is less contentious, then there's no reason to formalize the limits of rule changing by setting limits and which rules can be changed by how much. The social contract will be the arbiter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147189/#Comment_147189" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T20:40:13+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  8:40PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>With the first bolded passage, adding "if everyone agrees" would run the risk of imposing a situationally inappropriate social structure?

We're talking about honesty, and that seems to be the underlying value in your judgment of the rule. However, I do think it's honest. Dishonesty would be option two, sitting there without really paying attention or even worst, secretly plotting to overthrow the GM. Talking with him to settle things and walking away if you can't reach an agreement is quite honest. And both of these ideas are presented, in that order, in the DMG. (I find it lacking that this material isn't in the PHB, but it seems this DMG is not for DM's only).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>The DMG seems to suggest the group dropping out is a counterweight to 'GM can change any rule'. From my perspective it says people ought to be dishonest (breaking their agreement), as if that's a means to a better game.

Do you always have the option to walk out, even when you agreed you wouldn't?<br/><br/>Atleast in my own case, I don't have the option to walk out - not without starting to break principles I don't want to break over a stupid table top game.

We're having this discussion because it means something to us. We really enjoy roleplaying.<br/><br/>Also, you do can "give, but not really give". Every rule has a counterweight, they're not absolutes. The monarch received it's right to rule from God himself, an absolute authority if there's one, and still people plotted against him and in some cases even beheaded him. Was that honest? in the purest sense of the word, I think it is.<br/><br/>I think Levi's got it right in his previous post. But there is a reason, but in the real world and roleplaying games, that not all thing are decided by consensus. We elect our officials, but we do not sit wit them on every issue that needs to be fixed. We give them great power to solve them in the way they think is convenient and also power to change the rules. In D&amp;D, we give the same power to the DM. In none of those cases we do it out of some delussion, and most politicians also aren't qualified, even when it's more arguable that they should.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147235/#Comment_147235" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T06:37:18+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  6:37AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Now, I fully admit in a shit roleplay session I will leave.

No one that joins a D&amp;D group would expect a Toon-like game where no one dies, they just fall down, right?<br/>\n2) There is not rules-lawyering, endless debate or rules so rigid that the GM cannot be creative.<br/>\n  The idea behind Rule 0 is to set that balance. Meaning, if everyone at the table agrees that saving vs 0-damage from a Death Ray is unrealistic or whatever, then they can agree to save vs half your HPs, and not feel like they broke the game or whatever. But, it does open the door for some dickery and that is where, I think, you have to rely on social contract to resolve. In other words, there is no way to write this rule in such a way that iy promotes creativity and flexibility to handle unexpected applications of the other rules, and prevent abuse of the rule, is there? If there is, re-write THAT rule in your game, no?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147446/#Comment_147446" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T21:13:31+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  9:13PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>And here the GM is armed with the right to change any rule.

If the designers had set out to design a book people could buy that creatively restrained them, (the restriction being that everyone has to agree to the rule change) then they have failed in that goal. That's the reason not to hand out a howitzer.<br/><br/>THAT IS, if it was their goal to have the GM change any rule, but with agreement from all.<br/><br/>If it was to sell unrestricted powers, that's a commodity they don't own in order to sell. They don't own other peoples consent (their consent to you gaining the power involved), to sell it in the first place. Unless were hitting some creative denial point here, were people like to pretend the GM just has power (and deny that they consented to give him that power)<br/><br/>So it's either an failure or the wording is delusional (or outright criminal). Disclaimer: If it's a creative denial thing, then I guess the only fruit of this conversation is the cherished denail torn assunder.

We don't take every action to its last bitter consequences every time, greater pay off or not. If the GM says "Hey, I've decided I'm going to use a d30 for monsters' attacks" I'm not going to wait a whole campaign to see if the rule works. It just doesn't make sense.

None.<br/><br/>Should they, then, have no authority structures?<br/>Hang on, he's got a point here.  The rules text as written is basically telling the GM "You have the power to make changes <i>and it is your players responsibility to consent to those changes, because we said so.</i>  Or they'll leave your game, in which case, that's your fault, not ours."  It's not up to Wizards whether or not the real people at the real table will be OK with the rules changes the GM makes.  It's up to those people.  And besides that, it's just bad, contradictory advice.  <br/><br/>Now, maybe this seems like a minor point, but I don't think it is.  Here's why: this particular clause gives a GM a handy excuse to act like a jackass, bypassing the existing social contract to rule by fiat, and then gives him a rule to point at in order to CYA.  That's certainly not the intent of the 4e passage quoted above, nor is it an inherent problem with rule zero.  It's just the way it's written.  If they'd thought about social contract half as much as the indie community has, this probably would have been more obvious to them.

Normally these days I look on these kinds of discussion and think of them like those philosophical Gotchas from back in the day: <br/>"You're on a lifeboat and can only save either your mother or your wife. WHO DO YOU SAVE?"<br/>"Uh, I try to save Both of them? I don't see why in a real world situation I can't do both. I figure the boat's big eno..."<br/>"No! You can only save one!"<br/>And then logic/philosophic argument completely divorced from reality ensues. (note: I've got a degree in Philosophy. (^.^; ) <br/><br/>So at that point, I'm thinking, "Yeah, this is why the theory sections of the Forge were closed". However, throughout this thread some cool stuff has been mentioned that got me thinking, in different ways. I also have some questions for Callan (at the bottom of this post) that I'd love to see answered, because I think that would ground the discussion in reality. <br/><br/>Usually the situations posed by the discussion are either too hypothetical to be of use, or they are hinting at something which hasn't been expressed clearly yet (as someone mentioned, is this about the relationship that is created? I'm not sure if that's what Callan means).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tablesaw</cite>Nobody says "it is within your rights" except during an actual or presumed legal struggle. And it's usually not the rules of a game, it's usually actual real-world<i>law</i>. Look at<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22it+is+within+your+rights%22" rel="nofollow">Google</a>. Landlord vs. Tenant. Police vs. suspect. Etc. Etc.</blockquote>\nHuh, I totally smell a Master's Thesis, right fucking there. That's a pretty astute observation.  So, for non-Fatlanders, one thing that I've seen over the last 20 years or so is that we've really, as a society/culture, adopted a lot of legalisms into our daily life. Law, law dramas, lawsuits (we're sue-happy: Personal injury isn't so much a tragedy, as a Lottery-like opportunity these days).  It's interesting that you tie "within your rights" to that culture, and seeing the connection there makes me think that, deep down, there's something to be said about that. Well, maybe not so much about WOTC in particular, as American cultural mindset in general.<br/><br/>I'm not really going anywhere with that thought, it was just one of the cool little "Huh" things that I picked up and started rolling around in my head (my other degree is Sociology, I'm afraid (^.^; ) \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>The same reason I don't walk out of a chess game when I start losing.</blockquote>\nThe big difference between metaphor and reality is that metaphors theoretically are practical, but in practice they are not. (^.^)<br/><br/>In this metaphor: Extremely long games of chess may take an hour or so (using the timer? Less). A bad game of RPGs that you don't walk out on can last a year, or forever. It's the difference between playing an unfun board game for a few hours Once, and deciding to, every week for the rest of your life, taking 4-5 hours one weekday evening and simply sitting in a Hospital Lobby in an Emergency Room.<br/><br/>So here's the thing, we're talking hypotheticals.  All the examples Callan used have been, hmmm... Theoretically sound, but practically (in a real world situation) hard to grasp.

I see no contradiction here, just pure description. The text doesn't say: "we're giving you the right to change the rules", it says "it's well within your right to change them", and it's actually within your right to change them. It's up to your players to consent and approve of the changes made to the rules. It's really not up to WotC.\n<blockquote>Now, maybe this seems like a minor point, but I don't think it is.  Here's why: this particular clause gives a GM a handy excuse to act like a jackass, bypassing the existing social contract to rule by fiat, and then gives him a rule to point at in order to CYA.  That's certainly not the intent of the 4e passage quoted above, nor is it an inherent problem with rule zero.  It's just the way it's written.  If they'd thought about social contract half as much as the indie community has, this probably would have been more obvious to them.  Or maybe it was, and they decided to ignore it, I don't know.</blockquote>\nI think the real issue here is that you could take any rule and use it for a handy excuse to act lie a jackass. This one's no different, but also not specially "jackassy" (Unlike Vampire's rule zero, which pretty much was a licence to be a jackass). But you can cling to say "Let it Ride" to be a jackass. You could also cling to a "sorry, the rules are written in stone" attitude to be a jackass.<br/><br/>I actually feel that the 4e shows way more thought about social contract than the "indie community" in general, but perhaps that's for another discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Torquemada" title="Torquemada"><img alt="Torquemada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Torquemada">Torquemada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147863/#Comment_147863" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T23:47:57+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 11:47PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi.\n<blockquote>A house rule also serves as a handy patch for a game feature that your group dislikes.

IIRC, when it's clear you're going to lose the game, you're expected to surrender your king. It's proper game etiquette. You do not play every chess match to check mate.<br/>This is an example of quiting before you lose? No it isn't. It's playing the whole thing through. Resigning is part of end game as much as check is.\n<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Rules aren't absolute, your right. I mean agree to them as if they are absolute.

So your telling me what I will agree with?<br/><br/>You may not treat them as absolutes. That's your choice - it's not because something inside you is just wired a certain way, let alone how everyone is.<br/><br/>Do we share some common ground that this is a choice and not a human condition? If you can't, that's cool, we seperate on whether people can choose to follow a rule fully and we can wrap it up at that.\n<blockquote>We don't take every action to its last bitter consequences every time, greater pay off or not. If the GM says "Hey, I've decided I'm going to use a d30 for monsters' attacks" I'm not going to wait a whole campaign to see if the rule works. It just doesn't make sense. Could there be a grater payoff? Maybe, but does it mean I should stay in that game as is?</blockquote>\nYes, I know. Part of what I'm saying. <b>IF</b> you want to try rules fully, then 'The GM can change any rule' doesn't make much sense.

(^.^)<br/><br/>In this metaphor: Extremely long games of chess may take an hour or so (using the timer? Less). A bad game of RPGs that you don't walk out on can last a year, or forever. It's the difference between playing an unfun board game for a few hours Once, and deciding to, every week for the rest of your life, taking 4-5 hours one weekday evening and simply sitting in a Hospital Lobby in an Emergency Room.<br/>Absolutely. This thread is about illustrating that with a <i>strict reading</i> of the rule, this is the sort of unpleasantness is as valid a move as moving a pawn one square forward in chess.<br/><br/>That's with a strict reading. You might <i>choose </i>not to read it strictly - I talked about that upthread. In this post I'll talk about it as if you do choose to read it strictly.<br/><br/>(side note: I basically need a flow chart - with a seperate branch for reading it strictly and non strictly)<br/><br/><br/>Okay, problem situation with a strict reading (on the GM's behalf): One: The player wants to jump across a chasm. The GM doesn't want him to, even though the rules would allow it. The GM simply says he can't. The player doesn't know the rules and simply assumes those are the rules, which is not the case.<br/><br/>Two: The player does know the rules, but thinks the GM is kinda somehow without words asking if he agrees he can't jump. The GM acts like he is asking, but really he doesn't think he has to. He simply pretends to ask to smooth things over. He's the GM after all - he just allows the players what he decides on.<br/><br/>Three: The player thinks he knows the rules, but doesn't understand the extent of what the GM can change. He challenges the GM call. The GM tells 'rules are up to change at any given time' (there's an example in this or the previous thread that a poster actually gave). The player doesn't believe the extent of the GM's powers (like many here don't think the rule grants him this power), so he thinks the GM a jerk. The GM thinks the player is a disruptive person who doesn't respect his position, and thinks he's a jerk. The go post on their respective forums about how it's each persons fault, never thinking perhaps the wording they both work with is bloody awful.<br/><br/>Repeat for about 10 years - or that's what I've seen in about ten years of scanning various RPG forums. It's probably been going for 30. And people seem to love rushing to blame the other person (or even themselves) rather than design.\n<blockquote>2) Callan: How would you have written that section instead? I mean, on the internet there's lots of deconstruction, but I'm really curious as to how you'd do it instead.</blockquote>\nI don't know the designers goals. But if they are as many here insist, it's that the GM can change any rule, as long as the group agrees. So how I'd put that is "The GM can change any rule, as long as the group agrees". Said this upthread, actually.<br/><br/>Yeah, nothing more complex than that. No, I dunno why the thread is so long!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Torquemada: Yes, it could mean just what you've said.

People said 'you can't play with an absolute reading of the rule' and I challenged that you can. I've seen about three different interpretations of how you play under the rule in this thread alone. But no one admits they chose to play that way, they think it really IS the one way to play. And that choice is valid. But thinking you didn't make a choice...no way.<br/><br/>Personally I don't think I've ever played with an absolute reading of "The GM can change any rule". But in play I have come across situations where I realised that an absolute reading of it was a valid one. Which meant the way I was playing, the things I ignored, or the wording I favoured, was my choice, and not the one way of playing that rule. I had made a choice. Yes, I've had a GM say they can do anything (and many who wouldn't say it with words, but body language instead). It was in those situations I realised I had just made my way of playing, had just chosen it. It wasn't the one way.<br/><br/>The fact is, when you have two ways of reading a rule (like an 'absolute' reading and some other reading, lets call it "X"), if the 'absolute reading' is horrible and nasty and yuck, that doesn't mean 'reading X' MUST be the way to play. Your still making a choice about which way you play.<br/><br/>That's part of this thread, to show the breadth and depth of "The GM can change any rule" with an absolute reading. To show even as horrible and bent and wrong it gets, it's STILL a choice. That your way of reading it feels good, doesn't mean you haven't made a choice. There being a good way and a bad way &lt;&gt; there being only one way.<br/><br/>It makes discussion harder when people talk about just one path existing, when there are two or more.

I dislike them because it's like the designers are saying "Our rules haven't been carefully constructed to produce a specific type of gameplay, so feel free to change them."  But I don't think that's wht the designers intend.  Even when designers don't have a rule zero, there's nothing stopping you from modifying the rules to get the feel you want from a game.  I believe the intention is for new players, who won't assume that houserules are an option (how many people houserule Monopoly, Candyland, World of Warcraft or other games they probably started with?) to get them comfortable with the idea that, due to the social nature of RPGs, it's nearly impossible to stick to the rules as written, keep everyone happy, and not encounter a situation that requires some critical thinking and rules invention. So, if putting in that section can help some new players get comfortable with flexing their imaginations a bit more, then it was worth it.<br/><br/>But, I've never had an experience where rule zero destroyed a game. I've played a lot of games with a lot of people. Sometimes we had official lists of houserules. Sometimes they were casually acknowledged. Often we played by the book. If a GM is willing to change things even if they make it less fun for the players, the lack of a rule zero won't stop him, and doesn't give the players any additional power to prevent it. Their power is unchanged - ignore it and play, refuse it and don't play, or use social tools to try and get the GM to understand and change his behavior before continuing to play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Anyway, one of the old (and probably a bit boring now) examples of there seeming to only be one path when there's more, is where two friends sit down to 'roleplay', but one only sees it as say, gamist facilitating, while the other only sees a path of sim.

House rules <i>might</i> (but rule zero isn't required. But the real solution is that they need to set the game aside and figure out some mutual goals they want from play, and then decide whether the game provides that or if they need to find something else that will.

Rule-zero gives that power, in print or not.<br/><br/>Of course, I haven't had to be so heavy handed in years, and not when gaming with friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148653/#Comment_148653" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T17:05:32+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  5:05PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            99 percent of the time when I, in any role, have to settle a rules dispute, I resolve it explicitly temporarily, "Well, let's do it this way for now, and we'll look at it in more detail before next time."

Sure, maybe <i>we</i> can, but that doesn't necessarily apply to everyone.  It seems to me to discount the possibility that those people who not currently "people worth playing with" might someday join it.  Given that 4e will be an introduction to roleplaying for a lot of people, teaching them how to make it work seems like a worthy goal.<br/><br/>In that context, the arguments about granting powers to the GM make sense to me.  Many people will interpret the passage as saying "Do what works for your group.  Don't let us ruin your fun, change things!"  And they will be fine.  Some people will read that passage as saying "Cool!  Now I get to decide the rules however I like!"  These people are, at that moment, not people I would choose to play with.  But they still should not be forever relegated to sub-par status.  They, you know, could learn, if someone was willing to teach them.<br/><br/>EDIT: What I'm really talking about here is the Curse of Knowledge: once you have it, it's hard to remember what it was like when you didn't.  I think that applies here.  Once you understand how to make a group work, it's hard to remember ever not knowing.  But at one point, all of us <i>didn't</i> know, and we had to learn.  This passage is a prime opportunity for a teaching moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148739/#Comment_148739" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T10:59:31+00:00" title="June  7, 2008 10:59AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I don't believe this thread.

The presence of a written rule zero will create different expectations for the readers than its absence. The context around rule-zeroes (all the other text, whether they are a rule or a piece of advice--a main-body-text or a sidebar, whether there is a primary directive to keep the game fun before the rule zero or the absence of one, and so on) will influence the reader's expectation and understanding of the game to some degree.<br/><br/>I even suppose there can be good and bad rule-zeroes (although most of the games I have looked at--even at their worst--did not contain the kind of "The GM should shut up players" advice that this is read at).<br/><br/>But here's the thing (and read this part carefully--because it explains a lot of this thread):<br/>1. The OP makes a fairly strange <b>and very strong</b> claim around rule-zero (it's like giving the GM-as-police a gun, it legitimizes horrendous changing of the rules, a player when confronted with these is somehow obligated to stay)<br/>2. People react to that.<br/>3. You get caught up in not recognizing the context (an extremely strong opening post) and get confused by what seems like a bunch of contradictory positions. Your posts, by themselves, might have gotten entirely different conversations.<br/><br/>For example: I am pretty sure that it'd be trivially easy to get Jeffrey's agreement that some hypothetical rule-zero text that read "The GM can change the game however he wants and the players had better just know their role and swallow it. Bitches." Would be <i>a bad rule</i>. Furthermore, I suspect that it would even qualify as a <i>kind</i> of rule zero. However, I suspect that his--and mine--view of what "rule zero" is does not conform to this extreme. In our world, rule-zero is more a text-legitimized policy that says the GM can intervene in mechanics for the enjoyment of the group.<br/><br/>As such you can decide to have that in the book or not--or to word it one way or another--and it becomes a matter of <i>specifics</i>  as to whether it is a good idea or not--or valuable or not (for example: although I think it is a legitimate rule, my game does not include rule-zero text anywhere or text <i>against</i> it. This was a conscious choice on my part). <br/><br/>You are casting people's posts in absolutes and it's <i>not making sense to you</i> when they aren't thinking in absolutes (and, note: Callan over several posts--and with his mathematical argument is, in fact, <i>being pretty darn absolute</i>--making a strong case). Callan's position doesn't make sense because in his case he's arguing that some kind of hypothetical worst-case scenario delegitimizes the whole concept.<br/><br/>That's controversial and hardly cut-and-dried.<br/><br/>-Marco<br/>* Forex, the "Herbie is real" argument you tried to make in the KF System Does Matter thread. The GM-referred-to in the essay is an example. In your world, herbie's GM is some kind of jerk (and you know real people who are, in your opinion, jerks). In my world, herbie's-GM is a reasonable person (I equate the situation in the essay to functional, reasonable people I know). Because the hypothetical person in the essay <i>is not real</i> arguments about the nature of the essay from your position won't convince me since your "herbie" does not match "my herbie"--and because you don't understand what I mean when I say "he's not real," you see my text as changing position (yes, your people are real people--but they are not literally the named person in the essay). You do this consistently and it creates problems in talking with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148821/#Comment_148821" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T08:12:47+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  8:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite><br/><br/>For example: I am pretty sure that it'd be trivially easy to get Jeffrey's agreement that some hypothetical rule-zero text that read "The GM can change the game however he wants and the players had better just know their role and swallow it.

Its exists in the GM contract and the player contract and it can if tolerated ruin a whole game, but the culprit isnt the game, its real social dynamics. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I was in a game of Serenity where one player repeatedly managed to screw with everyone else and ruin their enjoyment.

Instead of stopping people from using over-the-top hyperboles (the usual weapons used against the very matter-of-fact and concrete results from Forge theory) as he should have done, he went overboard pushing even bigger hyperboles, that were only new ammo ready to use against him. He should have stayed on reality, on concrete, real-life things that happen to everybody in play. Talking not about the hyperbolic damage that absurdest GM could do in a million years, but about the very real damage that most of GM who believe in "rule zero" do to their own social context, little by little, inch by inch. It's more difficult to see, because it's so little, so tiny, each time. The full effect can be seen only in the time frame of years. But once you have observed it, you can't stop noticing it. If you can make you interlocutor see it, even once, you have given him more "proof" that with hundreds of imaginary hyperbolic examples.<br/><br/>But the way he debated it don't change the reality of what he said at the beginning, in the previous thread, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6594&amp;page=1#Item_63" rel="nofollow">here</a>:<br/><b>"The delusion is the earnest belief a line of text in a book can grant you the consent of another person.</b>". Had he stayed firm on this, it would have been much more difficult to attack him.<br/><br/>This thread, about an hot topic that infringe on the self-esteem of a lot of "traditional" GMs, with people on BOTH sides that began posting over the top "conclusions" and hyperboles was a train wreck from the beginning. I have never seen a thread get to any useful conclusion in these conditions, so I tried to stay away, only posting to try (with no visible effect) a couple of time to keep it grounded in reality, and when some people in their haste to "fight" what Callan was saying began to go overboard talking nonsense about "what everybody know".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite><br/>To wit: I think it's okay to have a "rule zero" or not have it and doing both things are, in fact, subtly different and valid.

It's useful only if you want to paint people who think you don't need a "dictator-GM who defend the game from you" as people without imagination who hate house rules. <br/><br/>It was a doomed effort. Too many people who posted here were very invested in that conflating, being their only "weapon" they had (that, and over-the-top hyperboles). You only have to see the staggering percentage of people who posted examples of house-rulings as it was a form of rule zero, even after this was clarified again and again, to understand how this clarification was not only not desired, but even actively fought and ignored.<br/><br/>What you call "good rule zeroes" are, simply, another thing. Any text that say that people can change rules, by itself, is not rule zero.<br/><br/>(continue)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148871/#Comment_148871" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T14:37:06+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  2:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2008 2:46PM by Moreno R..">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/><br/>A little history recap, about things I think you already know, but I don't know if you have ever considered in this context:<br/><br/>The very first rpgs didn't have no rule zero. They had a very different thing: being games that didn't cover much apart combat, once the characters got out of the dungeon (and often when they were still inside) there were a lot of situation not covered by the rules. So what happened in these cases? The referee made an ad hoc decision, or ruling. "I want to seduce the king's daughter" "well, there is no rule about this...  well, roll against your charisma, with this big fat penality, will you?". But this happened when there wasn't already a rule about this. <br/>Add to this a social context where (1) everybody picked rules, classes, monsters, etc from a lot of sources and from all over the place, from Arduin Chronicles to Dragon articles, and (2) often the GM was the only one to have access to a lot of these sources (the GM guide, for example), and you get GMs that have a lot of control about the rules used in the game. And this by necessity, because there wasn't really any other way.<br/><br/>Well. Even in this social context, when there was every reason in the world to delegate to the GM the choices of the rules and the power to make a ruling at any time, you would be hard pressed to find text in role-playing games or publications that advocate what we today call "rule zero": the authority, given to the GM (only) by the game, to ignore at whim any rule and any roll or any results, at his discretion and without having to talk to anybody about this, "for the good of the game"<br/><br/>When we have the first texts that, at first, inch by inch, by innuendo and inference, and then more and more boldly say this? When we begin to have universal system that can be used for any possible action, when we have games playable using only the player's book, and when more and more GMs ask for more "story" and less dungeon crawlings from their players. When there is no need anymore for all that GM's control "for the good of the game", but they need it "for the good of the story".<br/><br/>It's rather disingenuous, thinking about the history of that rule, to say it wasn't used, and abused, against player's authorship. When that, really, it's its very reason of being. To help the GM against player's choices that would "hurt the story" (it's rather difficult to say seriously that it could be used "for the good of the game", intending with that the gamist part of play: making the loser win anyway to make him feel better isn't a very good way to have a good game...). When it was introduced ONLY when there was no so much need anymore of the old ad hoc rulings from the GM.<br/><br/>Do you know a lot of GM that didn't use it that way? From the way you talk about it, in concrete detail, it seems that what you are talking about is house rulings, discussed with the other people at the table. If that is rule zero, even Poker has rule zero. Every game has house rules. Or rulings for the parts not covered by the written rules, or unstated social rules. That's not Rule Zero AT ALL.<br/><br/>How many GMs I know that abused Rule Zero (if and when they used it) to stop and rein player's input, thinking that stomping would have as a result a better game? Lots. So much that I don't know even a single GM who didn't do it at least once, in my presence, playing with me, counting even one-shot at conventions. Me included. It was the "normal" way to play.

Well, look at it. REALLY look at it. No flight of fantasy, please. No romantic thought about living in another's dream (I have TV for that, thanks). No bullshit about house-rulings, we are talking about a very different thing. WHAT Rule Zero REALLY say?<br/><br/>It say:<br/><br/>1) "you don't need to talk to your friend"<br/>2) "you don't need to ask them what they want from the game"<br/>3) "you don't need to hear what they say".<br/>4) "you are the only real judge of what would be better for this game"<br/><br/>Really, are you so surprised that players left this hobby in droves, and that the railroading GM has become in practice the generic example of the category in comics and books?<br/><br/>Role-playing is a social activity. Rule Zero is an anti-social rule written for anti-social people. It's as simple like that.<br/><br/>Any text in a game that talk simply about house-rulings with the group consensus, or about ac hoc rulings for things not specified in the rules, isn't talking about it. It's not even in the same planet. And as such, as examples have no place in a discussion about rule zero, if not as examples of games without one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148881/#Comment_148881" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T15:20:25+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  3:20PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2008 3:22PM by Maddrjeffe.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, seriously... your taking this so far out of context its almost funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll rule zero says is if you dont like something change it.

I think that if you have printed poker rules that allow a dealer to call a game that<i>is</i>rule zero.</blockquote>\nOK, let's skip these argument about the "true" meaning of the "rule zero" name (I still believe that historically that name was always used to talk about the formulation  I cited above, not for the entire range of modification possible in a game - this latter interpretation would mean that every game in the world has rule zero, by the way - but this block is stopping the thread and it's not so important for my argument). Lets' call mine "the absolute formulation of rule zero" and your "the gradient formulation of rule zero". (In short: "absolute" and "gradient".<br/><br/>Do you agree that "absolute" has the problems I said, and that these problems would disappear in some "gradient" formulation, making the absolute formulation not necessary to play a rpg or house ruling it?\n<blockquote>I am sorry you played in a dysfunctional environment--but I do not believe that blaming the printed documents is a legitimate excuse or rationalization for that.</blockquote>.<br/><br/>I think you just called the entire RPG culture "a dysfunctional environment" (not I would strongly disagree with you, after all). I played with A LOT of people, in 22 years (and talked with even more players, in the real world and online), and I saw this EVERYWHERE. And judging from what people post in rpg.net every day, I think that I was luckier than most.<br/><br/>By the way, this habit of reducing every opinion to a personal limited and traumatic experience is dismissive, patronizing, and is "tactic of distraction #3" in <a href="http://veejane.livejournal.com/273317.html" rel="nofollow">this little page</a>, that I already posted after another time you did it. Please engage with my argument honestly, or not at all.<br/><br/>After all, I could say that you are strongly invested, because of you personal history, in an absolute view of personal responsibility that make very difficult for you to admit any social or cultural factor, or any peer-pressure influence, in the behavior of everyone. A position that would be really difficult to defend outside of the process of healing his own self-reliance. If it can help you seeing thing this way, good (and I can see how it would help), but please don't elevate your personal shield into a universal philosophy.<br/><br/>(a personal philosophy that would excuse even grammar or numeric errors in texts: after all, you can't blame a written document, right?)<br/><br/>I never wrote in this posts that rule zero (or, if you prefers, "the absolute formulation of rule zero") forced people to make human sacrifices in the name of the GM or something like that.  I am just saying that, as a rule to put in a social game, it's very stupid rule, and you'll be better not following it. You can't negate this, really, by saying that if you follow it, you are already damaged. No matter how many time you write it, you are simply proving my point.<br/><br/>It's a rule. In a game. It's possible to have stupid rules in a game, in your philosophy, right? Or do you really believe that it's your fault, nobody forced you, and that it's impossible to have stupid rules in game, but only stupid people who apply them?\n<blockquote>I went back to the earliest RPG I have access to: 1st edition Traveller and read pg 7 "The Referee"<br/>The last paragraph says this:\n<blockquote>The referee must settle disputes about the rules (and may use his own imagination while doing so, rather than strictly adhering to the letter of the rules).<br/></blockquote>Whether or not you consider this "rule zero" or not </blockquote>\nNot even close. it's talking about "disputes about the rules", not about changing the rules secretly on a whim.\n<blockquote>isn't my point:<i>I do</i>.

Quoting him:<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>I can't believe I'm going to do this:<br/><br/>Oh look, a list of facts! Please ignore! But Christ Almighty, I do not make this shit up. I daresay, I feel like the gainsayers are being deliberately obtuse, but I let's assume the best. Here's a random sampling of stuff you might have missed in your 17, 22, 4,000 years of gaming experience:<br/><br/>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, Dungeon Masters Guide page 110: <b>"You [The GM] do have every right to overrule the dice at any time if there is a particular course of events that you would like to have occur.</b><br/><br/>Golly, I wonder where the meme of the controlling GM started? Gee, I just don't know. That statement seems so reasonable. The GM always acts in the group's best interest. Always! He's my superhuman perfect daddy.<br/><br/>Fading Suns, 1st ed. page 209, How to Gamemaster: "<b>Feel free to change both the rules and the setting.</b>" The text then instructs GMs to kill players with a shovel if they try to get them to follow the rules: "<b>...those players who are going to want to follow every rule to the letter. The easiest way to deal with them is with a shovel...</b>" Page 210 has more gems like "<b>At least try to look like you're being fair</b>.<br/><br/>Right. Completely functional rules set that requires someone to hack it on the fly according to their whim. That never causes problems. No!<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu, 5th Ed. page 72: "<b>...the keeper can determine the matter according to personal taste and local custom, without other ramification</b>". To be fair, CoC's advice is generally pretty reasonable (it's also unsupported by actual game mechanics, but that's a discussion for another thread!).<br/><br/>All of the games talk about fun and fairness, enjoyment and entertainment, but then they break that cycle by granting one member of the group power over all of the other members of the group. It's classic power dynamics. Once you have roles of power and powerless, even the most reasonable and compassionate people slide into abuse.<br/><br/>Please ignore those facts!<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>(yes, I saved this post because I did know that somebody one day would have said to me that these rules didn't exist. It's the nature of the internet discussions, and I like to be prepared...)<br/><br/>I can add something to Luke' research:<br/><br/>From the new edition of Runequest, from Moongoose:<br/>"The Games Master, using the rules in this book as a <b>guideline</b>, <i>decides</i> what effect any actions undertaken by the Player Characters have."<br/><br/>Yes, that's NOT an advice to GM to decide on a whim. It's "only" ad advice to decide using the rules only as a "guideline". You don't even need to change any rule: after all, they are only "guidelines", you can ignore them at will...<br/><br/>From Unknown Armies (Atlas Games), 2nd edition, page 281, there is an entire subchapter named "fudging" with advice to avoid getting caught from the players, like "now of course, you don't want to fudge all the time". (the chapter deal with the fact that in UA it's the GM who keep the tally of the HP, and the players don't know how many hp they have left. So, "naturally", the GM is encouraged to fudge, to don't really count the hp left, but to decide who has played "well" and can be saved and who played with so little care for his safety that can be killed... but not, this is not "at whim", right?)<br/><br/>From Serenity RPG (Margaret Weis Production):<br/>page 5: "The GM creates the basic outline of the story that the crew will follow"<br/>page 163: "Most important tips: 1) The story is the heart of a Serenity adventure. 2) The rules serve the story, not the other way round. In other words, if it comes to a fight between story vs rules, shoot the rules.<br/><br/>Do I need to continue? I have more than 100 rpgs still to check in my library, I think I could continue with these citation all day.<br/><br/>Yes, really, I am talking about something that doesn't exist.

The closest I can come to it is this: "The GM will railroad the PCs."<br/><br/>I don't believe that being in a railroaded game--continuing to come back to it--and playing in a dysfunctional group is the result of a rule (or even due to the existence of a rule--these things can happen in any game regardless of the rule).<br/><br/><b>Also</b>: I don't believe "rule zero" is <i>necessary</i> in any way, shape or form either (I'm not sure any single rule is necessary). It can exist or not and it will have some effect on expectations or not. <br/><br/><b>Finally</b>: I'll tell you this: the kind of textual deconstruction you and Luke are engaging in here is tilting at windmills. I don't have Fading Suns or AD&amp;D 1st handy--but I do have D&amp;D 2nd, 7th Sea, Deadlands, etc. All of these games set the most important thing as "having fun" (Traveller says it is for 'mature people'--but does not say what the objective of the game is. I think this is a fair trade). <br/><br/>In the face of a legalistic argument that the GM can do whatever, it would be trivially easy for a player to point out that being railroaded (or whatever) isn't fun and that entire argument is bogus. Textual analysis of the type that you're engaging in (taking quotes out of context) is interesting but ultimately irrelevant. Even the worst of the games I have ready access to (probably Deadlands) notes that the primary goal is fun ... when railroading people ceases to be fun--as it often is--any textual argument around that is self-contradictory.<br/><br/>And if it wasn't--if the game said "railroad the game <i>whether or not it is fun</i> it would <i>still</i> fall to the individuals to continue to show up in that circumstance.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149204/#Comment_149204" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T01:08:23+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  1:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>It's pretty obvious, now, that an absolute reading in the sense you've described tosses any idea of social contract or really even "civilized behavior", so to speak, out the window.

Of course if someone is a super-picky gamer who's tolerance for a rules call they don't like (rule-zero or not) is near-zero then there will be problems (the same way that being extremely picky in other social situations causes friction--like the guy who will only eat at one kind of restaurant and demands to get his way every time). However the problems there lie with the people and the group, not the social conventions or the game rules.<br/><br/>I'll also note that it's my experience that a lot of these super-picky gamers have, historically, been identified as <i>rules lawyers</i> who drag down multiple people's fun (also, I suspect, "railroady GMs").<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149238/#Comment_149238" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T06:08:40+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  6:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would have been lovely had this thread been grounded in actual play experiences instead of meta-meta-meta discussions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149292/#Comment_149292" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T10:33:49+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 10:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed!

Curse of Knowledge.  It makes no sense to many of <i>us</i> to read the text that way, because we've all been roleplaying enough to know what works.  But people who don't have the same background we have might read it in a number of ways, including an absolutist way.  I can't think back to what learning to play was like in detailed enough fashion to suggest that any one way is more probable than another with any veracity, so I'll naively suppose them to about equally probable.  If that were approximately the case, that's a whole heap of roleplayers subscribing to the "absolutist rule zero" philosophy, at least until they figure out otherwise.  Eventually, it seems that nearly everyone reaches a non-absolutist reading, but some get there faster than others.  Some people skip the absolutist reading entirely, and thus have no idea how the text might be interpreted that way at all.  So, I'd wager that those who find this an entirely philosophical discussion either don't remember ever having played with someone who interpreted it that way, or never did.  Or, to put it another way, we're all interpreting this through the lens of our personal experiences, and coming to different conclusions.  Thus, I agree that AP is likely to put some of these comments into contexts that make them more cogent.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>The problem is when the GM's notions of "fun and fairness, enjoyment and entertainment" are at odds with someone else at the table.

It has certainly been my experience with almost every person I've roleplayed with that they are not entirely knowledgeable about their own motivations.  Many people simply don't pay much attention to them, and many others, even if they do understand themselves pretty well, have trouble articulating them.  It seems like this might make houseruling difficult no matter how the power to do so is ultimately situated.

You try a game, don't like it, you don't play it anymore. Sure, some bucks wasted but that's the risk you take in trying a new product.<br/><br/>Why do we have to keep playing a particular game?<br/><br/>Does "The GM can change any rule" suggest that since the GM has the power to make the game fun, if it's not fun then it's not the game that's failed, it's the GM that failed? The suggestion means you keep playing the same game, because the game didn't fail, it was just the GM who failed?<br/><br/>Has the text has managed to make the buck stop exclusively with the GM, and never with the game itself?<br/><br/>On reflection, I think it has. The actual play I linked to on, I think, the first page has the GM blaming herself. Actually arguing with me that her choice as GM had nothing to do with system, even though how could she be GM without system?

It's not "where the buck stop". If the buck stop, it mean that it moved before. That people talked. If the GM has to judge disagreements, it can only mean that people could disagree. You are talking, again and again, of things that have no relation to Rule Zero (or, you want to co-opt a term always used for this, if you want to use it to indicate what was always called "the referee role" instead, to avoid admitting that some GM fudge, let's call this "the very stupid instructions to the GM you find in rpg manuals that advice fudging rolls" and stay on topic).<br/><br/>Callan didn't want to talk about the Referee Role, I think. So if you want to talk about THAT, about the designation of a guy to judge rule disagreements between the players, please start another thread, OK?<br/><br/>I will answer tomorrow to the people who addressed the real issues. That are, as always:<br/>- Social Behaviors Vs Anti-social power-trips<br/>- Being trusted by the players Vs Thinking that you can deceive them because a book told you so.<br/>- Listening to the players Vs not having to listen to anyone because "you are the GM".<br/>- Having a good time together Vs Thinking that the game will suffer if anybody apart from you have a say in what matter.<br/><br/>Until I do, I think it would very useful for the remainder of this discussion to read this post I link below, and the following posts in that same thread.

Since there was only two of us, he was handling an adventuring party (about 6 characters). His group was exploring some old castle ruins, and the only standing structure was this giant tower in the middle with great iron-bound doors locked from the outside.<br/><br/>I had inside three giant skeletons, basically Hill Giant zombies that had been trapped and slowly rotted away but remained animated. My player has his guys go up and unlock the doors, which open and these three giant skeletons lumber out. The fight of the century.<br/><br/>He immediately has his cleric step forward and attempt to turn undead. I look at the chart and find out my skeletons, due to his level, are automatically destroyed. No saving throw. Nothing. My big encounter gone in a single move.<br/><br/>I immediately called for the removal of this rule. He responded with "Like Hell!" The game stopped and we argued. For a while. After about an hour, Turn Undead had changed to an aura that automatically caused damage to undead near the cleric, based on level. We kept that rule for the rest of the time we played D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I'm putting this out there both as an example of how I tried to abuse rule zero (be kind, I was about 13 at the time) and how it ended up becoming a house rule. I think most groups work it out for themselves, just like we did.<br/><br/>Oh, and when I declared an end to the Turn Undead cleric ability, I knew of no rule that allowed me to do so or told me I couldn't. <br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149875/#Comment_149875" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T18:44:11+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  6:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Michael,\n<blockquote>I'm putting this out there both as an example of how <b>I tried to abuse rule zero</b> (be kind, I was about 13 at the time) and how it ended up becoming a house rule.

Part of describing the breadth and depth of 'The GM has the right to change any rule' is to indicate that people aren't actually using it, but will say they are. This is a little rough on you to put your example in the spotlight, but it's the most clear cut case we have as yet. You cannot abuse a rule you didn't even know existed (Surely? Would any argue otherwise?)<br/><br/>What you have is a naturally forming, rough negotiation process, that you latter decided to call 'rule zero'. But it's origin isn't from rule zero at all.<br/><br/>I'm going to add the same disclaimer I've added before. Long version. There's a thing called constructive denial ( <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17334.msg188019#msg188019" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17334.msg188019#msg188019</a> ). Quoting Ron Edwards, bold by me:\n<blockquote>This "package" rests ultimately on a shared understanding and agreement about the inspirational material. <b>The group often enters into a shared denial that the "package" is constructed by them</b>, identifying their particular excitement about the material with the source itself.<br/><br/>An easy example: if my role-playing group wants to "play Star Trek," it is very likely not to be consistent with or even compatible with your role-playing group's "play of Star Trek." Yet for historical Simulationist play, both of our groups are using our interpretations as "Bibles" for play. That's the denial, right there, and as I said, it's constructive - it serves an aesthetic purpose.</blockquote>\nIn this thread people say they use rule zero/the GM has the right to change any rule, but with a somewhat rigourous examination, what they actually do shows up entirely as their own fabrication.<br/><br/>And in game, that's fine - I have no problem at all with people enjoying creative denial. That's my disclaimer. But when it doesn't stay in game, but seeps out into forum discussion about games, it's a devil of a thing!

I don't know, it depend on the kind of game, I guess. The more the game depend on cooperation and honesty (for example, many Forge narrativistic game, but not only them), the more the game would be damaged. And it depend obviously on luck: the GM, following some moronic asocial advice that tell him to fudge the results to get a game that his friends would enjoy more, WITHOUT ASKING THEM (it's for this reason that it was often said that to be a good GM you have to be a little telepathic or be able to read people as a really good con man, in "traditional" gaming. Because simply ASKING THEM would be too easy...), guess what his friends would prefer. Maybe he is lucky. Maybe he really find what they would have told him if they could have talked with him about it. Maybe his fudging isn't discovered, or they don't care about it. Maybe.  It's little like following some advice about crossing the road without looking. Maybe you will be lucky.<br/>For me? Yes. It break the game. All the time. I am really fed-up with people who think they know "how to fudge to make me enjoy the game more" (they say. Usually what they mean with that is "making me following their cool story"), people that think that I want to have them stroke my ego (by stroking their one, usually) and not to play. I don't play "traditional" rpgs anymore, I can't ignore their problem after having played better games (better for me, anyway).<br/><br/>- There is really a lot of confusion in this thread about what is really "a rule zero", with people who confuse "we can change rules" (something that you can do with every game in the world, and even with your marriage, so isn't something that you can add or take from a game) with "the GM is above the rules and can fudge them without having to talk with anyone about it".  So I will express this without using that name:  it's NEVER OK to have a rule that say "you are above the rules that everybody else follow (and, so, above the other players) and you can lie about it"<br/>Oh, I can see some case, with some very problematic player, where lying to him could be the lesser evil. But I can see it as a special circumstance, not something that can be used as a "rule".<br/><br/>But let's turn the table: a rule don't have only to "non be enough to break the game", a rule has to be USEFUL, of in the best case it's a waste of space. Can you give me a simple case, with players without strong psychological problems, where Rule Zero would be better than the alternative (discuss rules with the players and don't lie to them)?<br/><br/>next!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149923/#Comment_149923" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T23:13:47+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 11:13PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 11:15PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I was sure that it was on the "no game ever said that" position, I went and copied a lot of info on games who said exactly that,</blockquote>\nCertainly you did not.

The closest I can come to it is this: "The GM will railroad the PCs." </blockquote>\nNo.  Rule Zero is the most used weapon used by railroading GMs, but it's not the same thing. A GM could railroad (with more difficulty) even without rule zero, and rule zero is toxic to the game environment even without a railroading GM  (I made a particular example of this in a previous post in this thread: let's say that I want to play to "win", and I know that my GM can fudge rolls to make me win, "to make me enjoy the game more". It's not railroading, but I will never be sure if I really won or if he let me win.  See instead the alternative: the GM talk to me, don't fudge results, but ask me if it's OK if my PC has some sort of "death immunity". usually I would not like it, but he could convince me if he has good reasons. In this case I would know, at least, if my victory was genuine or not) <br/><br/>The discussion with you about this is very problematic, because you continued to use a definition of "rule zero" that I consider rather useless and that would not show any difference between Unknown Armies and DitV. So to avoid these semantic games I will try to answer without using the name "rule zero".<br/><br/>What is the problem, you ask, with rules that say:<br/>- that the GM is above the rules DURING THE GAME (Even without this rule, everybody is above the rules when the game stop, always, in every game. The good GM stop the game and talk with people about a necessary ad hoc decision, or about a rules change. He hear what the other players have to say about it, then make a decision as referee and start again the game. INSTEAD, this rule say to the GM that he hasn't to do any of this, that he can do anything he want without following the rules agreed with the other players, during the game)<br/>- that the GM can change any result, that he can fudge any rolls, hiding behind the screen, "for the good of the game"... without even having to ASK to the other players if that is really "good" or not...<br/>- that the GM is the only arbiter of what would be "more fun" during the game, not the group.<br/><br/>Do you really have to ask?<br/><br/>These are anti-social rules, for a kind of anti-social play for anti-social people. They substitute the social and organizative role of the GM with a solitary power trip, based not on collaboration but on tricking people.  <br/><br/>I think that this sorry derive of the role of the GM was caused, for the most part, by pre-existent social hang-ups by a lot of GMs, geeks who had difficulty to collaborate and talk to other people. So this was not CAUSED in the first place by these rules: it's the other way around, there rules were born from some real problematic social environment. But it doesn't make a lot of difference, when all these rules do is propagating that same anti-social environment to other game groups.<br/><br/>It's not some sort of "anti-social ray" that force GM to behave as assholes. All you have to do to avoid any negative effect from these rules, is simply to ignore them (and talk to the players). But it's really a good excuse for these rules saying "well, if you disregard them, they don't ruin your game"? Do you want rules like these in your game?<br/><br/>Usually, I think that the most common case is that these rules are seldom used. only the most illusionist GM fudge dice all the time, and most GM don't change rules every session. So, the damage they do is not so noticeable, and the discomfort of the players when the GM, acting without talking to them, make a blunder, is easily forgotten in a little time. But it accumulate with time. What is eroded, after a while, is the trust between players and GM.<br/><br/>And this... for what? What is the utility of these rules? Can you make me an example where using fudging, lying and calvinballing is better than trusting your players and talking to them? I can' think of any!<br/><br/>The only possible "use" that I can see, it the inflating of the GM's ego. Somebody could see this as a positive thing, pushing more people to become GMs to be "the God of the game". But It's the very last motivation I would like to see in a GM. <br/><br/>(continue)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149927/#Comment_149927" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T23:46:44+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 11:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/><br/>P.S.: \n<blockquote>the kind of textual deconstruction you and Luke are engaging in here is tilting at windmills.</blockquote>\nWhat "textual deconstruction"?

Somebody could see this as a positive thing, pushing more people to become GMs to be "the God of the game". But It's the very last motivation I would like to see in a GM.</blockquote>\nI hear tale that people use the rule to intercede when it's clear that following the letter of the rules will result in a net-negative outcome. The GM is commonly charged with facilitating the experience and the rule legitimizes them (in a variety of ways based on how it is structured) to extend their judgment from the text in various forms (house rules, spot interpretations, changing a dice roll, etc.). I think your fixation on ego is what's preventing you from seeing a lot of garden-variety positive common usage.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

the 4E DMG entitled "FUN!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last essential component of the game is fun. Its not the DM's job to entertain the players and make sure they have fun. Every person playing the game is responsible for the fun of the game. Everyone speeds the game along, heightens the drama, helps set how much roleplaying the group is comfortable with, and brings the game world to life in their imaginations. Everyone should treat each other with respect and consideration, too- personal squabbles and fights among the characters get in the way of the fun. Different people have different ideas of whats fun about D&amp;D.;   <u>Remember that the "right way" to play D&amp;D; is the way that you and your players agree on and enjoy."</u><br/>\n<br/>\nI'd say that that chunk of text does a good job of explaining the relationship that Wizards intended players and DM's to have. Not one of fiat and ill will, but one of cooperation and trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall this rule -1 maybe? I think it puts rule zero in context that seems to be missing from you original post.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets go back to that for a second...<br/>\n<br/>\n"Creating House Rules<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Dungeon Master, you wear several hats: storyteller, rules arbiter, actor, adventure designer, and writer. Some DMs like to add a sixth hat to that stack: rules designer. House rules are variants on the basic rules designed specifically for a particular DM\u2019s campaign. They add fun to your D&amp;D; game by making it unique, reflecting specific traits of your world.<br/>\n<br/>\nA house rule also serves as a handy patch for a game feature that your group dislikes. The D&amp;D; rules cannot possibly account for the variety of campaigns and play styles of every group. If you disagree with how the rules handle something, changing them is within your rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis advice can\u2019t turn you into an expert game designer - we\u2019d need more than a page for that. Instead, this is a basic introduction to the concepts behind rules design. Once you\u2019ve become familiar with these ideas, the best way to learn more about game design is to play, see what\u2019s fun and what\u2019s not, and use your discoveries to guide your own work."<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go down a paragraph into rules design 101 you can see rule -1 in place.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Think carefully about the reason for changing or adding a rule. Are you reacting to a persistant problem in your campaign, or to one specific incedent? isolated problems might be handled better in other ways.<u> More important, do the other players agree to the need for a change? You have the authority to do whatever you want with the game, but your efforts wont help if there is no group</u>."<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they go off for a few pages about how a DM needs to understand the rules he's going to change  and then give samples of a few house rule options. It also says that you should playtest your new rule and throw it out if it isn't working.<br/>\nSo, sure you can use it as a way to negate any rule in the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah it does say, you can change any rule in the book, but it also says that you might want to ask everyone and really know what your doing before you do it. And it sort of hazards a caution to DM's who do so at the expense of their players by saying do it wrong and you may find yourself without a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I think rule zero means nothing without rule -1.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150045/#Comment_150045" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:33:22+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that wizards added rule zero as a way of encouraging people to drift or tinker with the rules and as a way to ensure that someone is always playtesting and potentially improving their stuff.

Lets say its a shit box of a game, just for examples sake. WHY throw yourselves into fixing and improving someone elses mistakes? I haven't mowed my lawn for awhile - are you going to throw yourself into my mistake and improve it? I've written a badly made RPG - are you going to throw yourself into my mistake and improve it?<br/><br/>Again I'll add the simulationist disclaimer - constructive denial is one reason to keep working on a shit product, because the faults can be used as 'evidence' that what the group does to make the game good, is EXACTLY what the game is about (since 'It's all about fun' then adding good stuff MUST be part of the design). Shitty design is actually fodder for constructive denial. And again, constructive denial is fine as a play form. But if anyones still in denial while they enter this thread, it fugs things up!

Since they wrote a 3 volume + set filled it with cool ideas, illustrations and concepts and constructed a pretty tight ruleset (even if it has a few flaws) I'd say that that assumption doesn't hold water. Especially since it isn't true that your in the same exact position you were in before you buy the rpg. You have a lot of tools to have fun at your disposal, but since the game is designed in such a way that you create your characters, scenarios and modules and potentially worlds you as a player (and if you read the text above that includes DM's as players) are responsible for the fun. Thats pretty much a fact. Wizards can't play D&amp;D; for you. If you think you can do better, by all means go ahead and don't spend any money on it. Thats your prerogative as a consumer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second assumption is that because of the above its basically impossible for the game to have any faults.<br/>\nI think that assumption is wrong because the game does have some faults. It would be ridiculous to think it didn't. But lot of those faults are going to be predicated on the tastes of people playing the game. Sure there might be some mechanical issue or two... but the mechanical stuff is solvable by errata its still to early to know if it will be though. For everything else they tell you to play around with the rules and change what you don't like so you can have fun. Im pretty sure that you don't like that aspect of the game, but a lot of people do and I wish you and Moreno would acknowledge that those people have a right to that preference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Third assumption is that if a game comes out it has to be perfect or that the game is a shitbox. Im sorry but I cant really tell from your post if you dont like D&amp;D4;'s design or if your positing a hypothetical about all bad games.  I'll address the first one, because frankly its easier and because I don't think its a bad game. Not to your taste maybe, but not altogether bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all nothings perfect, maybe you want better poison rules, or want to fiddle with the feats or actions to avoid using a battlemat or think you need lots more stuff on dehydration and starvation or whatever why not add that if dying of thirst is a real concern in your game. Drop the alignment system altogether if you want. These are matters of taste. But also there are some pretty genius people tinkering with games, today's home rule might be tomorrows D&amp;D; addition because its just too awesome. Action points are a good example.<br/>\nWhen I was at camp nerdly I saw people actively tinker with games even though they happened to be awesome (the games... although come to think about it the people were too) I wouldn't be surprised to see Remi's miniseries hack for PTA get added to a later edition of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy improve it? Because one day we may see duel of wits in D&amp;D;, or circles or something no ones thought of or worked out yet. I think thats reason enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I think something is getting lost in this thread on an ESL level because the written tone of a few posts is causing my spider senses to go off.

Say it is 1992 and you really want to play some gothy vampire thing.  I believe you have exactly one choice on the commercial market.  (I expect to be corrected on this by some utterly-obscure vampire competition, but whatever).<br/><br/>So, you can drift the White Wolf game, or you can make your own game.<br/><br/>Both are good choices, but you're basically saying that if you have to change 1 thing in Vampire, you may as well scrap the game.

Just to note my selfish interest in this, it's because if someone finds it useful, they may latter post something in regards to it that I didn't think of, thus I get something without having to think of it first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mrigashirsha" title="Mrigashirsha"><img alt="Mrigashirsha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mrigashirsha">Mrigashirsha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163296/#Comment_163296" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T11:58:31+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 11:58AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Corley<br/><br/>When we played regular ole red box D&amp;D, there were rules arguments. Well and good. What I find interesting is that while we, in our 7th-9th grade male way, were completely obsessed with both following the rules to the letter and simultaneously finding loopholes to demonstrate our cleverness/prowess, we valued being able to find and cite the appropriate rule as being the ending of an argument. In other words, the authority whose view we were seeking was the designer's view. None of us asked, "Well, between rule interpretation A and rule interpretation B, what is the best one to select for our group in this moment?" It was always "between rule interpretation A and rule interpretation B, which one is clearly the most supported by the game text."<br/><br/>Yet this was problematic for us for a very simple reason: it was clear that the designers did not follow the same rules they gave to us.  D&amp;D modules were rife with characters with too many hit points, too low an armor class, special magic powers that broke the rules for magic powers, permanent effects in dungeons that violated the rules of what permanent magic effects did, or worse, what the rules told us permanent magic effects were like in the setting (really important! hard to set up!)  We became increasingly frustrated with what we perceived as inconsistencies in the rules that we were constantly seeking to find some authority in. And if we hadn't been 7-9th grade boys and therefore<i>fucking morons</i>we would have seen that this was only to be expected when dealing with a property that was worked on by multiple people over the course of many years, and even when it was the same person, they clearly refined their designs and changed their views of what the best sort of rule was, as you might expect any human being on god's green earth to do if you thought about it for five fucking seconds.<br/><br/>Faced with the knowledge that the designer's intent A) didn't matter, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> was stupid, C) changed all the time, there was really no choice. We couldn't just keep searching the rules for the rule we wanted. Someone would have to decide. The game identified an authority, the GM. This kicked it back to the social level for a while. ("Young JD's games are like this, whereas Young Brian's games are like that.") Eventually we started to work out criteria for when a rules interpretation, patch, or replacement was a good idea or a bad idea, usually based around the needs of the individual group, their preferences, their<i>fucking schedules</i>, their experience level, their comfort level, etc. And that is how I eventually interpreted "change the rules if you want!" rules - to push people who had not been as far down our road as we had further down the road.<br/><br/>So that is why "rule zero" is a no-brainer to me (godawful though the piece of jargon may be.) All rules are rule zero. Everyone chooses either to apply a rule, mis-apply it, or ignore it, at every moment of play, and it's the choice that controls the game, not the written rule.</blockquote>\nI don't have a lot to add, I just wanted to note that Jason's account here is <i>exactly</i> like mine, and that this kind of thing was a strong influence on my game writing. (Perhaps most fully in the chargen chapter for Dark Ages: Vampire.) And yes, to those of you wondering, questions like "Do I actually have permission to change this rule?" actually do arrive fairly regularly at game publishers. White Wolf was routinely getting several a month when I was there, and I hear from friends at Catalyst Labs that they keep getting them to this day about Shadowrun. <br/><br/>In fact, come to think of it, I do have something to add...<br/><br/>Rule zero and its kin are <i>responses to preexisting experiences</i>. I'm not sure how much that reality has ever penetrated into story-gaming discussion of them. They aren't primarily manifestos created as what seem like good ideas on their own - they're things put together to clarify principles that game writers thought were as obvious as most story gamers would find them, but turned out not to be. The context of dealing with existing player and GM concerns, ranging from the very sensible through the simply naive to the outright weird, strongly shapes the way such principles are formulated, positioned, and modified (or left alone).<br/><br/>This isn't surprising, of course. Most efforts at formulating principles have some element of reaction in them. And the field of gamerdom is broad enough for wildly different experiences to be all be common enough to have inspired someone to try and establish their reactions as a foundation for new effort that will escape the inspiring problems. But it can be easy to look at a response to a problem you've never had and think "But does that ever happen?", even when the answer turns out to be "Yup!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6620/text-granting-the-gm-the-right-to-change-rules-the-breadth-and-depth/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6620/text-granting-the-gm-the-right-to-change-rules-the-breadth-and-depth">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6620/text-granting-the-gm-the-right-to-change-rules-the-breadth-and-depth/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6620/text-granting-the-gm-the-right-to-change-rules-the-breadth-and-depth/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6620/text-granting-the-gm-the-right-to-change-rules-the-breadth-and-depth/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6620%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6620%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
