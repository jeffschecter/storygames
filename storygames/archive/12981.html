I came to the conclusion that we<sup>*</sup> need to adopt this attitude about the question:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs197.ash2/46042_425801460247_603770247_5509334_799370_n.jpg"/><br/>(graffiti in my old home town of Northampton, MA)<br/><br/>Where gender = the idea of GMs. <br/><br/>So, instead of figuring out whether games have GMs or not, or how much GMliness they have, we have to break out of the thinking structure that says every game either has a GM, or doesn't. Instead, we should refer to how the game apportions responsibilities and authority.<br/><br/>For example, the role of personifying the antagonism is separable from being the rules adjudicator is separable from being the social organizer is separable from making mechanical or strategic choices for the antagonist is separable from the person hosting the game night is separable from who says how the plot of the game is structured, ad (quasi-) infinitum.<br/><br/>Take a look at <i><a href="http://galileogames.com/how-we-came-to-live-here/" rel="nofollow">How We Came to Live Here</a></i> by Brennan Taylor as an example. There are two GM-like roles, the inside player and the outside player. When dealing with conflicts internal to the village, the inside player makes all mechanical and strategic decisions for the scene, but the outside player plays the first (and potentially only) non-hero character introduced in the scene. Personifying the antagonism has been split (partially) from making mechanical choices for the antagonist(s).<br/><br/>Now take a look at <i><a href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">Shock: Social Science Fiction</a></i> by Joshua AC Newman. Personification of and mechanical decisions made for the antagonist are made by a single person (the Antagonist), but the world (through Ownership of Shocks and Issues) and the plot structure (by defining how each scene begins, getting last choice on Intent for a conflict, setting the story goal) is heavily influenced by the Protagonist and by Audience.<br/><br/>Finally, take a look at my own game, <i><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a></i>. Being The Authority is almost entirely about ensuring that the game's structure goes as it should and, most importantly, about personifying the antagonism in the most frustrating, maddening, unwise-actions-inducing way possible. No one can really make mechanical or strategic decisions for The Authority, except inasmuch as taking action as The Authority in fiction constitutes strategic action. And even then, the strategy The Authority is working with is a meta-strategy about how to fuck with the emotions of players and, through them, their characters. The Authority isn't trying to win, or to beat the clique. It's not possible to, nor is it what's called for.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Note that, crucially, I'm not suggesting that all games that refer to GMs be publicly burned, or even publicly scorned. This isn't about a battle over whether GMed, GMful, or GMless games are best. I just think that we should really move beyond this notion of there being a metric based on how GMed a game is. It's about qualities, not categories. Ask "What does this game <i>do</i> with authority and responsibility," not "What category does it fit inside of" or "What categories do we need to make to fit this?"<br/><br/>I'm someone in favor of tagging things with appropriate descriptors than categorizing things, generally. Maybe this is just an example of that.<br/><br/><sup>*</sup> When I say "we," I mean me, and you if you want to.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292504/#Comment_292504" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:46:29+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, what a coincidence!

But those two are the GM, acting in concert.<br/><br/>Perhaps a better example is something like <i>Fiasco</i>. When I've played that, there hasn't been a GM figure. And, fascinatingly, it works without worrying about authority. I'm sure there are rules behind authority, but I don't need to worry about what they are.<br/><br/>So I don't know. I'd like to talk about how authority is distributed. I'd like to talk more about the GM role. But I'm unsure about clever variations on the GM role.

So in Medical Hospital, one guy is always responsible for assigning surgical procedures to everyone at the table. Somebody else has the job of monitoring attention levels and calling for breaks. These are fixed responsibilities (part of the system, one procedural and one social) tied to roles drenched in melodramatic color, and they can change hands effortlessly.<br/><br/>Both of these things have to be done, and the normal setup would be for the GM to handle them, or, in an egalitarian equal-authority GMless setup, for everyone to handle them. <br/><br/>I think it will be interesting and fun (and effective) to just hand those responsibilities to the people who want them. Medical Hospital is going to be sort of a baby step in this direction.<br/><br/>EDIT: Graham, you are so contrary.

You're cramming things that exist into the wild into boxes they don't really fit in.<br/><br/>Because The Authority in <i>Misspent Youth</i> is not clearly, clearly a GM in every sense of the word. Especially not in the traditional sense. In fact, I've had lots of questions in recent interviews asking why I chose to do the GM role in this strange way, so it's not just me who thinks this. The Authority doesn't have a mechanically adversarial role with the YOs, does not come up with a story ahead of time, doesn't come up with the structure of events, doesn't control where the story is going, doesn't create antagonist figures, etc. All of these things are part of what most people understand the GM role to contain, but are absent in my game.<br/><br/>It's not about creating clever variations. It's about designing the game to suit the purpose you intend for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292562/#Comment_292562" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T10:23:13+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 10:23AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think it will be interesting and fun (and effective) to just hand those responsibilities to the people who want them.

But Rob has a card, and he'll be watching that much harder because he's got a little reminder flag. So if I'm the guy who points out that we're lagging, that's totally OK, and I don't stop caring about our group because Rob's got the card. But ... Rob's got the card, so it's covered.

I hope Jason can make it work, still, and if anyone can do it, he can.<br/><br/>When Shreyas, Thomas, and I were talking about Four Nations, the idea was that each player took on the role of one of the great oral storytellers of four different ethnic groups and they've gathered together to tell the great epic that unites their peoples, the equivalent of the Illiad or the Sagas.  The design conceit was that each ethnic group had  completely different but somewhat compatible storytelling tradition.  For example, maybe one told stories with masks, where another used shadow puppets, while another used a brush, bell, fan, and bowl of water.  And the different traditions would interact with each other, during the storytelling process, both directly and indirectly, based on the rules governing individual traditions and the larger rules governing the telling of the epic.<br/><br/>So something like that allows you to draw completely on the needs of the game, because they are so far outside normal conceits like GM and player.  You wouldn't even think of issues like "what are the normal GM responsibilities and how do we distribute them to these storyteller figures?"  What?  That SO doesn't matter!  Instead you start with, "Okay, how do the People of the Fated Threads tell stories?"  And you'd develop four separate storytelling styles and then, in playtesting, you'd watch for the interactions between them and make adjustments until you found a near-synergy that still allowed for occasional disruptions or uncomfortable interactions that players would have to figure out how to resolve (those issues of intercultural interaction being part of the fun of the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292584/#Comment_292584" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T10:56:40+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 10:56AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>EDIT: Graham, you are so contrary</blockquote>\nThat is probably true.

In my group we haven't found that these activities interfere extensively with focusing on playing a character\u2014or, to be more specific, we found that concentrating them all on one person caused them to interfere with each other for that person, more than dividing them up caused them to interfere with characters. The method evolved out of the GM growing stressed and overloaded from trying to direct, set design, cast, stage manage, fight choreograph, and do makeup all at the same time, and other players jumping in to pinch-hit for him or her in accordance with their various strengths while simultaneously playing their characters. Afterwards we looked at what happened and thought, hey, we all found ourselves less stressed when we did that\u2014let's just start out doing it next time.<br/><br/>Does that explanation clarify things any more?

Each kind of role-play (framing a scene, introducing a character, introducing a plot twist, role-playing someone in the scene, providing adversity, whatever) has a "cost" associated which causes depletion of the resource.  Lower resource does mean that you have less remaining "story power" but isn't hopefully avoided because when any two players bottom out, it all shuts down and having husbanded your points early means you had opportunity to play along instead of more opportunity to control things at the end.  Role-play duties like monitoring enthusiasm/energy levels, bringing ice, arranging the game, etc. could also have a role.

The Uni economy could be used as a starting point - "role-playing an antagonist" - 1 coin to take control, n points to add coins, etc could easily add up to 10;  "introducing a plot twist" - the various characters and components and traits in the plot twist could easily add up to 55.<br/><br/>Some kinds of GMing I might want to get "paid" for somehow.  If I'm providing adversity instead of getting to play my own character, for example.  (And Uni kind of does this by giving you a coin profit when you initiate complications.)  Or being caterer.  (How about you bring snacks or drink - you get coins!) <br/>Or knowing a complex rules system.
