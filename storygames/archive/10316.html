I pride myself on running great games. But 4E has been very problematic and unreliable. In the end, I think I\u2019ve been playing it wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is probably not a favorable opinion but I believe combat in 4E over the long term, especially at higher levels to be long, tedious, and unreliably fun. The grind is increasingly a problem. And its tight design is, at least mathematically, overstated. Having served many months as a playtester, played over 60+ sessions, and worked closely with the underpinning math behind it, I believe there are many problems. But I may be playing it wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is I fell for the hype. I believed the game should be played less as a toolkit game and more as is, out of the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading one of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://chattydm.net/2009/08/28/friday-chat-the-issues-of-combat-length-in-dd-4e/" rel="nofollow">Chatty GMs recent blog post, especially the comments</a>, I suspect D&amp;D; 4E might me an amazing game if you... and this may sound weird... don't play it as a standard combat game where your objective is to defeat the other side by lowering their hit points. And fudge or ignore many of the rules as needed in play to support your style of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did end up witnessing several amazing games of 4E at Gencon and everyone changed the rules or procedures to fit their group or situation. Even further, several groups decided to abandon killing monsters all together. Instead they focused on objectives in combat, and when those objectives were completed, the combat ends, regardless of how many hit points everyone has. This wasn't how people were playing in the RPGA rooms. But those games seemed less interesting to me personally. And I heard several of those games would often run past the 4 hour timeslot because they couldn't fit everything in playing with the rules as is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally prefer not having to customize a game. I have a lot of games to choose from. But for a lot of people, D&amp;D; is the easiest way to find players. And many people love to customize games (and many people love it the way it is). I think sometimes people don't give themselves enough credit when they make 4E awesome by changing it (and I don't think 4E should take the credit for those changes). In some ways, talking about 4E is difficult. Like many previous versions of D&amp;D.; Your D&amp;D; isn\u2019t the same as someone else\u2019s D&amp;D.; I might talk about my problems with skill challenges and someone else might be talking about how great they are and we could be playing something different (even before you add in what a huge different who playing makes).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think by trying to play 4E as is (which is a difficult concept to begin with given the multitude of books, options, errata, organized play rules, access to digital for pay tools), I was missing on a lot of its potential. And maybe even missing the point. I wanted it to be Dogs in the Vineyard (in terms design elegance) and it isn't. And I think hype and expectations were part of the problem. I do wish the game was presented differently to cut down confusion. But it is what it is. Or at least that\u2019s my take at the moment.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229322/#Comment_229322" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:28:23+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:28PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 1:29PM by nemomeme.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of people are playing it out-of-the-box and having a good time with it.

Several people were surprised when I pointed out the rules they drifted. Which helps create a disconnect when people talk about their play experiences online. Even if you wanted to play 4E as written, it would be difficult.

This is brilliant. Tell me more of what you saw, NOW.<br/><br/>So, when I lived in Japan, I would sometimes go to game meets at the army base at Camp Zama and the like in between meetups in Tokyo and Gunma. In the Army, there were lots of gamers, and a LOT of minis gamers: Warhammer, the post-apoc skirmish one (I forget the name now), etc. On a whim, as there was downtime before my next Real RPG Event, I got pulled into (and willingly went with) a Mordheim pickup game.<br/><br/>Now, I had played Warhammer and similar games before: You have one side, the other has another side, and you kill each other until one is left standing or one side concedes defeat. I just didn't care for the time investment in it.<br/><br/>But Mordheim blew my mind: It was a small skirmish game you could play over and over (about 4 skirmishes in the time I've seen regular 1-game Warhammer games go down), and ALL of the scenarios in the book - save one (IIRC) - were all goal-focused events that ended when a particular goal was completed: Get the three gems. Get the gem and bring it back to your side. Take out X number of opponents. Stuff like that. For some reason, I found this far more compelling - and had my gears firing - than "kill all the other dudes". A lot more strategy was possible, etc.<br/><br/>I never thought of taking that Mordheim approach to D&amp;D encounters, I really hadn't. That's an excellent thought, and will think on it more.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229361/#Comment_229361" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T14:18:52+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  2:18PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>But even DitV has had subsequent tweaks that make it play better, and I happen to know you use them to good effect.

Pg. 42 is actually what sold me on 4E, because it's a highly elegant evolution of the stunting rules Mearls made in Iron Heroes (which I played the hell out of).<br/><br/>I agree with the general grind issues of the game- if I ran a serious 4E set, I'd probably do two things:<br/>1) Go with the 75% HP rule a lot of folks are doing for the monsters<br/>2) Never run one of their pre-made adventures/modules<br/><br/>The second one because all the fun in combat happens when you set up locations with tons of threats, hazards, and things to stunt with ("Roll barrel down stairs! = ranged attack vs. Reflex defense, does X damage, and stun!") - and so far all I've seen from their modules is pretty lame.  From my Iron Heroes days we'd have fights on moving wagons, multilevel construction sites, on the top of statues, and pretty much every action movie possibility you can imagine.

They say what they wanna do and the two of you negotiate on what skill they use, just like with a normal skill.  Then alter the scenario based on the result (again, just like with a normal skill) and then go to the next player.  Repeat.  The key here is to lay out the scenario.  If one player uses his Athletics to run down the hallway to get away from the pursuing manticore, tell the next player, "Okay, y'all are down the hallway now but that manticore is still closing.  The way is blocked by a bunch of barrels, and you hear voices down the way that might be guards.  Jed the Fighter is also falling behind and hurt.  What do you wanna do to improve your situation?"  . . . basically, give them a lot of hooks to hang skills on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to develop skill challenges organically - don't tell the players it's a skill challenge.  Just present the scenario and keep track of their use of skills until they reach the pre-determined number of failures and successes.  If one player is hogging the action, prod the others - "Okay, so Jed is moving those boulders but it's going slow.  You wanna try to help or do you just stand there?"  At the very least, they'll often try to use Perception to stand watch, or might try an aid other.  Then you mark down experience and they don't even realize the skill challenge was there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't say how higher-level fights go in D&amp;D.  We haven't played any game past 5th or 6th level.  Most of our fights tend to go quick because we tend to populate them with minions.  When I run fights, I also make sure there's a good Defense-to-Attack Bonus ratio in the characters' favor so they can at least land hits, making it feel like less of a grind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the 75%-50% reduction in hp of all baddies idea proposed here. One problem that has emerged in my games is that the players are often incredulous at how resilient crappy-seeming bad guys tend to be in fights.  That's how I felt as well when I played - "Good gravy, this orc has 60 hp?  And I have 30?   Argh!". . . just made me feel like a tool instead of a hero, y'know?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem with D&amp;D is opposite the original poster:  it's TOO elegant.  It's TOO balanced.  I remember fondly the days when players pulled zany stunts to give themselves edges over impossible odds.  Now every hero does an average of X points of damage every round no matter what skills they pull into play - the difference is flavor, and you can only expand or reduce your impact so far.  It sometimes makes 4E feel like Progress Quest, and makes me wanna reintroduce house rules like 20-20-hit = insta-kill just to add back that sense of wowness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also makes me wanna have all the bad guys be zombos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229397/#Comment_229397" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:43:56+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Is it too thread-drifty to ask you what tweaks you mean?

This is brilliant. Tell me more of what you saw, NOW.<br/><br/>I had lunch with 2 of these DMs. They play very much the way I ran 4E for my friends from high school. Which were some of the best games of 4E I\u2019ve ever ran. But you really need the players to be on board with this style of play and be ok with some of their choices in character creation possibly being invalidated because of the changes. I run for a lot of people. And a lot of people don\u2019t want these changes for understandable reasons. I\u2019ll talk more about this when I respond to John Harper. <br/><br/>Over lunch, we discussed what changes we made to make 4E work for us. Primarily making combats objective based, fast, and less predictable. <br/><br/>Between the 3 of us, we highlighted: <br/><br/>- Creating objectives that required movement, skill use, eliminating or protecting specific targets.<br/>- Setting time limits (at the end of the allotted time the game ends, or you lose healing surges every round till you complete the objective, or more monsters start flooding the encounter.<br/>- Eliminating the idea of encounters being a single combat.<br/>- Eliminating milestones.<br/>- Merging separate combat encounters into 1 mega encounter. Say you normally play 3 separate combats in separate locations. Instead we lay out the entire dungeon or area and allow the players to move anywhere at the risk of triggering additional combats. This way they can sneak around and decide what order to fight each combat or complete each objective at the risk of triggering multiple combats. But since you don\u2019t have to fight to the death, you can always maneuver away from combats towards your objectives.<br/>- Since there are no longer separate combats, you gain action points, refresh encounter powers, and may use healing surges freely when you complete objectives. <br/>- Non elite or solo monsters flee when bloodied or you get to make repeated intimidate checks as a minor action till they flee. <br/>- Removing combo effects that slow down the game like weakened and insubstantial.<br/>- Limiting the use of effects that rob or cancel player\u2019s actions.<br/>- Potential uses of stunts from the DMG are called out on the map. Suggested interactive elements are drawn in different colors or placed as moveable pieces. <br/>- Stunts can modify existing attacks. Instead of choosing to use a stunt or attack, you can use a stunt to improve your attacks. A bonus to hit, additional damage, increased range, or adding an effect (knock targets prone, ongoing damage, immobilize). <br/>- Expending Healing Surges for re-rolls (not additional actions like Action Points). <br/>- Avoiding monsters with high defenses and low damage. Or lowering their defenses and increase their damage.<br/>- Monsters may sacrifice hit points for additional actions once per turn (solos or elites can do this twice per turn). For example, they reduce their hit points by 20 to gain an Action Point that they can use immediately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229590/#Comment_229590" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T08:51:05+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  8:51AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>This thread has opened my eyes to a new horror: People play deathmatch D&amp;D? Just a bunch of fights to the death, over and over?<i>For reals?!</i></blockquote>\nIt\u2019s the way many people play in RPGA which is far larger than the Story Games community. It\u2019s how many people learned to play from the modules Wizards released to support 4E. And it\u2019s often what character creation rewards in 4E. <br/><br/>This is not my preferred way to play. I\u2019d rather play the way I outlined above. But many people I\u2019ve encountered don\u2019t prefer that. Actually, that\u2019s not true. Often they really enjoy it in small bursts. But not as a standard. People spend a lot of time optimizing their character builds. It\u2019s like magic the gathering. It\u2019s the type of play 4E rewards. They build an optimal deck, buy splat book after splat book looking for advantageous combos, and want it validated when they sit down to play. The type of play I outlined above is dramatic and exciting but can also invalidate many of their character build options. Combats are often as long as they are to give everyone a chance to use a wide array of powers and tactical options while reducing and challenging their resources. It\u2019s not surprising given the sheer number of people who love tactical card, war, and computer games. But many of these same people love roleplaying. It\u2019s not an issue of roleplaying vs. not roleplaying. <br/><br/>I often feel a bit of whiplash visiting the Story Games community. I like it here. But it doesn\u2019t represent the masses (which isn\u2019t a bad thing by any means). I think I\u2019m also in a different position than most. Because I organize medium size game events, travel a lot (or did), visit gamers all over the world, have connections to many organized play groups in Paizo and Wizards, I get to play with lots of different people. Easily 200 different people in a given year. Probably more. May of our individual gaming groups don\u2019t represent the bigger picture. <br/><br/>For example, my old group in high school loved the changes I described above. Hell, I\u2019d go as far and say many of those changes are fair game by some of the advice in the DMG. But it violates many of the expectations players have from the PHB, organized play groups, and modules. So outside of my old group, many people were not interested in perceived drastic changes to the game. Hell, even proposing that some monsters run away when bloodied is treated with disdain if that isn\u2019t specified in their MM description. <br/><br/>As an aside, it\u2019s amazing how different our perceptions are. It\u2019s easy to imagine we are all on the same page and it\u2019s very interesting to see where we aren\u2019t. But that\u2019s also awesome. Keeps things exciting! More of a reason to share experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229593/#Comment_229593" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T09:00:04+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  9:00AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, some very cool tips in there.

That you've uncovered this situation still exists in the world of 4E is fascinating, but not really that surprising.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229678/#Comment_229678" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T13:45:32+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  1:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suggested "objective based combat" to my friend, and while he was of course interested, he pointed out that if a combat goes to short, say from quickly accomplishing a goal, his players are disappointed.  Since it is over more quickly than normal, they feel as though they accomplished less.  People are weird.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
