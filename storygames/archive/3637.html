Each has four edges.  Each edge corresponds to a category of thing - character, location, motivation, or situation.  Everybody writes down one of the four, whatever they are interested in, in the appropriate edge of their card.  Then rotate!  Fill in an edge of the next card.  Rotate until all the edges are filled in.  <br/><br/>Now there's some system for assigning order, but it resolves and somebody slaps down an index card they like - any card.  The person on their left adds a card, but here's the deal - it has to match up situation-location or character-motivation.  Then the next person adds another card to finish the set, and you've got one of each, like this:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games//medical_hospital/images/mh_card_idea.jpg"/><br/><br/>So in this example, we've got a case of mistaken identity, the cafeteria, nurse Bontus, and revenge!  Sounds good to me.  <br/><br/>Possible ideas:<br/>Each time an element is used, you give it a hash mark.  When every element has a hash mark, maybe the session is over.  <br/>Hash marks add mojo somehow when elements are reincorporated.  <br/>"Character" edge is for the person you want to play, and the player of the character built into the scene frames it.<br/><br/>Index cards are cool because they are visual, have space for notes, and are easily portable from session to session.  Being asymmetrical means that matching elements up is easy, but you still have lots of interesting choices.  Going <i>second </i>lets you define the nature of the scene very well.  In creation, you can focus on what's important to you - situation, characters, whatever.  <br/><br/>I'd value your thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81633/#Comment_81633" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T06:45:05+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  6:45AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn your brain, Jason!

I haven't been able to find much more about it, although I think it was created by  Francis Debyser. I stole the idea for my game Disappeared but using ordinary playing cards. Disappeared has worked well in playtests because its all about pointing towards the solution in the center of the pattern but you end up with motives next to witnesses next to secrets etc. I like how the index card creates automatically and almost grammatically matches and also causes the fruitful voids Daniel noticed. For situation generation that's really nice.<br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h244/markvalli/cartesnoires.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81649/#Comment_81649" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T07:21:51+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  7:21AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games//medical_hospital/images/mh_card_idea_2.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81655/#Comment_81655" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T08:01:31+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  8:01AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2007 8:01AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, do you have a copy of Disappeared available?  <br/><br/>If the four elements on a card are interrelated and relevant, than you don't have to necessarily note discrete interactions (like I did above).

All the players arrange themselves in a semicircle facing the audience.  They solicit a word, and then begin free associating.  Each word is explicitly influenced only by the previous word, so no general theme necessarily emerges, although an emotional tone often does.  The goal is to return, after an elliptical excursion, to the original word.  So, as a simple example for the word "clay":<br/><br/>Clay ... pottery ... wine ... drunk ... homeless ... cigar ... relaxation ... tennis ... clay!<br/><br/>As in scene work, one of the goals is to trust your partners - even if you don't understand the jump from on word to another, you must believe it is the best possible jump and work from there.  If you didn't know that tennis is sometimes played on clay courts, that leap might seem incongruous, for example.  In practice, it is common for players to make a word arc that returns to the original phrase and departs in a different direction three times.  This free association leads to an wide array of thoughts, feelings, and images that will be used as inspiration for scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81719/#Comment_81719" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T10:34:09+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 10:34AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow Jason, I really like where you are going here.<br/><br/>I've been using index cards as character sheets in <i>The Naked City</i>, but they just sit on the table and it's difficult to find a way to interconnect them to show relationships or conflict.  But the players in that game take the role of different characters depending on the Act I/II/III of the story, so I've already jumped into that pool called distributed character ownership...and the water is fine.<br/><br/>I think your very first card in the upper left is the cleanest and easiest to parse.  Perhaps keeping track of too much info on the cards will make them less intuitive.<br/><br/>My gut instinct is that you can get more mileage not by writing more on the cards, but by keeping them simple and finding more interesting ways for the cards to work together.  Imagine a larger group of those cards together, perhaps 8-12 of them.  That is going to create some interesting intersections that a GM or player can grab for their scene.  A player might have the opportunity to move or swap cards around during their "turn", which would upset the apple cart and perhaps create a new group of interesting conflicts.<br/><br/>If you are going to use hash marks, it might be interesting to mark the edge of cards, the very intersection that is used for a scene.  So given the "case of mistaken identity, the cafeteria, nurse Bontus, and revenge!", you would mark the lower right corner of the upper left card (right between 'Revenge' and 'A case of mistaken identity').<br/><br/>And thinking about this some more, it would be cool if there were some catalyst to allow someone to move a card, since it will change a character's motivation among other things.  <br/><i><br/>Ex: Earlier, Nurse Bontus was out for revenge.  But after she cornered the man she thought left her on the altar and found that he was his secret twin, that card got moved.  And now the Nurse is on a moonlit balcony with the twin, and there's lust in her eyes.  But her sister "must never find out!"</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81723/#Comment_81723" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T10:40:57+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 10:40AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, those are great ideas, Chris.

If you want to keep Shelley Bontus away from lust for some reason, you've got to gamble that Chris isn't going to stab you in the face and move her card or pray that she doesn't get invoked.  Thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The idea of noting intersections rather than individual elements is also intriguing.  In that case you'd have three per scene rather than four, but they'd have a wider range of potential impact (whatever the impact is).

If a player wants to swap Shelley's card with the homeless dude to get to the motivation that is (presumably) next to the homeless dude, then suddenly the latter is out for revenge!  So you force players to basically f**k with the story in order to get the "right" setup they prefer for a scene.  Which is gold.<br/><br/>2. The motivation that is on the same card as a character is basically their antithesis since they can never line up next to it.  So the crazy homeless dude can *never* be lustful, and Shelley can *never* be ambitious.  Accidental brilliance, perhaps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81729/#Comment_81729" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T10:58:27+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 10:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I would move cards between scenes -- but you could easily have card-shifting as the mechanical result of whatever happens in the scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81741/#Comment_81741" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T11:26:57+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:26AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So going back to Jason's original example, Shelley's obviously the star of the scene.

When the good doctor and hobo are introduced, the player who introduces them can give them a motivation by adding a card.

This involves writing out some information on index cards.  Give everybody one - 3x5\xe2\u20ac\x9d blank cards are perfect.  <br/><br/>Write down a character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s name along left (short) edge of an index card.  A name can also be a description or title, like \xe2\u20ac\u0153the homeless guy\xe2\u20ac\x9d or \xe2\u20ac\u0153the head resident\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  You can add a personal name later if it becomes necessary.  Pass the card to the left.  <br/><br/>Write down something the character wants along the right (short) edge of the index card you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been handed.  A character can want an object (\xe2\u20ac\u0153Dr. Connoly\xe2\u20ac\u2122s secret file\xe2\u20ac\x9d), an abstract concept (Revenge!), or an emotion (Joy).  If you pick another character as your character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s want, that character will be treated like an object in scenes where they are involved as a want \xe2\u20ac\u201c it will be about who controls or influences them rather than what their own goals and motivations are.  Pass the card to the left.<br/><br/>Write down, along the top (long) edge of the index card you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been handed, an interesting location where the character would be likely to be found.  These should  be locations in the hospital or places where hospital staff would be likely to hang out.  They can be large (\xe2\u20ac\u0153The children\xe2\u20ac\u2122s wing\xe2\u20ac\x9d or \xe2\u20ac\u0153The Wagon Wheel Saloon\xe2\u20ac\x9d) or small (\xe2\u20ac\u0153A forgotten storage locker\xe2\u20ac\x9d).  Pass the card to the left.<br/><br/>Finally, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been handed a fourth index card with a character, a location, and something the character wants.  The final edge, the bottom, is reserved for a situation the character will need to confront.  Situation should be something engaging, not too specific, and end in an exclamation point.  Think melodrama, and call on the three elements already in place to inspire you.  Good examples might be \xe2\u20ac\u0153Mistaken identity!\xe2\u20ac\x9d, \xe2\u20ac\u0153She must never find out!\xe2\u20ac\x9d or \xe2\u20ac\u0153Vicious dog on the loose!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>When you have finished this, you will have as many cards as you have players,  and each has a character, a location, a motivation, and a situation.  <br/><b><br/>LOOSEY-GOOSEY METHOD</b><br/><br/>Once you are comfortable with the regular method, feel free to try it less scripted  \xe2\u20ac\u201c simply add one element to each card rather than adding specific element types in sequence.  That way, if you really want Dr. Mulligan to show up, you can add her as a character (or a want!) to multiple cards.  You might like this better, or you might not.  Either way is fine.<br/><br/><b>HOW TO MAKE A SCENE</b><br/><br/>[How to determine who initiates a scene is TBD]<br/><br/>If you are the person initiating a scene, look over all the cards and pick one that contains stuff you like.  Put this card in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>If you are sitting to the immediate left of the person initiating a scene, you get to add the second card.  You can take any remaining card and match it up to the one already in play.  You do this by placing it above, below, or to one side of the first card, matching either a situation to a location or a character to a want.  You can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t turn cards sideways to match a character to a location or a situation to a want.  <br/><br/>If you are sitting immediately to the left of the person who just laid down a second card, you get to finish the scene elements.  If there is already a character/want match, you get to match situation and location anywhere you want, on either of the two cards already in play.  If there is already a situation/location match, you get to do the opposite \xe2\u20ac\u201c decide on a character/want match.<br/><br/>Once you have three cards in an \xe2\u20ac\u0153L\xe2\u20ac\x9d shape, you have the four elements that make up the scene.  Make a note of these by putting a hash next to them on each card.  <br/><br/>The character with a want attached is central.  The scene should revolve around them.  The character opposite the scene\xe2\u20ac\u2122s want is peripheral but should be in the scene.  The player of the third character (the one who isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t central and isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t on the card with the scene\xe2\u20ac\u2122s want) gets to frame the scene.  Go play!<br/><br/><b>EXAMPLE</b><br/><br/>Me and three friends get together.  We whip up some cards and end up with:<br/><br/>Card one:  Dr. Perriera, the hospital cafeteria, love, and way out of her depth!<br/><br/>Card two:  Dr. Lattimore, the emergency room, Alice Perriera (as a want) and he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bleeding out!<br/><br/>Card three:  Powell (a medical student), Wagon Wheel Saloon, the exam key, and an old enemy comes calling!<br/><br/>Card four:  Mike Fisher, RN, Exam room one, compassion, and one chaste kiss!<br/><br/>Mike Fisher is my guy, so I put down the card with him on it.<br/><br/>Steve looks at the possibilities and adds Powell\xe2\u20ac\u2122s card, attaching \xe2\u20ac\u0153The exam key\xe2\u20ac\x9d to Fisher.  He authored Powell and wants to push his story.<br/><br/>Mike has to connect situation to location.  He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s got a bunch of choices, but really likes \xe2\u20ac\u0153an old enemy comes calling\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  In the cafeteria or in the emergency room?  Emergency room!  That element is on a Card with Joel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s character, Dr. Lattimore.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games//medical_hospital/images/mh_card_idea_3.jpg"/><br/><br/>The scene revolves around Mike Fisher.  Powell, played by Steve, will be in it for sure.  And the scene is framed by Joel, who plays mean old Dr. Lattimore.  ER Nurse Mike Fisher is going to deal with the key to an exam (presumably one of Powell\xe2\u20ac\u2122s), and an old enemy is going to show up, probably in the E.R.  Cool!

I missed what you were intending with the "L". (whooshing sound as plane flies over Chris' head)<br/><br/>Let me try looking at this with a new eye.  Only picking it apart out of R.E.S.P.E.C.T.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Write down something the character wants along the right (short) edge of the index card you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been handed.</blockquote>\nIt's not clear from this sentence whether it's something that a (generic) character wants, or that the character on the same card wants.  Which were you intending?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Steve looks at the possibilities and adds Powell\xe2\u20ac\u2122s card, attaching \xe2\u20ac\u0153The exam key\xe2\u20ac\x9d to Fisher.  He authored Powell and wants to push his story.</blockquote>\nFor some reason, this seems potentially problematic to me.  Won't you always be able to push "your" character on the person to your right?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The player of the third character (the one who isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t central and isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t on the card with the scene\xe2\u20ac\u2122s want) gets to frame the scene.</blockquote>\nWas this added to support GM-less play?  Is this third character supposed to be in the scene?  Or are all scenes two players only?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Mike Fisher is my guy, so I put down the card with him on it.</blockquote>\nI presume you are going for character ownership here?  Have you considered distributing it to open things up more?  It seems like I am always going to lead with my card when it's my scene.  And if you are to my left, you are going to add on your card, which will cause the same motivation/character matchup to occur (as well as the same supporting character) each time I have a scene.  If you are sitting to my left, what is your player motivation to add a different card?<br/><br/>And along those same lines, if players have their own "character card", don't you end up limiting the amount of content (and thus combinations) in the game?  This would especially be true for a 3-4 person game.  If there were some "extras" and anyone could grab any character to play, it seems like the game might flow better in the long run.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81831/#Comment_81831" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T15:11:47+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  3:11PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Sands</cite>Jason, you're talking in terms of setting up a single session here, but it strikes me that keeping all your old cards would be fantastic for revisiting favorite bits and pieces of previous sessions too.</blockquote>\nMike, your comment reminded me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Blank_White_Cards" rel="nofollow">"1000 Blank White Cards"</a> card game.

His is sleep.  Lattimore's hot for Perriera?  His is "Perriera's underpants".  Perriera wants Lattimore's job?  Hers is "Lattimore's job".  And so on.  <br/><br/>You've got three cards that define a scene:<br/><br/>A is who the scene focuses on, and it is the first card laid down (Fisher in the example).<br/>B is A's interestfor the scene (Powell's card in the example)<br/>C is situation and location (Lattimore's card in the example)<br/><br/>The guys on cards A and B haveto be in the scene.  Anybody else can be in the scene, but A is the star and B must be, because the scene is about <i>the thing he wants but cannot have.  </i><br/><br/>The next scene will focus on the guy on either B or C, which becomes the new A.  It's like a camera drifting from actor to actor in an uninterrupted take.<br/><br/>EDIT:  One more thing - the "thing you cannot have, ever" ends up working really well as a point of interest, sometimes in weird ways.  How do you reconcile Mean old Dr. Lattimore and "sleep"?  Well, since Powell must be in the scene, there's the obvious rousting of the student, but other more subtle possibilities present themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81834/#Comment_81834" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T15:23:38+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  3:23PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2007 3:24PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Won't you always be able to push "your" character on the person to your right?</blockquote>\nI don't know about ownership.  Maybe it can be a lighter touch.  It's an open question and probably depends on the application.  If this gets used for Medical hospital i think I want people to invest heavily in "their guy".  <br/><br/>I think scene creation can be loose as long as you've got a couple of protagonist types, Chris.  \n<blockquote>And along those same lines, if players have their own "character card", don't you end up limiting the amount of content (and thus combinations) in the game?

I whipped up seven cards and it was a comfortably diverse set of elements.

My default with the Film Noir game was that the group would generate twice as many character cards as there were (non-GM) players, so there would always be plenty to choose from.  But I like your idea of altering the number of cards would change not only the length of the game (if you are using hash marks), but potentially also the dynamics by making it a "tighter" or "looser" game thematically.  <br/><br/>IOW, a group can choose to have a tight game involving a small amount of important elements.  Or more of an ensemble cast with a disparate group of elements to choose from.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>First of all, the thing opposite the character's name?<i>It's the thing they cannot have, ever.</i></blockquote>\nYeah, that is great.  But game dynamics-wise, I find it funny that if B puts his card to the left of A, then A's scene will always be about B's interest.  And B will be in the scene as a secondary character.  <br/><br/>Is it your intent that if B is in A's scene, that the scene is always about the thing that B cannot have?  That's a cool trope the first time it happens (for each A-B, A-C, A-D, etc. combo), but I wish there was a way to switch things up more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81841/#Comment_81841" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T15:51:22+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  3:51PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm thinking that the "want" category is a creative spur that can be parsed differently, but yeah, it does seem weird.

The premise is telling the story of a battle that has already happened and you are able to "maneuver" your elements with these cards.  <br/><br/>Because the cards are so flexible, I came up with a couple of different formats for the cards themselves as well as a number of "battlefield" layouts that could be used.  The game is currently stalled, but I maybe this will spark some ideas for you and some enthusiasm for me.<br/><br/>Quick note on Suits:  Clubs - Offensive, Diamonds - Defense, Spades - Maneuvers, Hearts - Support<br/><br/>Here are sample cards:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.fusionofthought.com/rpg/WSCardTypes.jpg"/><br/><br/>Here are some sample layouts using those cards.  When symbols (or in the case above, elements) are touching, they are in conflict.  These formats would allow a single element to bridge multiple cards to create a more complicated structure.  Turning the cards then also produces some interesting results.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.fusionofthought.com/rpg/WSCardLayout1.jpg"/> or <img alt="image" src="http://www.fusionofthought.com/rpg/WSCardLayout4.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I'm not as worried anymore. And seeing group creation projects in this sort of "Stone Soup" vein, along with the collaborative fun stuff like the Names Project and other activities big and small, well, ...I'd rather risk opening the floodgates and the possibility of 1, 2 and 3 occuring, if it means that group creations like this will go down.<br/><br/>So it's not super-official yet, but consider the ban on "Design at Story Games" lifted. The more universal/collaborative the creation, the more props the project will get.<br/><br/>So, if folks are cool with it, and there's still some juice left in this stone to squeeze, then keep squeezing!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82151/#Comment_82151" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T20:38:57+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  8:38PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Sweet.

More matches, either heads or tails, is better.  This is the universal rule.  <br/><br/>Tails indicate negative outcomes, evil, and disaster.  Heads indicate positive outcomes, goodness, and triumph.  This factors into narration color, mostly.  You can win a conflict using tails, but the outcome must be negative overall.  You can lose a conflict using heads, but the outcome must be positive overall.  <br/><br/>A card is \xe2\u20ac\u0153owned\xe2\u20ac\x9d by the player of the character written on the card.<br/><br/>1.  Set up the three cards as discussed.  Players bid coins for positioning; high bidder chooses who will lay cards and in what order, or can elect to choose a tactile surgical procedure instead.  (If a procedure is chosen, stop reading this checklist) <br/><br/>2.  Place one coin on each card, plus one for each hash mark.  Hash marks indicate card elements were used in previous scenes.  <br/><br/>3.  The owner of the Character card plays their protagonist in the spotlight for the scene.  This player takes all the coins on the Character card.<br/><br/>4.  The owner of the Location/Event card \xe2\u20ac\u201c the one that has neither Character or Issue \xe2\u20ac\u201c frames a scene that includes Location and a secondary character.  This player doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get any coins!  The Location/Event card coins go into a general pool.  <br/><br/>5.  The owner of the Issue card is responsible for explicitly tying the Event and Issue into the scene.  This player takes all the coins on the Issue card.  <br/><br/>6.  You now have a scene framed.  There is a protagonist, a secondary character (who may be an antagonist), a Location and an Event all pointed at an Issue.  Play the scene out.<br/><br/>7.  Is there a conflict?  Resolve it.  The player of the protagonist puts forward coins from their own pile, up to the number originally on the Character card.  Other players can contribute coins for adversity from their own piles, or from the general pool.  Both sides flip their coins and look for matches.  The side with the most matches wins and narrates the outcome.  Ties go to the protagonist.  Used coins are discarded.  <br/><br/>8.  Is there a chance for transformation?  One player may spend and flip coins to attempt to change a card element.  Protagonist, Issue, and finally Event/Location player may elect to do this, in that order.  <br/><br/>Three matches = re-write the Location on any card in the scene.<br/>Four matches = re-write the Event on any card in the scene.<br/>Five matches = re-write the Issue on any card in the scene.<br/>Six or more matches = re-write the Character on any card in the scene.  <br/><br/>Depending on how the coins fall, you may have two choices.<br/><br/>9.  Add hash marks to the four elements used in the scene.  The cards used will gradually become more potent as they are reincorporated.  Repeat!<br/><br/>* * * <br/>This is rough, so I'd welcome comments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
