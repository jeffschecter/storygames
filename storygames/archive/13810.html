Scott, the host of the podcast, ported that term over to story games. Ludic peripety is characteristic of a game where the mechanics produce a dramatic-but-logical surprise or dramatic turn of events.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI find this a very powerful idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe participants mention Burning Empires as an example where conflict mechanics, like Fire Fight!, or Duel of Wits produce pretty dramatic changes.  I would include the conflict mechanics of Sorcerer as well.  The hosts use this term in a discussion of Story Games, but I find Ludic Peripety a really enjoyable property of D&amp;D (old school and 4th ed as well).  That fumble or crit that makes your 1st level schmoe look like a bad ass or which sends him to the grave -- those are the source of a lot of fun tension, whereas more forgiving versions of D&amp;D soften the blows or limit the meaningful risks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome games seem to lack this.  The relative unkillability of characters in Spirit of the Century, and the accumulation of Fate Points, protect characters against deadly surprises and help them build up to the final conflict with the big bad.  But it is a foregone conclusion that the Big Bad will buy it.  Hero Quest, with its dramatic rhythms, all but rules out surprising reversals.  Interesting branch points in the story, yes, but in-your-face reversal of fortune, no.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love those last two games but I find myself jonesing to introduce peripety and am tempted to throw out provocative GM fiat or over-the-top off-the-top-of-my-head mayhem just to juice up the interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan surprising reversals be introduced into systems where it wasn't intended, or does it depend on clever management of the fiction only?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone even run across this concept before?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
