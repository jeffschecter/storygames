I didn't, but I really dig the idea, so let's discuss how it would be done! Here are my initial thoughts---feel free to agree, disagree, and suggest your own:<br/><br/><b>1) [Principle] Never point a NPC at your own character, always point them at another player's ronin.</b><br/>So at times players will have to be simultaneously playing ronin and NPCs, right? This is just a reminder that you shouldn't be trying to "GM" and antagonize your own ronin.<br/><br/>-- <i>1b) Scenes that include all the ronin must contain at least two antagonistic forces.</i><br/>This is just a logical extension of the basic principle, but it impacts the following rules.<br/><br/><b>2) [Principle] Your ronin is a tool for antagonizing the other players' character.</b><br/>When you're looking at antagonizing another's character, this is a reminder that you should consider using your own ronin as much as using a NPC.<br/><br/><b>3) [Rule] In a given scene, players may only control one NPC besides their own ronin.</b><br/>What this means is if players want a scene with multiple NPCs, multiple players will need to step up and act in "GM" mode. Note, mobs of mooks and inanimate forces/obstacles act as a single, unified NPC (per normal rules).<br/><br/><b>4) [Rule] Each scene, the role of "Scene Guide" rotates around the table. The Scene Guide is responsible for scene framing and controlling an NPC (if the scene is to include any)</b><br/><br/>-- <i>4b) If the scene is to include multiple NPCs, then the Scene Guide should ask who wants to control which NPC.</i><br/><br/>-- <i>4c) During scene framing---or anytime, really--any player may jump in with an additional NPC, given the Scene Guide's consent.</i><br/>Anyone may make suggestions for a scene and volunteer to add in an NPC, but the buck stops with the Scene Guide.<br/><br/><b>5) [Rule] Per normal player rules, players may only add contextual information (backstory, etc) that relates to their ronin's dark fate.</b><br/>In other words, during normal narration, players should constrain themselves to the situation "on the mountain". Anything "off the mountain" must stem from the ronin's dark fate.<br/>________________________<br/><br/>Is that it? Is that all we need besides all the normal GM stuff?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394190/#Comment_394190" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T12:40:13+00:00" title="October 21, 2012 12:40PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2012 12:41PM by J_Walton.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That kind of "troupe" approach would definitely work. Honestly, there are a number of different viable approaches I could think of but, honestly, you should probably only put one in the book if you're comfortable with it, have used it in play at least a few times, and are confident that you're able to describe how it works.<br/><br/>Other possible options:<br/><br/>1) Pick a rotating player to portray "The Witch" (including his/her forces and all manner of badness on the mountain) for each challenge that the players come across. That player's ronin only plays a supporting role in this conflict or, at the end of the conflict, you narrate them missing out on the action due to dealing with some aspect of their Dark Fate (which allows players grist for deciding if they trust them more or less).<br/><br/>2) Before play begins the players create a stack of challenge cards, something like the monster cards in Castle Ravenloft, but these also have things like the icy mirror in which each ronin sees the thing they most dread. A set of pre-generated example cards could also be provided, with classic Mountain Witch challenges. The cards should also have directions for playing out the challenges, like "when it's your turn to fight the wolves, the player on your left describes what the wolves do: picking one of the following options..." The final card describes the Witch and how that fight works. During play, when the ronin press further up the mountain or stop for the night, draw one card and play out the challenge that they encounter.<br/><br/>3) Have each player generate challenges based on their Dark Fate somehow?<br/><br/>There's probably a lot more possible options too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394201/#Comment_394201" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T15:20:35+00:00" title="October 21, 2012  3:20PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm inclined to suggest Panty Explosion's approach here:<br/>You need a Rival, (more or less the ronin you trust least) to narrate nasty stuff in, and point stuff at your ronin.<br/><br/>No need to mess with the "naration" rules.

What absolutely <i>must</i> change if the GM role's duties are distributed? My gut feeling is not much.<br/><br/>In line with what JWalt says above, remember that all that GM stuff does not necessarily need to be parceled out evenly. You can play without a GM and still make one guy in charge of the Witch for example - see Archipelago for an example of a game that asks you to choose what's important (with TMW you may just go ahead and do this as the designer) and then assign responsibility for those things to individuals.

There are times when I've run it that the players turn their Dark Fates at one another so hard that I just became a "yes and" and "yes but" guy.  If they had stolen failure narration, the GM role would have been completely superfluous in those games.<br/><br/>(It only lasted a scene or two, but it's worth mentioning.  The game itself already has the ability to glide smooth without GM interference.)<br/><br/><i>You don't really have to change anything if players are inclined to work NPC actions into their own successful narrations.</i><br/><br/>Re: Jason.  Yes.  For groups that want a formal ownership, have one player take "control" of the Witch, make decisions based on the Witch's interests.  Maybe have another player take "control" of The Angry Mountain itself, or Yukki-Onna, or the Emperor's Elite Assassins (who are trying to get there first.)<br/><br/>Decide on the number of external threats that seems appropriate before-hand.  No need to have a one player : one threat/faction relationship.<br/><br/>Perhaps rotate them based on total Trust.  The ronin with the least total Trust at the table?  You get X.  The ronin with the most Trust at the table?  You get Y.  This would naturally change every Chapter.<br/>Because I loved creating and playing a character in How We Came To Live Here, just to hand it off to the other GM in the next scene and see what became of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
