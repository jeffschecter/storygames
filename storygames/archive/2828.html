Lot carries its destruction, and he'll probably die along with it.  The survival of both Gamorrah and Lot depend on his finding or creating a thriving goodness in that world.  He turns his attention to the teaching a group of the most childlike beings he could find.  They're probably creations of a witch or something.  Things get episodic.  He reaches for lessons (charms?) they may grasp; they have adventures in which each lesson is proven valuable or worthless to them.  Time is limited (maybe the world is about to achieve space-travel or something).  Moreover, teaching his pupils to be nice is a good way to for them to get killed, the world being what it is.  If he fails to change the world in a meaningful way, which of his own lessons will he break to get himself out alive (or will he try to save his flawed pupils instead)?<br/><br/>I dunno.  Which rpg already out would be best for exploring this sort of idea?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64208/#Comment_64208" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T16:17:43+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  4:17PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about what game that is currently out there, but this gives me all sorts of scenario ideas for <a href="http://www.modus-operandi.co.uk/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_details&amp;gid=71&amp;Itemid=26" rel="nofollow">my 24 hour espionage game</a> in which you play fallen angels.  Are you trying to find good people in Gomorrah, to stop the oncoming rain of fire?  Or are you bringing it on to punish the sinners?  Or are you enticing the sinners to sin, because you're really working for Hell?  Or, as an agent of Hell, are you trying to hide the sins of the Gomorrans, so that they won't be slaughtered (and can keep sinning)?  Lots of angelic intrigue potential around that story.<br/><br/><br/>Which, uh, maybe isn't that useful to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64228/#Comment_64228" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T20:28:10+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  8:28PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you play Lot or the Children?
