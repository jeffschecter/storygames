(Which really isn't saying much, but still).  Play was structured, focused and easy, and while we didn't inject as much depth as we could have, the fact that things kept <i>happening</i> made it great.  Also everyone liked the "Angry" condition and really ran with it.  We crammed a whole session's worth of awesome into a couple of hours and the players were like "What?  It's only 8:00?  It felt like we did a lot more!"  I worry that the upcoming GURPS game is going to feel sluggish by comparison.  So, yeah.  Mouse Guard isn't exactly underrated, but it's what I've got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204470/#Comment_204470" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T11:03:21+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 11:03AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2009 11:21AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm usually pretty vocal about what is rocking in my house.  Here's something that is pre-rocking in my house, since it has not yet been released - I hope that is not Snyder heresy.<br/><br/>Brennan Taylor's How We Came To Live Here is a fantasy game inspired by the Anasazi and other native peoples of the American southwest.  Things I utterly adore about HWCTLH:<br/><br/>1.  Gender roles matter.  They matter in a huge, huge, game-changing way, and a group of male characters is going to be at a significant disadvantage in addressing problems.  Or they will address them in big, obvious, limited ways.  The reverse is also true of course.  This is unspeakably cool in play.<br/><br/>2.  The fantasy is very fresh and respectfully inspired by a lifeway about a million miles removed from European thugs with swords.  The monsters are genuinely weird and terrifying and often can be dealt with through methods other than violence.  Like marriage.  The culture is riddled with kiva societies, some secret and some public, and being a member has genuine consequence.  <br/><br/>3.  Community is central and the game brilliantly directs problems either outward or inward, which maps to masculine and feminine as well.  <br/><br/>A super cool game stuffed with coolness.  I can't wait until it is released.  Soon, I hope.<br/><br/>EDIT to comply with Snyder's Third Law:  I playtested the game and reviewed the manuscript, offering feedback, and I am an unapologetic shill in forums like this.  Once I get my hands on it I will play it some more and write about my experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204475/#Comment_204475" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T11:15:46+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 11:15AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2009 11:16AM by Matt Snyder.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OH!

It's very underappreciated, too; I think it's because the game's written in a somewhat round-about way and doesn't necessarily always spell out the cool implications about the setting as clearly as it should. I'm completely enthralled by the fact that what is arete is determined by the primarch of a given world, for instance. It really hits home the idea that the experience system is not solely about whether your character is a magician or warrior; those matters are ultimately local, the real issue is whether you're willing to play by the primarch's rules or not.<br/><br/>What I would like to do with Nine Worlds would be to rewrite the text to express to others how and why I think it's a really exciting setting and system. I'm much too busy to do this for real in the near future, but I might contact Matt about it at some future time to find out what he'd think of a new edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204499/#Comment_204499" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T12:05:21+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 12:05PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://ipressgames.com/" rel="nofollow">With Great Power</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm Superman.

Sometimes it gets to the point where players have a hand of wildcards. Tracking hands of cards between games can be a small pain. I'd love to see optional rules for shorter fights towards the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've run the game at many local events. I have serious blocks writing actual play. But I'm going to get back into illustration in the coming year and when I have time I would do a drawing to be used in promotional materials for free.

It lets people compete and create a story. Really. You don't really have winners in it, because it is possible for you to gain the resource you want and the other player to get what they want, and even if you didn't get the resource you desired, you get another resource!<br><br>And those resources, these currency-chits? You use them to control the flow of the story.<br><br>What it needs? It could probably use a re-write, though I've myself encountered one of its stumbling blocks: It's a really procedural game, so you really can't get a grasp of it from reading the text, but I'm not sure if a non-procedural approach would work better. It could also use some revamped layout (I also think the colour is incidental, originally I didn't get it because of the colour, and when finding out how incidental it is, the game jumped into my hands).<br><br>I sort of help(ed?) by discussing it with friends, sometimes mentioning it in my posts (if it seems I bash it, I only use it as an example to discuss what I want to do different, because that's the <i>best example I have</i>.

I love this game.  It's such a hard sell.  Romantic Breakup?  Wererats?  WTF?!  I'm not sure what it says about me that as soon as Ron said, "It's a game about romantic breakups and they might be wererats" I instantly "got it" without having to read a single rule.<br><br>Some cool shit that happened in my awesome play of it:<br><br>In each of the three chapters there was a background character who appeared somewhere in the chapter.  In the first chapter he was a poet in a coffee shop spinning his rat poetry.  In the second chapter he had a art exhibition of rat portraits in a major gallery.  By the third chapter he had achieve national pop-culture recognition as "Ratmania!" swept the nation.<br><br>In the second chapter, the man in the relationship, Daniel (who went full Wererat), turned his sick mother over one of his wererat brood to care for her so that he could stay with Viola.  We narrated a shot of his mother sitting in a wheel chair as a wererat shadow loomed over her a door closes her in.  In third chapter, as scene was set at her funeral.  There was this nice palpable unanswered "?" hanging over the whole scene.<br><br>Viola, the woman in the relationship, getting a new boyfriend who was more less exactly LIKE Daniel and him beginning to show wererat signs himself.  This was because despite Daniel's "monstrous-ness" almost everyone felt sorry for him because it seemed like his behavior was largely defensive against Viola's neediness.  So here she was doing it AGAIN!<br><br>Danial rolling his "Murderous" stat at a poetry slam to "rip Viola apart" with scathing poetry."<br><br>Us having to have Daniel killed because there was NO WAY OUT for these two.  Hell, in the last few scenes they kept being inappropriately intimate.  It looked like they were going to get back together again.<br><br>It was horrible.  It was surreal.  It was awesome.  It Was A Mutual Decision.<br><br>I've TRIED running it at conventions but as I say it's a hard sell.  It also has a vulnerability in that if ALL you care about is the wererat lever you can pull it doesn't really work right.  The game doesn't "break" per se but the fiction produced isn't all that compelling.  You have to love the characters first, and season appropriately with the wererat.<br><br/>I've thought about kicking up the stakes a notch and reworking some sections of it to create a variant called 'Till Death.  The idea is to escalate the situation from simple "break up" to full on Divorce.  And the Wererat element turns into Ghost.  So you see, we have a married couple torn apart and that might be because one or more of them is DEAD.

But hear me out. Normally I'm into RPGs that are deep, emotional, often tragic experiences. <i>Annalise</i> and <i>Polaris</i> are great examples of the sorts of games that I usually like to play.<br/><br/>Blood Red Sands is not any of these things. Instead, it is a testosterone-fueled, uber-macho, over-the-top, in-your-face, heavy metal fantasy competitive RPG epic experience. (Did I pile on enough adjectives there?)<br/><br/>Let's put it this way. Have you heard of Conan? You know, Conan the Barbarian?<br/><br/>Weakling. He wouldn't survive for a day in the world of Blood Red Sands.<br/><br/>Most of our play has been the stop-and-go of playtesting. I'm looking forward to the day that we can simply sit down and <i>play</i>.<br/><br/>If I understand correctly, a playtest version of this game should be available soon. When the announcement is made, all of you should rise up and claim your copy.<br/><br/>Unless you're simply not metal enough....<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204516/#Comment_204516" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T12:54:26+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 12:54PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

It rocks because it scales in intensity based on what you put in to it -- play it soft, and it covers you like a warm blanket of relationships and emerging symbolism...play it hard, and it lets you slaughter whole nations and burn forever in the sun. It rocks because the conflict mechanics produce interesting results whether you win or lose, and are just plain fun to engage in on their own. It rocks because.....fucking Eskimo-punk, man!<br/><br/>It could be improved by either raising attribute scores so that swings in conflicts are less significant, or at least limit how many traits can be used to alter the dice rolls, for the same reason. Also, Bill could run more sessions of it at conventions, or at least create a step-by-step guide to running a game so that it would be less intimidating for someone else (like me) to run it at conventions.

I have these lapses when I find that every rpg in the world sucks - but not PE. I'm not sure I know why... but the only downside I've fond with the game so far is that it can kind of suck to be the GM since you're excluded from narrating in big part... but then again, it's awesome that it puts so much into the hands of the players, both individually and as a group. And seriously: it's a game where you're supposed to be mean to each other... and beat up demons... and steal each others boyfriends... that's just so totally awesome!<br/><br/>I'd like to think that I've already been part of spreading the game a little by bringing it to Sweden's biggest game convention and running it (if only a few times). I directed people to where they could buy it and supplied them with the price right off the bat so they knew exactly how things were. I'll definitely be taking it to more conventions (especially now with the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9190" rel="nofollow">name signs I put together</a> to speed things up!).<br/><br/>I'd be totally down with critiquing the second edition text and supplying my opinions on anything. Putting together a playset or maybe a document with a bunch of scenario seeds should be very doable.<br/><br/>If I was more confident in my layout skills I'd offer my services in that department as well.

Even if you don't like boxing (like me) or you just don't know about it, it just isn't about that. If it really bothers you, change the sport and setting to Roman gladiators or professional wrestling or anything else where desperate down-and-outs bring the pain against each other for an uncaring crowd. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrestler_(2008_film)" rel="nofollow">The Wrestler</a> is one PC's story in a Contenders' game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's about guys in the gutter trying to pull themselves up and make ends meet and keep their promises and make a better life for themselves and <i>for someone else</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you know, it's about failing all of that. Betraying the one person you have left because of some stupid grudge match or because you're in too deep with the mafia or drugs or whatever it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) It's GMless, so everyone's in it struggling against each other, and I like that it's kinda competitive in that most games will only have one success story, but the tragic stories are done so well too that you can really relish the downward spiral. Because you know, the more messed up you get, the more messed up stuff you do. So what if your family left you and you had to retire from boxing? You're now rolling in dough as muscle for some drug baron. And that punk who beat you in the ring? Break his legs and supply drugs to his sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's plays like a competitive <i>My Life with Master</i>, but tone and theme-wise more like the street side of <i>the Wire</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The website looks kinda awful to me, and the stuff related to each game is split on two pages (the Product page and the Resources page). But mostly, Joe Prince needs to just run it and AP it more, I think... And I should probably AP it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that it's a sport RPG is a big turn-off for lots of folks, but not much you can do about that. I hear that a fantasy spin-off version is in the works, but, I'm not sure that will pull in any more people, and it misses out on that down and dirty tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a revised edition wouldn't go amiss, and it should drum up some more interest. The art in the print version is a little small and dark. There's some advice on running the game that's missing (like, how to keep bouts interesting to narrate), and some minor rules niggles (mechanically, threatening a connection costs too much and gains too little for what is a powerful scene in the fiction, and sometimes bouts just go on for too damn long).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it's worth, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.box.net/shared/ox9bskeppi" rel="nofollow">here's my custom double-sided charsheets and NPC sheet</a> with slightly modified rules on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204654/#Comment_204654" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T06:59:32+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  6:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Richard,</p>\n<p>Your post has been the first mention of Contenders to really make me sit up and pay attention.

Nine Worlds is my usual "but... it's just so <i>awesome</i>!" rave. So... hmmm.... let's see... oh!<br><br><b>The Dictionary of Mu</b><br/><br/>The fucking Dictionary, people! You want to talk about "oracles games" or quick-play modules that give you a starting point for you to fill in the blanks and inspire people to go to the table and play... Mu is the perfect archetype for this kind of thing. It's a book filled to the brim with amazing ideas, each one beautifully written, and each one containing one barely sketched, unfinished corner that you just can't ignore. "But what about <i>this</i>? I must know more!" It gets into your brain and you just can't stand it. You have to go play Sorcerer (on friggin' MARS) to scratch that itch. And that's a wonderful thing.<br/><br/>How to help support the game: Fix the broken links on the Mu homepage. Especially the links to the fantastic quick-play Mu character sheets Judd made.

You draw cards and count successes. Say you chose 3 consequences and scored 2 successes. The other players name your consequences (your husband finds out what you do at night...). You then decide how to spend your successes, a success can either gain a goal or remove a consequence. So with 2 successes you can gain your goal, remove 1 consequence, and take 2 consequences. Or screw your goal and only take 1 consequence.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach scene you may name an element that becomes recurring.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your turn, you can choose to GM for someone or have someone GM for you. As a GM, the more the player invest resources in the scene, the more you earn for later when you are the protagonist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205032/#Comment_205032" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T10:49:17+00:00" title="May  3, 2009 10:49AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played it, and I'm still in my first read-through, but I'm really impressed by Agon so far. <br><br>The theme turned me off before, which is weird because otherwise I really dig epic Greekiness.

The rules are disgustingly simple, but they could easily abscond the (paraphrased) tagline from the game Othello, "easy to learn, a lifetime to master."<br/><br/>In order to help promote it, I gave away my (now out of print) copy to my friend in Puerto Rico and ran his group through a game.
