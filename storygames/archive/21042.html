Not posted here in literal years, but just wondering if anyone could advise with a couple brief questions about Night Witches?<br/><br/>1) The handout "Twenty-four hours with the 588th" gives the option to "SUPPORT another airwoman or REACH OUT to her" however there is no SUPPORT Move listed in the book as far as I can tell. Is this a missing bit? I'd assume it amounts to the similar roll+Hx in AW to give a player +1 forward, but I'm up to being wrong.<br/><br/>2) The handout for the one-shot "Pashkovskaya Nocturne" says "Ask them to advance their characters four times" and the book says to do this "[by] choosing six Advances" (p74) - so which is correct? Also, I assume that by Advances, they mean full advances rather than just ticks in advancement boxes?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461701/#Comment_461701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T15:37:59+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  3:37PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, thanks for your questions! When it doubt, trust the book over the handouts. We've posted some errata changes for the second printing here: <br/><br/><a href="http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/night-witches/night-witches-errata/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/night-witches/night-witches-errata/</a><br/><br/>1) Support was part of a previous version of the rules, and was removed. We need to update that handout. The best way to support fellow players is to Reach Out and to try to earn Mission Pool for the night time missions. If you want your character to help them during scenes on the ground, you could also narrate yourself into the scene and use other moves (Act Up, Eyeball, etc) to try to shape things in their favor. <br/><br/>2) For the one-shot, the line about four times should be amended to six, to match the book. These are full advances, with all that that entails. The idea is that you've completed training at Engels and are seasoned pilots with history, relationships, newly-won promotions and ranks, etc. If you have the supplemental card deck, I highly recommend using that for this process, as it adds a nice visual to the table and makes this advancement process even more fun. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461707/#Comment_461707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T16:58:54+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  4:58PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks so much for your help, Steve!<br/><br/>Can the players Reach Out during the mission, as the handout implies, or is it purely something for Day, as the Moves sheet indicates?<br/><br/>Ooh, hadn't seen the cards - will have to order some next time I'm in the States!<br/><br/>One other brief question - in our session the players managed to essentially ace the Wayfind and Bombing Run rolls, which made the evening mission seem fairly easy - should I have thrown in some added complications, or was it correct to let them have their easy victory this time?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461729/#Comment_461729" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T20:10:08+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  8:10PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reaching Out during a mission is nearly impossible but if the fiction supports it, I guess it could happen over the clatter and oil spatter of a Shvetsov M-11 engine. But usually, no.<br/><br/>Acing those rolls is what the players ought to be trying really hard to do. Missions are so lethal that you shouldn't add anything unless, again, the fiction demands it. It's OK if missions go perfectly. Don't forget that they need to manage their days - if they are running around and not sleeping, there is a cost.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461744/#Comment_461744" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-06T00:15:58+00:00" title="April  6, 2017 12:15AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jason!<br/><br/>It was my first attempt at GMing the game, and the group universally loved it, so I must have done <i>something</i> right!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461755/#Comment_461755" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-06T14:02:02+00:00" title="April  6, 2017  2:02PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look at your principles and keep your options open - I often have some additional threat lurking in the wings during missions in case of the need for crazy hard moves coming up. A really good one is a dedicated Po-2 hunter in a distinctively marked plane (ask my first playtest group about "yellow tail"). Anything you can darkly warn about in an intelligence briefing is good for this. Maybe you'll never need it! Just the intimation will keep them nervous.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461756/#Comment_461756" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-06T14:03:12+00:00" title="April  6, 2017  2:03PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2017 2:03PM by Aviatrix.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've actually long pondered just how much the fiction will push the mechanics on some of those missions--like, if the description mentions specifically fighter cover or heavy AA, how much effect (if any) that puts on the actual mission resolution. I generally don't make it have any mechanical effect, but do include as much scene setting as possible and try and map the consequences on to it.<br/><br/>In passing I will note that it is possible to create very survivable mission crews: in our extended (entire war!) run of Night Witches, one PC pushed her luck to +3 and then took the move that lets you map Luck onto another move--in this case, Wayfinding. So she always found the target, and generally was able to avoid enemy fire. (My PCs secret to surviving the whole war was to get in command, stay in command, and always assign herself pilot duty on that Navigator's plane!)<br/><br/>I've probably been a little too gentle on pilots and crashes, often letting people get at least a Tempt Fate to survive. This points out that it's important to make clear to players that NW is a game where sometimes you'll die just <i>because</i>, unlike say Monsterhearts or Apocalypse World, where there's usually a much longer chain of events that got you there.<br/><br/>OTOH, I could be cruel when I needed to. One time the players took the "Another Plane goes down" consequence, in the (false) assurance that of course I would select the NPC plane. Since I was not required to do that, and since a consequence with no consequences isn't a consequence, the first plane dodged the Focke-Wulf that was trying to shoot them down--and then its wing clipped the tail of the other PC-only plane, putting it into an unrecoverable dive. I was modestly proud of that scene-setting, the result of watching far too many episodes of plane crash disaster shows. :-)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
