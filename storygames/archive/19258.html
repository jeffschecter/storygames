I can't guarantee to speed up work on any of them unless interest is very high, but it'll give me an idea of the direction I need to be travelling in over the next 1-2 years or so. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We The Jury</span>, about a group of jurors unable to reach a verdict, with various of them having their own agendas. It'll be not so much like the Henry Fonda original, but the more recent film on the same theme.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A is for Anarchist</span>, about a group of anarchists/terrorists holed up in their hideout in the woods/mountains/an East London squat, with tensions mounting and tempers fraying, and the Police/Feds closing in. There'd be a spy, an emotionless intellectual, a fanatic, a guy who joined the group just for kicks, a spoilt rich girl etc.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disgraceful</span> is a game set in the 1920s which explores the conflict between ambition and morality at a time when seemingly anything was acceptable (\u2018Anything Goes\u2019, to quote the song title). Players have to negotiate the moral maze of 1920s Hollywood, and succeed in their ambitions without falling prey to the many temptations the city has to offer.

It\u2019s a high stakes game where the loser loses everything, and the winner doesn\u2019t lose <i>quite</i> so much.

Except that behind the picket fences the reps' lives are slowly imploding, with marriages under strain or on the rocks, reps sleeping with each other's wives and/or stealing each other's customers, their wives on amphetamines, their teenage daughters getting pregnant and having abortions, and their sons modelling themselves on James Dean, loafing around in leather jackets and crashing their Dads' cars in illegal drag races. <br/><br/>Influences:  <br/><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094155" rel="nofollow">Tin Men</a> <br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" rel="nofollow">Mad Men</a> and <br/><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048545" rel="nofollow">Rebel Without a Cause</a>.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No name 1</span>, a game about a secret Government unit set up to exploit trans-dimensional travel (vaguely similar to  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112167" rel="nofollow">Sliders</a>), and catch the villains who use it for their own nefarious purposes. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No name 2</span>, a black powder game about a land riven by civil war between powerful clans.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No name 3</span>, a game set about 50 years after the galaxy has been taken over by orcs, there being secret resistance cells on Terra and other planets that plot to shake off the orc yoke.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Leo                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428944/#Comment_428944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-28T16:40:22+00:00" title="February 28, 2014  4:40PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not what you're asking, but make the one that interests YOU.

Most seem like they're entirely valid concepts to investigate, but I'm not seeing any hooks that would immediately grab me. I would also be extremely hesitant of "voting" on the basis of genre familiarity or fandom leanings - not only because I don't have many leanings in that regard at this age, but also because it's a really bad heuristic for you to choose your next project based on whether I happen to be a fan of a given literary genre.<br/><br/>Maybe you should write up proper pitches, or even design documents, for the ones you actually believe in yourself the most? Chances are that most people, myself included, will get what excites you about a given concept if you write about them in more detail. It is also likely that you'll clarify for yourself which of the projects is most worthwhile if you write about them a bit - basic concepts, rough outline of content, market strategy, artistic and economic goals, schedule, resources, and so on.<br/><br/>(I already know what I'm going to do when I'm next in your position of having the luxury of choosing my next project: I'll be writing a "brainstorming bible" of all of the prospective projects for our studio, sort of like you've done here, except that mine will be about 5-10 pages about each project, examining their strengths and weaknesses. It'll be a bit of an effort, but once I have that on hand not only have I documented my inspirations in a snapshot useful years later, but I also have something that I can give to others to look at when I want this sort of consultation about whether my projects make any sense. Much easier to evaluate that from a proper project pitch than a one-line elevator pitch.)<br/><br/>For context, consider how a "design document" precedes game design in video game development; I've found that this is also useful in roleplaying, despite so much of the design and development work being easily unified.<br/><br/>In addition to the concept of "design document", consider the "sales pitch", which can also be illuminating, and is much less work. For an excellent and timely example, I find that Ron hit it out of the park with <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=288.0" rel="nofollow">his pitch page for <i>Circle of Hands</i></a> recently - that's the sort of explanation that immediately sells me on a game. Basically, if I can see why I would like to design a game myself from the pitch, then chances are that it's a worthwhile project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428984/#Comment_428984" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-01T14:44:20+00:00" title="March  1, 2014  2:44PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2014 9:46AM by catty_big.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Not what you're asking, but make the one that interests YOU. The one you want to play.</blockquote>\nUnfortunately I tried that approach and it didn't work <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>. The games I want to write tend to fall on stony ground, witness the less than rapturous reception that greeted <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19241/dead-man-talking#Item_2" rel="nofollow">Dead Man Talking</a>, which I still think has potential, but folks aren't interested in it so that's that. I know I'm not going to become a millionaire from RPGs, but I want my games to be at least <i>vaguely</i> commercial, and if you have a business making any kind of product, if it doesn't make products its customers want, you don't have a business. So I figured, rather than continue to indulge myself by writing game after game that <i>I</i> want to play, I should do what I've done here and see what games my <i>customers</i> want to play. <br/><br/>I considered writing a post discussing the difficulties of determining precisely what kinds of games people want, given that 1) tastes are likely to change between polling and producing, and what was popular when you started writing a game may no longer be so by the time it's published, 2) people may not necessarily give the question a great deal of thought, and might mention some genre or theme on a whim when if they thought about it it's probably not what they'd want to play after all, and 3) you are likely to end up with conflicting results, where a third of respondents favour an emotionally-charged story game, another third prefer a quasi-historical mythic Europe game, and the remaining third would like to see a light hearted slapstick-style game, which is kind of what I got when I posed the question on <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/thread/1131085/what-do-you-want-from-me" rel="nofollow">RPGGeek</a>, although on <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=16989" rel="nofollow">UKRoleplayers</a> the results were much more conclusive.\n<blockquote>I would like A is for Anarchist or Disgraceful the most I think, from what I can see here.

I want to try to eliminate some of the ideas <i>before</i> I get to stage of writing up a lot of material about them, which I don\u2019t want to do if there\u2019s not much likelihood that folks will want to play them. In fact, my polling has turned up the fact that there\u2019s zero interest in We The Jury, so I'm not going to waste any more time on that. Of course, it may be the way I phrased it- perhaps if I went into it in slightly more detail I would get a more positive response, but it does come down to time being a precious and limited resource.\n<blockquote>mine will be about 5-10 pages about each project, examining their strengths and weaknesses</blockquote>\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find that helpful for your design studio, but personally I doubt I\u2019ll be able to persuade people after 5-10 pages (by which time, in the case of We The Jury, on current evidence they\u2019d probably have thrown themselves under a bus) who I couldn\u2019t persuade after a paragraph, which is after all the point of elevator pitches.<br/><br/>But all of this is really just my reaction to frustration at pitching game after game and not getting any interest, which I accept depends on many more factors than whether a particular game\u2019s EP grabs people, although I do genuinely want to try to find out what people want. Another point is that pitching games to the community is complicated by the fact that one reaches it by and large via the mediation of forums, and much as I appreciate all the conversations I have with folks on the forums, and am grateful for all the advice, suggestions and comments I receive thereon, the community is much wider than that. This was brought home to me today when I met someone at a games day who expressed interest in a game that I\u2019d pitched before a few times and had pretty much given up on. Heigh ho.<br/><br/>One very positive thing to have come out of this exercise so far is that there seems to be a groundswell of support over three forums for AifA, so I\u2019ll get to work on that as soon as I can.<br/><br/>Further comments gratefully recieved \u2013keep \u2018em coming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428988/#Comment_428988" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-01T15:59:08+00:00" title="March  1, 2014  3:59PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that <i>We The Jury</i> sounds like an excellent subject matter for a game (based on that single-sentence description upthread); depending on the treatment and productization it might well be a very, very interesting game! That's the weakness in polling, particularly without proper scientific procedure; you're relying on people more ignorant than yourself, who might not even bother to give the matter any thought. Besides, I have no clue if you'd make the exciting game that I see when I imagine what I might do with the topic; your approach to this topic might be a dud from my viewpoint, I can't know without seeing a full-length pitch <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(The game I'd create of that topic would either be something similar to <i>Zombie Cinema</i> - very small, tight, well-productized - or something like <i>In a Wicked Age</i> - expansively tackling its topic, enticing of the imagination, branching out to embrace the entire legal genre. Both of those have certainly achieved reasonable commercial and critical success, so I'd be quite optimistic about this one as well. Goes to show how differently we can see these sorts of matters.)<br/><br/>Considering your stated goal of creating something that actually interests people (a worthwhile goal, I think; I myself am frustrated about writing something that nobody cares about as well), have you considered writing and developing for a pre-existing game line or brand? If your own artistic passion is currently at a low ebb, and you'd basically just want to do some craftsmanship on a subject matter that the audience wants, then an existing brand seems like it could ensure attention and make the product development easier as well, as you could rely on others working on the brand to support you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428989/#Comment_428989" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-01T16:02:49+00:00" title="March  1, 2014  4:02PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your intent is to gauge commercial viability, I doubt that forum polls for interest are a good proxy for customer dollars.  I can tell you which of your ideas sounds most fun to me, but that does not equate to me giving you any money.  I think requests that involve effort are a better metric -- "playtest this" or "review this manuscript" or "help fund this" etc.  <i>Of course</i> your audience wants you to do the work first before they'll truly engage with you -- ideas are plentiful and free.  For any of the 9 ideas you listed, why should I assume you can and will pull it off better than I could?  I need proof!<br/><br/>That said, since polls are fun and easy, I will happily respond.  I just wanted to throw that caveat out there first.<br/><br/><b>Chaotic Evil</b> is the one idea here where I can guess what it might be like to play it.  Loss-heavy PvP/GMvP with inept demons sounds fun.  I am curious about the flavor of "demon" and the mechanics behind winning and losing.  If these were good, I would play it.<br/><br/>"Ambition vs morality as society begins to abandon traditional morals" sounds interesting, but the 1920s version of "anything goes" was probably <i>less</i> permissive than today's mainstream, so <b>Disgraceful</b> is a maybe, pending situation ingredients.<br/><br/><b>Great Minds</b> sounds like a hilarious scene.  If you could somehow create a game that creates a series of such scenes while keeping it fresh, that'd be great.  Good luck...<br/><br/><b>MotorMouth</b> sounds like a nice starting premise that needs something interesting to be done with it.  Without a unique goal, it sounds like a Fiasco playset.<br/><br/>Holing up with tempers fraying doesn't address what I find interesting about Anarchists vs Feds.  I already wrote a game that creates the <b>A is for Anarchist</b> dynamics, and no one ever showed any interest.  I think the situation is too specific and limited.  Same for <b>We the Jury</b>.  The only thing that'd grab me here would be novel takes on <i>how</i> these concepts are explored (probably in the form of innovative rules).<br/><br/><b>No name 1</b> reminds me of the <a href="http://www.aetherco.com/continuum/" rel="nofollow">Continuum</a> hunting the Narcissists, and <b>No name 3</b> reminds me of Season 3 of the recent Battlestar Galactica series.

I need proof!</blockquote>\nEero and David make similar points here, to whit from a one-line description of a game there can be no way of telling whether or not <i>I</i> would make a decent fist of that game.\n<blockquote>Chaotic Evil is the one idea here where I can guess what it might be like to play it. Loss-heavy PvP/GMvP with inept demons sounds fun. I am curious about the flavor of "demon" and the mechanics behind winning and losing. If these were good, I would play it.</blockquote>\nThis game received a lot of support on RPGGeek, so I will definitely work on that, probably starting with a design doc that tries to answer your questions. \n<blockquote>"Ambition vs morality as society begins to abandon traditional morals" sounds interesting, but the 1920s version of "anything goes" was probably less permissive than today's mainstream, so Disgraceful is a maybe, pending situation ingredients.</blockquote>\nI think there was a similar amount of recreational drug use, the difference between then and now being that (until comparatively recently) it was associated with lower social strata, people in council estates and the criminal underworld- although it\u2019s become more acceptable among the higher strata more recently- whereas in the 20s it was generally confined to the upper clases. But I'll make sure I do the research necessary to get all those details right come the time to sit down and write it. And I think the fact that it was less acceptable in those days adds bite to the game, in that there is more for the characters to lose if they succumb to temptation, compared with nowadays when you're more likely to get a slap on the wrist for possession and low level drug use.  \n<blockquote>Great Minds sounds like a hilarious scene. If you could somehow create a game that creates a series of such scenes while keeping it fresh, that'd be great. Good luck... </blockquote>\nI imagine the game will consist of a series of tasks, much like InSpectres, with a points total at the end showing how effectively they've negotiated Real Life, but in terms of theme my intention is to examine prioritising and what's important. Let's say Enrico Fermi goes out to buy eggs, but he forgets to buy the eggs because he's distracted by something to do with transuranic elements, the discovering of which will ultimately win him a Nobel Prize. Ok, he forgot to buy eggs, but no-one ever got a Nobel Prize for remembering to buy eggs. However, at the time, the buying of eggs or otherwise is a gazillion times more important than discovering californium. After all, you can't make an omelette with californium. <br/><br/>I imagine most players will enjoy the opportunity to play absent-minded professors, but if they are of a scientific bent they can introduce actual science into the game.\n<blockquote><b>MotorMouth</b> sounds like a nice starting premise that needs something interesting to be done with it.  Without a unique goal, it sounds like a Fiasco playset.<br/><br/>Holing up with tempers fraying doesn't address what I find interesting about Anarchists vs Feds.  I already wrote a game that creates the <b>A is for Anarchist</b> dynamics, and no one ever showed any interest.  I think the situation is too specific and limited.  Same for <b>We the Jury</b>.  The only thing that'd grab me here would be novel takes on <i>how</i> these concepts are explored (probably in the form of innovative rules).</blockquote>\n<b>MotorMouth</b> is a random idea that I came up with when I saw that word somewhere and thought What would a game with that title be about? As such it's not a project I'm ranking that highly, but your point about Fiacos playsets is interesting, because a good many game ideas I've had over the last couple of years I eventually rejected when I realised that a Fiasco playset would make a better game, although tbh I thought that, out of the above games, <b>A is for Anarchist</b> would be the one that most people would think would work better as a Fiasco playset. Also, what <i>do</i> you find interesting about Anarchists vs Feds?<br/><br/>Just for the record, my intention for <b>A is for Anarchist</b> is to have things build slowly, and then start to go wrong bit by bit until suddenly Bam! everything falls apart at once and the characters have to suddenly cope with the chaos that's happening, under the pressure of which their personality clashes and character flaws will come into very sharp focus, testing their composure to the limit, so it will be more Tarantino than Coen Brothers.\n<blockquote>I think requests that involve effort are a better metric -- "playtest this" or "review this manuscript" or "help fund this" etc. </blockquote>\nTaking this together with Eero's mention of his design studio, I think tying people into the design process- by doing the things you suggest above, and by turning my publishing business into more of a workshop and perhaps rewarding input that leads very materially to the overall development of the games- is the way to go. <br/><br/>Finally:\n<blockquote>Make games you love because you love them, because they solve problems you have, because they answer a question you have. Maybe they catch on and make you pocket change, maybe they don't, either way you still love them. And it's easy to communicate your enthusiasm for something you genuinely love, which tends to get other people excited, which is what you want. Stop pitching, start making.</blockquote>\nFair enough- will do!!<br/><br/>This thread has given me a lot of what I asked for, and has helped me to clarify my ideas considerably, so thanks to everyone's who's contributed so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429023/#Comment_429023" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T16:54:02+00:00" title="March  2, 2014  4:54PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want a game to work on Leo, do one of mine please: I find publishing them a pain the fundament. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429024/#Comment_429024" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T17:02:06+00:00" title="March  2, 2014  5:02PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2014 5:02PM by catty_big.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Iiiiiiiinteresting...</i> Working on other people's games.

Perhaps a certain degree of RL ineptitude is comedic and endearing, but too much puts their stability, and thus their scientific endeavors, at risk?<br/><br/>I mean, no one at the table cares about the eggs other than for a momentary gag, right?  The question is whether a succession of failures on the egg front <i>matters</i>.  Fetching eggs is probably a bad example; paying rent might be better.  Unless I'm off-base here...\n<blockquote>what <i>do</i> you find interesting about Anarchists vs Feds?</blockquote>If the Anarchists are just assholes, nothing.  But if the Anarchists are acting on relatable principles, then I'm interested in the price of doing what's right in the face of a society and system that may be wrong, or the price of being true to your values vs capitulating.  And all that stuff is tangled up with issues of outside perception, issues of where laws and cultural standards come from, and more.  How can you tell whether your side is right or wrong?  That kind of stuff.  <br/><br/>Also, it's hard to beat the Feds.  Once they're onto you, and you're basically screwed, can you still find a way to get your message out there?  Do you still keep trying?<br/><br/>Holing up in a pressure cooker is cool too, but I'd just as soon play <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> just the way it is in the movie, with criminals who were just in it for the money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429076/#Comment_429076" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T14:56:06+00:00" title="March  3, 2014  2:56PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leo,<br/>  Just to re-iterate, make the games you LOVE.

I've also designed two new games since the above post - <i>SkipJack</i> and <i>Dead Man Talking</i> (the latter of which came about as a result of this thread in fact, a gamer buddy having sent me some suggestions for games I should work on) - and I've done concept doodles for a further two, <i>Priceless</i> (which uses Sci-Fi Beta Kappa's <b>d:merit</b> system) and <i>Burn Baby Burn</i>, which arose out of a casual remark in a thread on G+ a couple of days ago.<br/><br/>All these games are on my <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/103082278441538170721" rel="nofollow">indyhippo design lab G+ community</a>.
