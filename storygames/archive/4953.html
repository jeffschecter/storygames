A time in American history that came to an end on December 5th, 1933. But what might the USA have been like if the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volstead_Act" rel="nofollow">Volstead Act</a> had never disappeared? <br/><br/>Well, to coincide with the anniversary of the repeal of Prohibition, Contested Ground Studios are giving you the change to find out! <b><a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/mob.html" rel="nofollow">Mob Justice</a></b>, written and designed by Iain McAllister, is the game of loyalty, honour and crime in an America where booze it still banned and gangs rule the cities.<br/><br/>This week only, you'll find 20% off the hardcopy and PDF editions of the game at the following outlets:<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/shop.html" rel="nofollow">The Contested Ground Studios web store</a></b><br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16195&amp;cat=257&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a></b><br/><br/><b><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=28726&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">Drive Through RPG</a></b><br/><br/>So, now is the ideal time to break out the sharp suit, check your .45 and get in on the bootlegging action!<br/><br/>If you'd like to know more before you buy, then head over to the Mob Justice pages on our website and check out the free, <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/mobdload.html" rel="nofollow">downloadable preview</a>.<br/><br/>We thought this would be a rather cool themed promotion, rather than simply going "Oh well, here's a discount. Why? Dunno, just felt like it." I've been trying to think of other good gangster/Prohibition themed dates that could be used like this, such as:<br/><br/>The birthday of Al Capone<br/>The St Valentines Day Massacre<br/>The date of the introduction of Prohibition<br/>Something to do with The Untouchables<br/><br/>I know that Fred is beavering away on a holiday season promotion and others have done similar things. Is there a particular feeling in the community about such promotions and timing thereof? <br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
