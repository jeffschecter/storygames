I may have used Acrobat Reader to look up some font names.  This wasn't so much for any deep philosophical reasoning, but it didn't cost me any money.<br/><br/>2) When people tell you that LaTeX is bad for layout they are not lying.  I used it because I could already do some stuff with it, but ended up learning a lot more (I am now the master of boxes!).  While I think the end result looks pretty good, some of it took a lot of effort, and the later pages leave something to be desired regarding text wrapping at the bottom of the pages.<br/><br/>3) I tried to match the style of the original Lady Blackbird as much as possible.  I ripped the border out of the PDF using Inkscape (and modified it for full page use), used the same header font, using FontForge to extract the plus sign looking glyph from the PDF.  I used the same header typeface, but didn't have (or could find for free) the original body typeface.  Instead I used Gentium for reasons that escape me at the reason (perhaps it was getting some love in the type thread on story-games).  Because Gentium doesn't have everything, I also used Gentium Basic for bold, and a smaller size Gentium Book Basic for small caps, which I think actually looks pretty good.  I didn't spend too much time worrying about matching all the point sizes with the original.<br/><br/>4) The traits, tags, keys, and secrets are a pretty exhaustive combination from all the credited games.  For the most part, I tried to remove variants that were just renamed versions from the original Lady Blackbird, possibly incorporate new tags.  Stuff that was added once I started this process (due to new hacks being released, or me finding them) may not follow this as much.  I also trimmed down tag lists that were too long.  I've also added some.<br/><br/>5) Dealing with Creative Commons licenses is interesting.  A quirk I ran into is that BY-SA cannot be combined with BY-NC-SA, which kept me from using some elements I wanted to "steal".  That, some BY-SA stuff I though I would use but didn't in the end, and some BY-NC-ND stuff are why the thing is licensed as a collection.<br/><br/>6) My proficiency at photo editing with the GIMP increased significantly during the project, especially as I graduated to the better methods of cutting an element out of a photo.  However, I did not go back and do the earlier ones better.  This probably shows.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314078/#Comment_314078" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T03:43:30+00:00" title="February 24, 2011  3:43AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2011 7:45AM by Sanglorian.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love it, Tim.

I'm putting it in and will update with it soon.  Sadly, for both lists I had to trim a name or two to make 'em fit.\n<blockquote>EDIT 2: Another thought: did you know that I wrote a little about the Blooded houses and tried to reconcile the Blooded magic system with the other magic systems?

Is that deliberate?</blockquote>\nI don't remember if I saw your efforts regarding the magic system before.  It looks interesting, although much more mechanical than I was going for.  You also interpret Petty Magic different than me.  I take "channeling" to mean that you can use that tag with other tags, but still only one spell tag at a time.  I'd really like to have more Secret-based magic actually, like Warp Blood.  With your stuff there (and the Secret of Stormblood), I don't like the idea of Secrets granting traits and tags.  For the Lady, I think it's okay as a justification for her having an extra trait, but I don't want it messing with advancement or character generation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>I didn't read through it in great detail, but it would be cool to include various stuff in the "setting" and/or "obstacles" information from existing AP reports of Lady Blackbird.

I didn't get in as much on the obstacle front as I planned initially, but almost every hack or thread on the internet about Lady Blackbird I've read and borrowed from.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>This is pretty nice.

I mostly just removed the stuff that obviously didn't fit the Wild Blue setting.<br/>I purposely put the front page comments about ignoring stuff so that if people don't like something they should feel good to ignore it.  Take or leave each page, entry, or even each word as you like.  That's why the titles are like "History and Myth": maybe it's what really happened, maybe it's what people think happened, maybe it's both, maybe it's neither.  That's why there are checkboxes next to each rule.  That's why there are two contradictory descriptions of goblins one after the another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quizoid" title="Quizoid"><img alt="Quizoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quizoid">Quizoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332607/#Comment_332607" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T21:40:19+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  9:40PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our group has really enjoyed Lady Blackbird.

He lets it go when he sees how old the woman in the painting is now.<br/>\nNaomi: Hired by Flint to personally protect the painting en route.  She succeeded.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe're excited to give these rules a go, especially the character creation.  However in the "additional and optional rules," section, it doesn't really say which rules are additional and which are optional.

I don't want any arguing, or anybody thinking that you <i>have</i> to use certain ones.  Note there are little checkboxes next to each rule.  If you're using it, put a check in it.  If not, don't.  Some of them are more advice than rules, and you can pretty much take or leave anything.<br/><br/>The only real exception is the alternate dice rolling method, which is why it's after the art.\n<blockquote>Also, I was confused by this line: "To take Master Sorcerer or any blooded trait you must have a relevant Secret, otherwise you\u2019re relegated to magic that only uses one spell tag at a time."<br/><br/>Whispblood and Petty Magic are in the clear, because they come under that "one spell tag at a time" rule.

Lady Blackbird has a Secret related to her spellcasting (which doesn't actually <i>do</i> anything, while Kale doesn't and is limited to one spell tag at a time.  <br/><br/>For conciseness, I don't list a bunch of different versions of the same Secret.  So modify The Secret of Stormblood to whatever name you want that matches the type of *blood that you have.  So you may have The Secret of Stoneblood.  Something like The Secret of Warpblood may or may not qualify, depending on what you and your group think about it.  My inclination is either no, or it allows multiple spell tags on the weaker bloods, but not the purer ones.  So it may work for Wispblood and Dustblood, but not Stormblood and Stoneblood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
