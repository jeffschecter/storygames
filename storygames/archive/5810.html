In other words do you get your intended action in addition to the consequence?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>2</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a limit to the number of people you can force to answer your roll in a conflict with multiple people? We had someone object when a monster attacked three people at once in a conflict, injuring all three of them. The rules certainly seem like you can ask as many people to answer as you like.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>3</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHow should you handle a conflict where someone comes in halfway through, e.g. someone doesn't get involved to start with, but then jumps in on the second round. Do they just participate for the 2 remaining rounds? Does an advantage dice gained in the first round still count against them, even though it was gained against a different person? We assumed it did, an advantage dice was an advantage dice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130008/#Comment_130008" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T14:30:28+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  2:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

Someone else might come along and contradict me and be right.<br><br>1) Winning a conflict doesn't give you the right to prevent anyone from doing anything, so you shouldn't start one with the idea that you're going to. Rather, you can either get the other person to agree to not doing that thing during post-conflict negotiation, or you can exhaust / injure them in order to make the next conflict when you stop them easier.<br><br>Basically, conflict is like hitting someone with a stick. You don't hit someone with a stick and then they instantly stop doing whatever they wanted to do. You hit them with a stick, they go "ow!" and then say "stop what you're doing or I'll give you another one."<br><br>2) As long as you can justify it in the fiction, no. So if my demon of pain goes "I screech with the horror of a thousand undiscovered hells, and all of your heads explode" that's something everyone who can hear it has to answer.<br><br>How did you end up with a monster in Wicked, btw? I thought that all it had was animals, demons, gods, and people?<br><br>3) I don't believe someone can jump into a conflict midway (though this one I'm uncertain about). You're better off just rolling for anyone who might be involved. They can always bail if they don't have anything to do. Something I found useful as a GM was to get everyone at the table into conflict at the same time. Often it would start in neat little pairs, but rapidly people found ways to cross over.<br><br>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130012/#Comment_130012" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T14:47:07+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  2:47PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Re 1</b> Let me give you a more concrete example<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a character who was a kid (well actually an animated statue the size of a boy), and was trying to run out of a house. Another character grabbed him and tried to throw him in a room. The second character wins the conflict. Are you saying the kid can say "You injure me and I still get out"? That doesn't sound right. I'm pretty sure the other character would just have said "I grab him again" and that would have seemed justified to me. After all if you grabbed him and threw him in the room in round 3, how do you justify getting out?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Re 2</b> It was a monstrous animal really. We had the girl with the soul of a leopard and ended up with a monstrous leopard without a soul called Amok.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Re 3</b> I agree that it seemed a bit suspect, but it kept coming up, people saying "Oh I don't get involved unless he looks like he is hurting her" and then a conflict escalating midway into violence and them getting involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich raises another question, is it actually possible to help someone? You can't give the person you are helping a bonus, and nothing stops the aggressor targeting both you and your helper at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130014/#Comment_130014" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T14:53:12+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  2:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Are you saying the kid can say "You injure me and I still get out"?</blockquote>\nYes\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I'm pretty sure the other character would just have said "I grab him again"</blockquote>\nSure.

Sometimes the forms being used by the original participants seemed wrong, because they would have responded to the third person differently. Also the advantage dice seemed odd, if character A gains an advantage dice over B because he has B pinned to the ground, and then C leaps into attack A, it seems odd for A to have an advantage dice over C too. Not overwhelmingly odd, but odd.<br/><br/>I think it was a bad symptom of people trying to hedge their bets and not get involved until they knew how things were going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130020/#Comment_130020" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T15:05:30+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  3:05PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Oh, let me add: by the same token, "I'm injured instead" doesn't mean that the kid has escaped.

A and B vs C, C needs dice to favour twice.  The same intial round that "knocks A out" and ends A vs C only, leaves B in to still possibly win.
