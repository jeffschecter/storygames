Jesus, it's been 27 years since that movie came out. Anyway.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1318/1454031202_59a042826c_o.jpg"/><br/><br/>So, Lord Humungus has a pistol:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.kzmu.org/photos/shows/large/humungus2.jpg"/><br/><br/>When he retrieves the pistol, he doesn't just pull a revolver out of a sling. He opens a crafted wooden box. Inside the box is a red velvet lining, holding the pistol, six bullets each individually placed (IIRC), and a small photograph next to a medal of some kind.<br/><br/>This scene lasts all of like 3-4 seconds. But that little tidbit just... wow. There's a story there. What was he before the wars? Who are the people in the photograph? How did he win the award? Did his military experience (if that's what it came from) lead to his demeanor?<br/><br/>So I'm trying to think of games that would reward little descriptions, little tidbits like that. Off the top of my head, I think of Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, and Wushu, each which would reward the player describing the little detail with a bonus die to the die pool.<br/><br/>What other ways are there to encourage these little tidbits of description, not integral to play, but enhance what's going on nonetheless. <br/><br/>Fan mail? (Fan mail is the answer to everything. At least, it is for me anyway)<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174126/#Comment_174126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:45:40+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:45AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Battle mats! <br/><br/>One track fucking mind right now...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174128/#Comment_174128" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:47:21+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:47AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 11:47AM by Marshall Burns.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Sorcerer</i>, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174135/#Comment_174135" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:52:56+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Well, speaking of one track minds...</p>\n<p>Supercrew has a once per session anecdote bonus.

But I think that seeing the mechanic effect from rewards such as Fan Mail in <i>Primetime Adventures</i> or Bonus Dice in <i>Sorcerer</i> as what the "reward" is about misses the boat.<br><br/>In my view, the purpose of Fan Mail and Bonus Dice is <i>acknowledgment</i>.  It's stopping the game a half-beat and saying, "Hey, that was cool.  Thanks."  It's a social moment, and while the color and detail for the story is cool, and the mechanical bonus for the mechanic is cool, that social aspect is really the important part.  It's no different than, say, a group of writers sitting around a table breaking a TV episode and someone tossing out an idea and getting a laugh or a chill from the group and one person pointing at the person who offered the idea and going, "Excellent."                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174178/#Comment_174178" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T14:18:15+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  2:18PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh very much so, and it's a lovely way to do it, that can avoid the less-sincere bonus giving that more traditional games often leave to the GM, who generally gets to hand out small bonuses for this sort of thing.<br/><br/>A lot of traditional game designs handle this acknowledgment for detail (amongst other things) with bonus XP, which rather defers the acknowledgment till the end of the game                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174188/#Comment_174188" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T14:54:12+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  2:54PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>A lot of traditional game designs handle this acknowledgment for detail (amongst other things) with bonus XP, which rather defers the acknowledgment till the end of the game</blockquote>\nThat's a good and interesting point!<br/><br/>The "XP at the End" model is a kind of intellectualized summation made by the GM of all play reaching back two to eight hours.

I know that the people who are always adding detail do it because they like doing it, and continue to do it even in games where there's no official reward for doing so.  And the people who rarely add detail (once every few sessions at most, and only when the mood strikes them or when it's particularly meaningful to them) are annoyed by systems which seem to require them to add detail or get screwed over.<br/><br/>But it's possible, I suppose, that getting bonuses was a gateway drug for the "always detail" people, the thing that convinced them that they should try it in the first place.  There's probably a trick to making the mechanics encourage and reward that sort of thing without making them so integral to the entire system that people who don't like it are forcibly pushed away from the game.  (The way Exalted tied stunting to getting Essence back was a huge turnoff to our "I'll provide details when I feel like it's important" crowd, for example.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174458/#Comment_174458" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T08:20:04+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  8:20AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Related thread maybe:  <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3350" rel="nofollow">Dance, Monkey, Dance!"</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I know I've had them myself GM-ing <i>Sorcerer</i>.<br/><br/>I think people can play that way.  I think the social situation at the table might encourage it, and after that, it's up to the people to realize they're behaving like students raising their hand to make a good impression on their fellow students or the teacher.  This means that a game of <i>Primetime Adventures</i> or <i>Sorcerer</i> can end up full of Dancing Monkeys.  <i>Who</i> distributes the dice then, doesn't matter one whit.  If people are striving, they are striving.  But I think that misses what Fan Mail or Bonus Dice are for, which is a Thank You from the table, not a brass ring to be grabbed.<br/><br/>For anyone who is interested, two thread started on this topic last week about Bonus Dice for Sorcerer:  <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26839.0" rel="nofollow">How do you award Bonus Dice for Roleplaying?</a> and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26817.0" rel="nofollow">Bonus Dice Questions</a><br/><br/>In particular, this passage from the second linked thread is pertinent: <br/><br/>"[The purpose of Bonus Dice]... is not consensus, it's connection. Bonus dice are about experiencing a sudden increase in the Shared quality of Shared Imagined Space. They're not about being entertained in a purely 'did you meet my standards well enough' sense..."<br/><br/>And here's a thread from last year on the matter: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26839.0" rel="nofollow">[Sorcerer] How do you award Bonus Dice for roleplaying</a>, which contains this:\n<blockquote>You, as Sorcerer GM, are not the judge of quality role-playing. You should instead consider yourself the voice of the group engagement. When someone does something that makes anyone or everyone react in an engaged, heightened way, it's worth a bonus die or two.<br/><br/>That's all. So you're not saying, "Gee, I'm stroking my chin and deciding whether you're 'acting' well enough." Instead, you're saying, "Wow! Cool!" or seeing someone else say that (or nod, or smile, or grunt, whatever) and then remembering that it's worth a bonus die. Fanmail in Primetime Adventures is at least partly derived from this concept in Sorcerer - the rule is based on acknowledging that something said or done by person A resulted, right there and then, in enjoyment for person B or persons-everyone-else. Given that perspective, bonus dice are not add-ons for something extra, but a recognition for what's already happening.<br/><br/>Also, bonus dice in Sorcerer are not about long, drawn-out, extravagant descriptions of actions. They usually get applied because of the quality of a given stated action, which includes its timing. Here's an analogy from film: in the first Indiana Jones movie, a guy comes running at Indy to kill him with a sword, doing all sorts of crazy whirly sword-moves. Indy grimaces in a kind of "oh come on" way, pulls his gun, and shoots him. My point is that in role-playing, an equivalent reaction and stated action typically make at least one other person at the table cry out or smile-and-nod or otherwise react in a positive way, because their fun just increased. That's what you, as GM, are keeping an eye out for, with yourself as a possible reactor as well.<br/><br/>I also suggest that the concern about bonus dice and successful rolling is ... well, group-specific. I really cannot say whether those dice matter in terms of successful rolling. Or rather, yes, they matter in a statistical sense (if present, the chance goes up), but not necessarily in the sense of whether the character succeeds adequately for purposes of enjoying play. So my recommendation is to let that take care of itself during play and not to anticipate it or try to manage it.<br/><br/>Does any of that help you get around some of the objections that you (rightly) are bringing up about GM-rewards for "good" role-playing?</blockquote>\nAnd specifically covering the issue of group distribution of Awesome Dice vs. the GM rewarding them (which is brought up in the other thread) it says this:\n<blockquote>Why is the GM the authority (not gatekeeper) for this function I'm describing? Because the GM also has a key authoritative role over Humanity rolls of both kinds, and the key playing-character role of playing the demons. These latter two things are central leadership features in Sorcerer which rely on the GM's personal commitment to the most intense, adverse, and honest play possible, mainly because he or she does not root for the player-characters, does not ensure that they come out of a given scenario all right, and does not mollycoddle the players into ego-escape trips instead of author-level pressure.<br/><br/>As such an adverse presence at the table as far as the fictional characters are concerned, this same person takes on the positive role of acknowledging the players as far as the real people are concerned. The two levels (real, fictional) are each made more extreme, freed to be more extreme, for that person. <br/><br/>In these days of Primetime Adventures, Polaris, my own It Was a Mutual Decision, and other games based on group-ish, mix-it-up, decentralized play, it might be hard to see why the GM is so centralized in Sorcerer ... but here's the point (and it relates to your second question, too): in Sorcerer, there is no "GM's story." It doesn't exist; it cannot exist. So what does the GM actually do? He or she provides the back-story, plays the demons and other NPCs, and ... (a) increases fictional pressure at the same time as (b) acknowledging and formally validating real-person fun. That a/b is a unique thing; it's part of Sorcerer's design. Nothing in the game is there only because I was used to it or thought it "must" be there.</blockquote>\nI think Ron's comments about Bonus Dice being about <i>connection</i> is the point of Awesome Dice.  For me, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174511/#Comment_174511" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T14:55:43+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  2:55PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

The only thing about Minutiae is that they reverse the process, adding a detail to the world is a cost of using the extra die, rather than the die being a bonus for adding the detail.
