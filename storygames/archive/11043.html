I find the Duel of Wits to be an interesting and exciting way to resolve important debates and arguements, while simple social skill tests take care of the rest.<br/><br/>Also, Belief driven characters help out too.<br/><br/>In fact, one of the demo scenarios on the BW website is based around an Elven diplomatic envoy  arriving to negotiate with a newly crowned Dwarven king. Of course, it often ends in violence, but the social intrigue often comes pretty heavy too.<br/><br/>That said, there's LOTS of other systems out there that could do about the same thing. I can second what Wilhelm said about Housed of the Blooded.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh yeah, BW stories are heavily GM guided, but they are based on the characters perusing their Beliefs in play. Players can also use "wise" skills like "court gossip-wise" to narrate facts about the setting and situation. For example, a successful court gossip-wise test could establish that "Duke Rolf has a secret lover amongst his kitchen staff," or something similar.<br/><br/>Finally, since you want players to have greater influence on NPCs I should mention that Burning Wheel has a mechanic called "Circles" which represents a characters social connections and can be used to locate NPCs of the players choosing. This includes inventing new NPCs. Last BW session I played I had a character roll circles to find "an Elven spy who knows if the Sultan is rearming the north eastern mountain fortresses." He failed the roll, which means that the Elven spy (who did not previously exist) now knows the PC is looking for him and is suspicious of it. Basically, (at the GM's discression) the test can indicate how helpful the NPC is and not if he exists or not.<br/><br/>Does that sound something like what you are looking for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245345/#Comment_245345" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T08:00:25+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  8:00AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can someone describe (or point a link to a detailed description) how Houses of the Blooded's social stuff works?<br/><br/>I second Damnation City for Vampire, if you're doing a WoD-rules game: It has this massive social combat and influence system where you can punch people in the face with Politics, Connections and Media and the like. It's real moving and shaking "conspiracies and princes of the city" level stuff, though, not quite as good for simple but lengthy social fights at the smaller scale (convincing a middleman to let you pass, etc).<br/><br/>BW's social combat/Duel of Wits is really solid IMO.<br/><br/>The most "rules supporting the social action" that I've personally gotten out of a game was in Shadow over Yesterday's "Bringing Down the Pain" mechanic. The first conflict i ever issued in that game we had a long "art contest... to the death!" complete with social conniving, intrigue, conspiracy and of course basic art skill-rolls, which at the time was as gritty and epic as any massive combat.

And if you need more detail for aesthetic reasons, or in order to accomplish something that wouldn't feel right to do with just one roll, you can used the "Bringing Down the Pain/Extended Conflict" rules to go blow-by-blow (or snark-by-snark), with a "how much will you risk to win" sort of thing that is very intense.<br/><br/>So, anyway, just a suggestion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Bunyip" title="The Bunyip"><img alt="The Bunyip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/758/nIGUP7BK8UEFU.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Bunyip">The Bunyip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245454/#Comment_245454" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T00:51:41+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 12:51AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The new <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> RPG looks to gave some interesting mechanics for what it calls intrigue (seduce, taunt, convince, etc).

Then be actively interested in doing the same with NPCs and following up with NPC reactions and "world" consequences for the choices both the PC and NPCs make to influence.  <br/>It's called role-playing.  <br/><br/>To help understand HOW to Game Master for these sorts of things you could reference any of the dozens of motivational type books for business.  <br/><br/>My primary suggestion though is to build a world  (and NPCs)  that don't "actively" plot in terms of your story need...  Build NPCs and world events that set the PCs  (the "heroes" of the story)  into conflict but not "plots".  Give the world events and NPC actions/reactions the type of choices that are natural to THEIR personality.  I try to build NPC personalities in-that I never "need" to make a plot.  I simply need to interpret their choice and role-play it.  Same with the world events.  Make the choice on the direction the story will take -  then use the NPCs and world environment to naturally express those events through their established personalities or style.  <br/>In other words - build your world so that it runs the intrigue and social events FOR you.  Let the NPCs run themselves.  Once you have established the style of personality,  you can just sit back and react to the PCs choices naturally.  For having the NPCs (or world) make active choices  (for what PCs will learn that's happening)  listen to what the PLAYERS are asking or discussing regarding the situation or NPC,  then "react" actively....  <br/>Example:  if my players are talking casually about an NPC and they question "Why is he doing that, do you think he will...?"   THEN  you make the choice based on the NPC's established personality.<br/><br/>In a strange way...<br/>To get great intrigue and political situations I build the NPC and let  THEM  run me.<br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245635/#Comment_245635" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T19:48:56+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  7:48PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what my friend will find interesting.  I talked to him about it today.  What I got out of it was, he likes the idea of having a character, or perhaps a small cast of characters, that start off in a kingdom/city/starship.  The city would be created by the players.  (I envision this as a list of traits like "Trade City" and "Lawless eastern district") <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, observations about my friend.<br/>\n1) His favorite game is Mage<br/>\n2) But he's always making D&amp;D character for fun (I think he likes the 'shopping magazine' approach to char gen)<br/>\n3) In a recent game, he had his character poison a little girl who had just become an orphan. He explained to me that since his character was an orphan, his character thought it was more humane for her to die peacefully than be an orphan.  He then described how the guilt was going to drive his character insane, that he was going to become totally detached from his emotions and that he would be retiring his character in a few sessions. I've played many Indy games, but this was very surprising to me, because at the time we were playing D&amp;D (and that and White Wolf is pretty much all he has played)<br/>\n4) He routinely tries to start up organizations and become the local tyrant<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say a game about intrigue, I imagine something like the book series "A Song of Ice and Fire". When I say I want the game to put more control into the player's hands, well this is entirely selfish.  I don't want to spend much time prepping for the game. Especially because when I run for my friend, my preparation becomes meaningless 30 minutes into the game.  Then I have to run by the seat of my pants, which I find exhausting and irritating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI almost feel like this sort of game would be best run competitively. I'm kind of imagining a game where each player is a noble household competing for control of the city. Each player would have their "Head" and a supporting cast of other characters.  The GM would play the part of the citizenry and other competing households. They would have to build influence in the city.  But limit the influence of the other houses.  They could try to kill each other's supporting cast, but failed assassination attempts would make you lose influence.  Otherwise, they have to sling mud at the other people and make them lose face. Perhaps the GM is the king choosing his next heir, and the players have to compete for his attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to start finding out information about these other games that have been mentioned and see if any of them will work for what I'm imagining.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKevperrine,<br/>\nIn my mind, using the right system lessens the burden of being Game Master.  I could, in theory, use D&amp;D for something like this.  But I've made game systems before and extensive house rules, and I'm not really interested in forcing games to do my bidding... I'd rather have a game that naturally develops the play that I'm looking for, if I can find it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245686/#Comment_245686" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T06:39:52+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  6:39AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David C</cite>When I say a game about intrigue, I imagine something like the book series "A Song of Ice and Fire".<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I'm kind of imagining a game where each player is a noble household competing for control of the city.

I don't think it provides 100% of what you're looking for, but it does have social conflicts and management of noble houses as a gameplay mechanic.<br/><br/>Personally I'd go with Burning Wheel (I know, I'm repeating myself) to run A Song of Ice and Fire, but it doesn't have any mechanics for running a House. You'd have to homebrew that aspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245688/#Comment_245688" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T06:47:20+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  6:47AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I would go with In A Wicked Age.<br/><br/>See, social intrigue and manipulation involves threats that, usually, don't come to pass, right?  You don't want to outright kill or ruin someone (most of the time), you want them to do something specific, to help with your ambitions.  You can either do this with incentives, or you can threaten to do something to them, even if the threat is completely veiled.<br/><br/>IAWA does this wonderfully with threats.  You have a conflict, someone wins, and they say: Do x for me, or I'll damage your dice, which makes it less likely you'll get what you want next time.  That way you can constantly manipulate people to get the fictional outcome you want, without ever actually getting your hands dirty.  (I once made a quick one-sheet system system based on IAWA (and Sorcerer and others) that you can <a href="http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=14" rel="nofollow">check out here</a>.)  I'd allow "holding" the threat, though, until the negotiated deed is done.  Because in intrigue, unlike in sword and sorcery, you don't do everything on the spot, and broken promises have consequences.<br/><br/>There's also <a href="http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=15" rel="nofollow">this game</a> that I'm developing, but it's not quite ready for testing yet.

Literary intrigue and high adventure (space opera themed - but easy enough to adjust) with heavy world building and PCs enabled to bring in a cast of thousands to aid them in the action. <br/><br/>The one short-fall here is that you don't have an accountant's view of your house in the rise and fall of your resources, but rather a story's view, with the moment to moment changes in fortune. And the fact that I'm still working out some of the kinks.<br/><br/>I was really hoping you'd say you wanted a game that supports really fun social mechanics. I could have suggested Dying Earth, among a few other options. Every time I've run something like what you are describing before I've literally designed the system from scratch as I was playing, sharply customized to exactly what the players wanted to do and freeformed as much as possible.

My favorite bit is that fight outcomes are not necessarily life or death; you can negotiate (or the winner can determine) outcomes like "ransomed" or "has to take the black" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  That means no unnecessary character death, and in fact losing a fight can recreate consequences seen in the novels.

It will mean that it'll be like running a country, at least, that's how we played it. The social rules weren't really anything related to interpersonal intrigue, but rather the rolls your company will make toward the bigger outcome. Companies (countries, organizations) become NPCs, so each Company has to be detailed in stats by you, the GM. That, my husband found, was pretty time consuming. But, it is awesome to play a game on that scale.<br/><br/>If you're looking for more interpersonal drama and politicking, I would go for <b>Legend of the Five Rings</b>. Japanese cultural etiquette galore, as far as the setting and genre is concerned. I hear that other BW game does it well too, falling blossoms whatnot, and burning sands. Also, <b>Spirit of the Century</b>, as noted above, has a social system that works exactly like a combat system, you have a certain amount of hit points allocated to social stats that you can take before you lose the argument. You can use aspects and effectively "stunt" your argument in really fun ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247703/#Comment_247703" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-20T21:48:13+00:00" title="December 20, 2009  9:48PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly, the most political game I ever participated in was the Old World of Darkness <i>Werewolf</i>.
