I remember reading an ad in Dragon regarding rolling a 1 when your hero was ready to kill the big bad, and how the SAGA System didn't have that problem. It intrigued me, but I was sadly not a Dragonlance fan, so I didn't pick it up. I say sadly because it's a really cool system.<br/><br/>It seems there were 3 branches from 2e. Alternity, basically Sci-Fi AD&amp;D, 3e and SAGA System remind me of the movie Twins, 3e split off the tactical combat aspect of 2e and distilled it, while SAGA System split off the narrative role playing aspect of 2e and distilled it - and that's pretty much the part of 2e that got emphasized when I played. <br/><br/>First off, character generation. It's a sort of random process, you draw 12 cards form the included deck, and allocate them to various stats. The first few times it was a rather long process, and I didn't pull off terribly good results. I eventually got the hang of it, and started being able to work through things more quickly, but it felt like throwing together a character in GURPS. Immediately what strikes me based on this is that it was a game designed for 2e players - it's not all that newbie friendly. I say this because really the only race that's easy to put together is Human - the restrictions on the other races makes it hard to do something well. My girlfriend read Dragonlance and was a fan of Kender, and she'd have definitely been dealing with a sub-optimal character had she gotten through the process. For me though, it was fun. You get to pretty much make the character concept you wanted, having the balancing and somewhat fiddly bits reminiscent of a point buy game, but it's also over much quicker, and the random aspect of it keeps the whole process from creating cookie cutter characters. Also a rather nice characteristic is that if you play a "good" character, you end up a bit more powerful than an "evil" one. SAGA  System doesn't have alignments, rather Nature and Demeanor, which I find to be more interesting.<br/><br/>Really the big thing I like about it is the process is quick. I do need a sheet of scrap paper to handle the tweaks, but it's only one step. After that, the character is pretty much done, and character creation is an under-30 minute process. The way I've been playing 2e lately I've stripped out a lot of the rules, and things are roughly as fast, but even with everything stripped out, SAGA System requires less to be written on the character sheet. I really like that - everything fits comfortably on an A5 sheet that would easily fit in the included box.<br/><br/>Something I feel was done really well was effectively integrating classes into the ability scores (via ability codes). If you want, you've pretty much got a good chunk of classes and kits from 2e with the right ability codes, and unlike 2e, you can benefit from heavy armour while having a low strength (or in this case, endurance) score. It also allows for far more customisation to fit your character concept, and in a complete reversal of 2e - the Humans actually are the most versatile and can pull off the equivalent of multiclassing much better. The result is that humans are very diverse, while the other races will tend to be more homogeneous.<br/><br/>Game play I haven't gotten too far through. No combat yet. I really do like the Fate Deck though. There's a fair amount of information on the cards, so if I want something to be randomly decided, I flip over a card and interpret it. For example 1-3 are white, 4-6 are red, 7-9 are black, for good, neutral and evil. I wanted to see what the weather would be like, flipped it over and got a 10 (the odd exception, still black), and decided it was one of the worst storms ever. Ask a question, flip card, interpret. It's like having random tables to roll on, but without having to check the tables. It certainly makes it inherrently much easier to GM. The advice for Narrators is also quite good, I haven't gotten around to doing a designed adventure, or using one of the published ones (doesn't entirely suit the characters we have going), but I like what I see. Definitely something I wish I'd seen in the DMG.<br/><br/>Resolution is pretty easy. For the most part the target number is known (it's ability score + card value vs target number), so success is pretty much guaranteed - unless the player doesn't care much either way about the outcome. It's similar to having action points, or something similar to be able to make sure what you want to happen really does happen, but it's just integrated into the card system. What I also like is that experience and damage is integrated into the cards too. Probably the thing I hate most about hit points is the hole that gets erased in your character sheet - not a concern at all with SAGA System. Advancement is also pretty straight forward with eventually increasing your hand size.<br/><br/>Conceptually I really like how that works. As you gain experience, rather than having your absolute capability increase, your average capability increases. Anyone has a chance of doing very well, but a more experienced hero is more likely to do well. It's like comparing 3d6 which offers scores of 3-18, to 4d6 drop the lowest, which still gives you 3-18, but with a bias towards higher numbers. Damage has a pseudo death spiral built in - your absolute ability doesn't go down, just as you lose cards from your hand, your odds overall go down and you have less control. You still get the pressure that a death spiral would bring in, but it doesn't have the annoyance that whoever gets hit first will pretty much lose. You still have the chance to pull off a big comeback. I've read that the combat system seems to break a bit when fighting creatures with high physique scores. I'm not sure if I think this is a big problem. It makes big monsters suitably dangerous to everyone, and makes acquiring magic weapons much more significant. That's obviously a YMMV issue.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very happy with it. I like 2e, and SAGA System is pretty much everything that I like about 2e. Given it's been out of print for a decade, concerns of how it would be for new players are quite moot, but I do get the feeling that a Dragonlance fan who would have picked it up without knowing D&amp;D might have been a little lost. <br/><br/>Somewhat off topic, but I noticed that things included in Alternity and SAGA System skipped 3e entirely and then showed up in 4e. In SAGA System it's checking against static numbers (which is pretty much the core mechanic) and it crops up in 4e as defense scores instead of saving throws. It's rather interesting to see conventions that were adopted at TSR before d20 were initially entirely ignored.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263692/#Comment_263692" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T11:07:43+00:00" title="March 23, 2010 11:07AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ended up picking up a copy of 5th Age for like $5 at a used bookstore.

I liked the basic set-up of the system, and could have seen giving it a go. But I'm no Dragonlance fan, so I couldn't get over the recycled character art on the cards. Also, there were too many D&amp;D-isms lurking in the system that really had no reason to be there except to make play more D&amp;D-like. For instance, a separation between  Sorcerous and Shamanistic magic when the sub-systems for both were so sketchy the distinction was pointless.

I find the Marvel version a superior version (stacked deck, better handling of damage.) Though I think 5th Age was good for its own game when it came out. I never liked Dragonlance (I know I know) I tried reading books again when the game came out and found the game more suitable than the novels. I used it for several fantasy games with original worlds. The card art faded from memory in play and mostly just the numbers and auras were important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did find the ease of getting heavily armored spellcasters a bit problematic for play--especially since they could easily overshadow the more physical only heroes. (Having an extra set of abilities others don't have means one more option to make cards in your hand more useful.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of what I learned from that and Marvel Saga, I'm putting towards my own A.C.E system. (Action Card Engine.) Though finding something usable like nature and demeanor has been a chore. (I've got Fury and Fury triggers--since the game is meant for action-mecha games, not introspective mecha games.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264244/#Comment_264244" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-27T20:32:37+00:00" title="March 27, 2010  8:32PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought Mysticism and Sorcery were split up well enough. One is only for the non-living and the other is only for the living. Plus, if you want to play a D&amp;D style game, the system works quite nicely. It makes for interesting challenges if you have max ability codes with certain races.<br/><br/>Good point about armoured spellcasters. Of course that was something people complained about for ages with D&amp;D, but it is a rather necessary balancing mechanic. I found in general it was easy to get a lot of As and Bs if you were playing a human, but there would be some pretty low scores as a result. If you had to play a race with some restrictions, it got pretty easy to drop ability codes and increase the scores. It's one of the few systems though as a result where humans actually are more versatile, rather than having some artificial kludge thrown in to make it seem like they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264277/#Comment_264277" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T12:26:27+00:00" title="March 28, 2010 12:26PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played this game, using different settings (one of them a months-long <i>Thief</i>-esque campaign), and I have fond memories of the system.

Still, I really dig the options it gives to players and the way damage was dealt was clever. I keep meaning to go back to it for a one-shot or something similar, but never do. The design of the cards hasn't aged real well, I'm sorry to say. <br/><br/>I may be able to dig up some of the old house rules and play options we whipped up back in the day.

I now know reasons not to do that (sometimes) but I sure loved that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264625/#Comment_264625" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T05:42:15+00:00" title="March 31, 2010  5:42AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What reasons were those Ry?<br/>\nJust wondering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264638/#Comment_264638" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T07:23:03+00:00" title="March 31, 2010  7:23AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a topic for another thread, or maybe a blog post.

But I agree the thing that really did never seem to work was that the biggest, baddest creatures were completely unstoppable. Get a big dragon or a mighty giant, and suddenly the characters have to run for the hills because the rules didn't have an allowance (as far as we were able to find) for combating such foes. Not even a way to find that gap in the scales where a well-placed arrow would fell the great beast. And that kinda killed it.<br/>But up until that point, we had LOVED the Saga system. Comparatively freeform characters, no set classes, make your own spells. These were things that really caught our attention and imagination, and we tried to hack as much as we could into D&amp;D 2nd Ed (mostly the magic). But we were all kinda disappointed to have to make the switch.<br/>I'm thinking that with the rise of story gaming, the collective creative minds here should be able to take those rules, and fix them so they work.<br/><br/>For a while I was trying to hack Dragonlance Saga with the rolling system of Feng Shui...which may work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277114/#Comment_277114" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T11:47:45+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 11:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not used SAGA for DL, but the Marvel version is one of my favorites.<br/><br/>The trump system actually allows for finding the weakness in the bad guy better than regular D&amp;D.

We had a lot of fun, but I suspect if I pulled it out today I wouldn't like it as much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdcore" title="nerdcore"><img alt="nerdcore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdcore">nerdcore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278822/#Comment_278822" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T12:37:22+00:00" title="June 30, 2010 12:37PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still think that the 5th age a great potencial.<br/>\nIt crossed my mind running some itteration of Ravenloft on the saga ruleset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278831/#Comment_278831" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T13:03:42+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  1:03PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nerdcore</cite>It crossed my mind running some itteration of Ravenloft on the saga ruleset.</blockquote>\nActually, once upon a time, in the old Dragon Magazine, they did indeed have a mini-supplement for converting Ravenloft into the Saga system.

If you were really experienced you'd have a pretty large hand to work with and would be guaranteed either a high number or a trump card for when you needed it.

The cool thing with DL5A is they both got it equally well, although for different reasons. My girlfriend liked playing cards based on the picture and who was named (she loved reading Dragonlance novels). My brother had read a couple Dragonlance novels (Legend of Huma, maybe one other), and he was looking at things from a crunchy and tactical perspective. <br/><br/>Something that came out is pretty high success rate, I think there was only one failure in a task, and it wasn't a big deal. Generally it came down to problem solving and then carrying it out, without having chance screw things up, although we weren't dealing with anything massively difficult. It really went over well. I remember what got my attention for Dragonlance 5th Age was an ad in Dragon Magazine that said something along the lines of "Your hero has the chance to kill the villain once and for all, oh crap, he rolled a 1" and to play the SAGA system instead.
