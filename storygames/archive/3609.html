Describe a real-world culture/civilization/whatchamacallit in 1,000 words or less, for the purposes of a role-playing game.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompleted sketches may be posted in this thread.  Criticisms of fact or tone of a piece may be posted in this thread as well. Questions about the challenge <i>should be sent as whispers</i>; I promise to respond to questions within a couple of days.  (I don't have access to S-G at my internship, so please be patient.)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You don't have to be a member of the culture/civilization/whatever, but that should be clear in your entry.<br/>\n1A.  Use of fiction strictly forbidden.  Relevant autobiography, however, is allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. You damn sure better not promote racism, stereotypes, or engage in all that post-imperial bullshit.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. You also better not cater to fanboy stereotypes, to the extent it can be avoided.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Your facts, to the extent you include facts, should be accurate, though I'm fine with some fuzziness.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  The "size" of the subject matter is up to you.  Where possible, however, I would prefer the description to cover as many people as applicable.  If you end up describing the people on a particular island in Micronesia, for example, odds are pretty good it might cover many other Micronesian cultures if you squint real hard.  I would prefer to stay away from ridiculously narrow subgroups ("bisexual dyslexics on Lexington Avenue in Midtown"), because it defeats the challenge of using 1000 words for a really difficult topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n5B. The absurdity of the project is assumed; you don't have to apologize or defend your sketch.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. You can pick a historical period, though, including Modern Day ___________.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Due date is Labor Day, 2007.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.  System-specific material (Shadow of Yesterday keys, Sorcerer demons, Primetime Adventure series bibles, OGL prestige classes, etc.) should not be avoided, but you can offer a 200 word sidebar if you're really psyched about something.<br/>\n<br/>\nREVISION (7/14/07) - If this ends up in a physical form, or warehoused somewhere on the Net, information submitted will be under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike license, permitting others to modify the material so long as they include a similar license on their work.  If people would like to discuss the merits of various licensing schemes, I am all ears.

Advertisers can "pay" for the product with a receipt of donation to the UNESCO World Heritage Organization (or, in case we change our minds, an organization with a similar mandate).  The product will then be sold at/near cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound good?

Still, something like this, geared for a less diverse group than "Asia", might be one way to go about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/race/kara-tur-life.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/race/kara-tur-life.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Gygax's text isn't necessarily an endorsement of his views or scholarship (real or putative, I don't know) - whether you wish to use it as a positive or negative role model for your own entries is entirely up to you.  (I'd love to see something almost exactly the opposite of this, in fact.)  I only include it because this text was far more helpful for gaming purposes than the 300 page "Kara-Tur Campaign Setting" published about five years later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
