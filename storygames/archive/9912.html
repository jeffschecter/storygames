We had one big mech combat at the beginning of the campaign, and usually had a big battle at the end of every "chapter" of the game - usually every 4 sessions or so.<br/><br/>We did spend a lot of time out of our mechs. We still had fun because we treated the game as a futuristic thriller/military action game, which just happened to have mechs in it. One character was trapped behind enemy lines and had to make deals with criminals and religious fanatics to try to get back home, another was trying to scam money to improve his mech, another was a POW trying to integrate into Clan society. We had tense drama, some action and car chases, and a bit of political intrigue. Things were pretty interesting. In a sense, Mechs were a (admittedly big) color/setting element rather than the driving force behind the game.<br/><br/>Naturally there are plenty of other ways to run a mech RPG. I hope we can hear about them here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220307/#Comment_220307" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T10:20:00+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 10:20AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Colin, sounds like you had an interesting campaign.<br/><br/>I wanted to note though, that while Actual Play Experience is awesome, I'd also like to hear what you would like to see/do in a Mech RPG even if you haven't had the chance to do it.<br/><br/>I'm ultimately looking for inspiration and your input is greatly appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220313/#Comment_220313" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T10:31:22+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 10:31AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest you ask a different question, or take a different approach: Consider other genres or film, TV, or literature with which you are familiar that involved individual or squad-level combat, because there's little about mechs <i>per se</i> that makes a particular narrative wrapper more or less appropriate (aside from the mandatory suspension of disbelief, because mechs are inherently inefficient use of materiel).<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/>* Black Sheep Squadron - You're on station at a frontline base, but often get called into battles or fight off raids. The character interaction revolves around everything from romantic entanglements to dealing with prisoners to basic maintenance challenges with harried supply lines.<br/>* Shogun - The politics is the thing; the mechs only come out when all else fails and it's time to armor up and start slashing.<br/>* Battlestar Galactica - You are a remnant on the run, pursued by utterly hostile forces (70s) which MIGHT have more in common with you than you ever suspected (00s). Ship-board life, supply runs, shore leave on habitable planets--all the usual stuff a militarized culture does while playing the ultimate game of hide and seek. (You have to handwave a bit to deal with the "why do we fight with ground-based mechs, if were space-based?" I'd suggest a LOT of reasons for planet-fall, like fuel and water and food... and, yeah, "Why don't we grow our own food? Why can't we synthesize water from scooping off gas giants?" "STFU, man! We're doin' Mechs In Space, OK; deal!")<br/><br/>Main point being that mechs could be fighter planes, tanks, armored dudes, whatever--the RP will be about the people commanding, operating, supporting, or sheltered by these monstrosities of illogical military development. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220315/#Comment_220315" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T10:32:42+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 10:32AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot of different ways you can go depending on what pieces you take out of the genre bag. Mechwarrior and Battletech are fascinating to me because they firmly left the family drama and coming-of-age story materials in the bag and pretended nobody ever had blue hair. I kinda see them as documents from an alternate history where white wargamers came up with mecha instead of Japan. That's not necessarily a bad thing, or without its strengths - if you dig through Battletech you will find a fictional military history so detailed and thorough that your jaw will drop, and none of it is necessary to play, none of it comes into play through any means except a GM or scenario creator who goes "hey, what if THIS?"<br/><br/>Even Palladium's Robotech focused more on the machines than on the teens. It wasn't until Heartquest's <i>Steel Roses</i> supplement that anyone did anything with the interpersonal relationships that form the basis of much of the drama (and comedy) in the source material.<br/><br/>Okay, so to answer your question now.<br/><br/>Here's what I want:<br/><br/>- I want non-mech pilots to be viable character options, be they commanders, technicians, spies, whatever. These people must have mechanically interesting things to do while the mechs are fighting. Maybe a victory point system.<br/><br/>- I want relationships between the PCs and between PCs and NPCs to be a big part of the game. That might involve mechanics or it might involve some damn good advice and character creation work.<br/><br/>- I want scenarios designed to put pressure both on the machines and on the people. With Great Power accomplished this by identifying "strife Aspects", which were chosen by the players as most interesting, and those Aspects were targetted by the bad guys' plans. Something like that, although naturally war might put pressure on even without anyone's plans.<br/><br/>- I'd like to know up front whether this is Tom Clancy or Joseph Heller - is the military a well-oiled machine, or is it a hilarious collapsing mess?  Maybe both should be options. <br/><br/>Now I want to go design a Sergeant Bilko game for a mech setting.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oreso" title="oreso"><img alt="oreso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oreso">oreso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220323/#Comment_220323" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T10:43:48+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 10:43AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2009 11:06AM by oreso.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not really mecha, but I thought of doing a game with players as movie style Transformers.

(Although he did have a Heart of Gold (tm) which would make him try to set things right on behalf of those less fortunate or in the inevitable event of unintended consequences from whatever scam he was running at the time.) <br/><br/>Bilko: Finally I got a break, they held the division mech sparring championship at our post. It was a toss-up. Now, to me, that's just sloppy. I like a sporting event in which I know the outcome before-hand, its more organized. I find one of the young duellists and for a 50-50 split of all the winnings, he agrees to give less than a supreme effort in the squared circle.<br/><br/>Barbella: You paid him to take a dive.<br/><br/>Bilko: Of course. I had this corporal working for me, Leo Kletz. The night of the fight I give him the money to pay-off my pilot. Leo misunderstands and gives the money to the other guy.  This pilot is a little surprised but figures "what the heck, its a good price, I'll go down". Meanwhile my guy figures "oh, Bilko must have meant I get the money after I take the dive, no problem, I'll go down anyway."<br/><br/>Doberman: So both Mech pilots think they're taking a dive?<br/><br/>Bilko: Yep.<br/><br/>Barbella: What happened?<br/><br/>Bilko: History. For three rounds nobody hit anyone, it was a dance recital. Finally, I think out of boredom, one of them fired off a single missile.<br/><br/>(Shows holo of two mechs dancing around each other.

Metal Gear, as a series, is all about military espionage and such revolving around giant robots (which are basically a stand-in for the nuclear bomb).<br/><br/>So you could totally do that:  The game is about stealing mechs or plans for mechs from enemy states, keeping them from stealing yours, and the catastrophic consequences of their super-mechs if the enemy gets their hands on them.  Perhaps your PC group is a commando squad: <br/><br/>You pilot a group of mechs in the warzone, break past enemy lines, then get out of the mechs to raid the scientific facility where the plans are kept.  Inside the facility, you discover that the true story is more sinister and complicated than the simple plan first seemed, which eventually leads to more mech fight against someone else who tells you a dire secret witht heir dying breath once you defeat them, which leads to investigation into your superior back at base...

For an incredible price, they have agreed to fly their machine to the Space Witch's fortress, and battle his mecha-minions.<br/><br/>But all is not as it seems.

The character can make Boltron run, jump, fly (briefly), crouch, and also crush things beneath its feet.  The character relies one the head to provide information about the surroundings, and the arms for help with climbing.<br/><br/>Right Arm: This character is the only one who can use Boltron's main gun.  The gun can shoot anything in close range, and with the coopiration of the head, the gun can shoot things further away.  The gun gets a free d6 when shooting things.<br/><br/>Left Arm: This character is the only one who can pick things up, manipulate things, and perform detailed actions.  The arm can also punch things and throw things.<br/><br/>Head: This character is in charge of the Mighty Boltron's sensors and targeting, and also has a small pair of short-range lasers.  The head is able to scan far-away targets, communicate with other mechs, and detect energy emmissions.<br/><br/>You may need to add other roles.

Sure, the background material may provide a grandiose, galaxy-spanning setting, with lots of characters in high positions that seem to be more important than just a bunch of mech pilots, and political intrigue far beyond anything the pilots would normally be involved in... but we only play games, tell stories, about the people who are interesting to us. By choosing to play a game about mech pilots, we're saying that <i>these characters</i> are the ones who matter. Whether their story stays on the level of the personal everyday troubles and foibles of being mech pilots, or whether it expands to a level that affects affairs on the galactic stage, there is no "larger story" that could somehow "suffer" by focusing on these characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220929/#Comment_220929" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T08:18:22+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  8:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Philaros: <i>Bingo.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to shamelessly steal this explanation, and modify it for my purposes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221000/#Comment_221000" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T14:01:46+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  2:01PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feel free! and thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221238/#Comment_221238" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T17:17:10+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  5:17PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, seriously, Phil.

Some are jet fighters, some are a superhero's second skin, some are a barely-controlled alien creature, and so on.<br/><br/>BattleMechs are tanks with legs.<br/><br/>The latter are good for gritty military stories. The former can be <b>anything</b>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: philaros</cite>[...]there is no "larger story" that could somehow "suffer" by focusing on these characters.</blockquote>\nIn mecha anime especially, the scope of the story's setting is ultimately exactly the same as the scope of what the protagonists can affect. (There's some buildup of course.) However, looking at Gundam and Macross, which are probably the two most indispensable entries into the genre, it's not hard to set things up in such a way that the mecha pilots get embroiled in whatever's going on, whether it's a girl whose singing can turn the tide of the war, or political scheming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
