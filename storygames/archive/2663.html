We've all worked together, and we had lots of fun.<br/><br/>That said, the system is killing me - I consider myself a fairly well-versed d20 player, but the level of detail and mechanics they've piled on top of d20 is DAUNTING. Everyone was fine with me saying "Ok, we don't have time to do things their way, so how about we do this part this way..." and making something up. Everyone was helpful and contributing to eachothers' fun, so it all worked, but I just thought I'd ask anyone out there running it - how do you cope with the system complexity?  I feel like it'll take some seriously dedicated study to take it all in.<br/><br/>(cross-posted on rpg.net)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61190/#Comment_61190" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-15T09:25:07+00:00" title="March 15, 2007  9:25AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

The 'awesome stuff' that I've seen talked about:<br/><br/>- Dramatic Conflict cards - potential for much coolness; but like M:tG Cards, each is really introducing new rules that add mechanics. They'd be just as cool with just the titles that let you conceal your maneuver until both you and your opponent have decided maneuvers, then just incorporate both into the actions that get described that round.<br/><br/>- NPC creation system is streamlined from standard d20, and the chapter includes advice like 'start with a motivation' that shouldn't be news to anyone here. I didn't use this though, just made up stats for my mooks on the fly, by fiat.<br/><br/>- There's TONS of gear, and so for gear-oriented people that's Big Fun. For my players, it was overwhelming. The game has an 'intel phase' after a mission has been given but before its start, where there's intricate rules about picking gear for your characters based on 'Mission Caliber' and stuff like that. We did it by me laying out the mission and asking them "What do you want?" then saying Yes or No to their various requests (I think the only one I said no to was explosives).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61219/#Comment_61219" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-15T11:45:43+00:00" title="March 15, 2007 11:45AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I could play any d20 related game, it'd be Spycraft 2.0.
