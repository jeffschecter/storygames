I'm super excited about what I've put together, so let me run through the details.<br/><br/>What is it?<br/>ANIMAL CRIME follows the investigations of Marmot Detective as he is sucked once more into the grim underbelly of Animal City, where danger is around every corner, even the innocent have their secrets, and no one is above suspicion. His cases take him from dive bars and numbers rackets to the boardrooms and elite clubs of high society, and everywhere he goes he uncovers rot and decay.<br/><br/>Okay ... so what about the role-playing game?<br/>The ANIMAL CRIME roleplaying game lets you and your friends take on the roles of Marmot Detective and his list of suspects, as he tries to unravel yet another sordid crime. It takes about 45-90 to play, and comes complete in a boxed set, with board game style rules and play sheets. The goal is to have a game which you, as someone who enjoys role-playing games, can play with other friends in the social space of a board game.<br/><br/>The product I'm selling is a boxed set containing:<br/>1) A 16 page, three color comic, (ANIMAL CRIME presents MARMOT DETECTIVE in THE McCORGI AFFAIR), detailing one of Marmot Detectives most famous cases. Art by Jake Richmond, writing by me.<br/>2) Enough dice to play the game (six)<br/>3) Character pamphlets<br/>4) Pencils<br/>5) Game rules<br/>6) A secret gift<br/><br/><a href="http://www.animalcrime.com/?page_id=13" rel="nofollow">It is on sale now for $30 + $5 shipping</a> at the animalcrime.com store, and will soon be available on the <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/" rel="nofollow">TAO Games site</a> as well. International orders coming as soon as I can figure out what it costs to mail this thing internationally.<br/><br/>I have only made 100 copies of this game, and more than half have already been sold, so act soon if you want to make sure you'll get one.<br/><br/>But what if I don't want to buy something? What's in it for me?<br/>If you're not convinced, or don't have the money, that's fine. Today is also the launch of the <a href="http://animalcrime.com/" rel="nofollow">ANIMAL CRIME webcomic</a>. The introductory comic (ANIMAL CRIME presents MARMOT DETECTIVE in The McCorgi Affair) will run weekly (updates Monday/Tuesday 12AM) for the next several weeks, until it is finished. After that, we have ... well, let's just say we have plans. The comic is absolutely free and I would be thrilled if you could tell your friends and enemies about it<br/><br/>But what if I hate comics and only like role-playing games, and even then only ones that are free?<br/>You're in luck! A barebones version of the ANIMAL CRIME role-playing game will be available on the <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/" rel="nofollow">TAO Games site</a> within a week. Like all TAO Games, it will be available for free or for a suggested donation.<br/><br/>Aren't you just ripping off Sea Dracula?<br/>ANIMAL CRIME and Sea Dracula are closely related games. Jake (and, to a lesser degree, Nick) has been involved in the game since the very early stages, including providing the art for the project. We're hoping to do some even more closely related stuff in the future.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.animalcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/femme-fatale-smaller-e1329209376903.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359452/#Comment_359452" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T01:03:55+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  1:03AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2012 1:05AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First installment of the web comic looks great!<br/><br/>I am strongly reminded of the "Tracer Bullet" Calvin &amp; Hobbes stories.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>The goal is to have a game which you, as someone who enjoys role-playing games, can play with other friends in the social space of a board game.</blockquote>That's an exciting goal; I'm eager to see how it goes!

I can't imagine it would be a problem, except I'd say that the "facilitator" should probably take a Suspect role, rather than the Marmot Detective role. Marmot Detective's game chores are not really that hard for someone who knows what an RPG is, but the Suspects might go astray if they decide that it's their job to keep MD from solving the mystery.<br/><br/>Dave: I know of no AP reports. From personal experience, the game is just fine, easy for folks who aren't gamers to learn their part. But a large chunk of the social design here is in the presentation: it's a box, it has everything you need to play in it, etc. So that's actually wholly untested, because I'm just now packing boxes.<br/><br/>Hans: Yup!<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359656/#Comment_359656" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T16:54:07+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  4:54PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations!
