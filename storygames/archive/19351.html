I decided to try running through one of the past contests as practice and went right back to the start, to 2002. The ingredients were:<br/><br/>- Africa<br/>- Art<br/>- Court<br/>- Numerology<br/><br/>I had intended to run through this in the nine days while I was up in Iceland on holiday, but work interfered and I ended up working for most of it and a whole load of other work crap rained down when I got back. That meant the game has had to keep being bumped off of my priority list.<br/><br/>Combine that with my tendency to over research subjects and the game has taken far longer than the nine days, although admittedly, most of that is spread out around actual work and a lot of travel.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have work commitments and other gaming projects I\u2019ve promised people I\u2019ll complete so I\u2019m reluctantly conceding my game <i>Mother Sahra</i> done. It\u2019s not finished, but it\u2019s about 80% there. I at least managed to learn a lot about my own work patterns and the realistic amount of time I can devote to the contest (next to nothing).<br/><br/>I\u2019ll try to come back to this and finish it when I can, but for the moment, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yalqgxxnds640zz/Mother%20Sahra.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> it is in all its under-cooked glory.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430848/#Comment_430848" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-11T11:25:12+00:00" title="April 11, 2014 11:25AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having done many Game Chefs in the past, I can tell you that 80% complete is actually pretty good.  The real prize from Game Chef is having the first rough notes on something that you can expand on and revise and finish at a later date.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430965/#Comment_430965" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T13:07:42+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  1:07PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey man!<br/><br/>Good on your for attempting Game Chef. It's a tough thing to do, creating a full RPG in just a few weeks. I entered (and won) in 2011 with Forsooth!<br/><br/>I find that the most important thing I did to help Forsooth! succeed was to shy away from setting and use my time and book space to create an interesting rules system that reflects the themes. I see that your book is a ton of (good) theme, but then just a page and a half of mechanics! If you want to do well in Game Chef, you need a fully playable game. If you keep that in mind for next year, you'll be in great shape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
