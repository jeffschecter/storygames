(<a href="http://amzn.com/B002RKRTNM" rel="nofollow">Free on Kindle</a>, though for some reason Google Books doesn't have the free text.)<br/><br/>I have put together an idea for how to use FATE to do this from the Dresden Files implementation of FATE, especially the duration chart (fuck the haters).<br/><br/>Essentially, in FATE, you roll 4 FATE dice and generate a result from -4 to +4, with a very high chance that you'll get a result of -1, 0 or 1.  Then you add those dice to your skill, with a +2 for any applicable Aspects.<br/><br/>Dresden gives the idea of City Aspects, but only suggests changing the City Aspects at the conclusion of major sections of the game.  This is a good fit for Dresden, but if you want to do a politics game, you want the characters to have more clout than that, so that something's on the line.<br/><br/>When doing a politics game, you have to decide how politics actually works.  In other words, in thinking up a political system, you are yourself making a political statement, at least within the world of the fiction.  For example, in Vampire: the Requiem's Damnation City political action supplement, politics works through dominating or eliminating influential people.  Most people suffer the effects of political action (Vampires cheerfully work to eliminate police response in areas where they need to hunt) without having any impact whatsoever on it.<br/><br/>For this game, I wanted to try to be a bit more generic.  I wanted to be able to simulate a corrupt city or one that strives to accomplish things and moves forward, by adjusting the values and stunts available to the characters.<br/><br/>This could be used for any number of settings, from "West Wing In The Wild Cards Universe" to my current obsession, "Commissioner Gordon's 'The Wire'".<br/><br/>More soon!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379329/#Comment_379329" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T15:34:08+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  3:34PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's nice.

If you're "cleaning up the neighborhood", that's easier than reforming the whole educational system.  <br/><br/>The basic premise that I'm trying to put across in this version is "Big changes are harder to accomplish, and harder to reverse."<br/><br/>I don't want to quite use zones in the normal Dresden sense (I'm not that familiar with Diaspora), because politics is pretty much everywhere - it's more about your grasp than your reach, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>By the way, I highly recommend not calling what you're doing in the game "politics".  That word has gotten successfully poisoned.  Politics is awesome and great, in every way.

My Fate campaign - The Bastards - features a lot of intrigue, and I've been trying to give it some mechanical punch. A few things I've explored:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. A few skills - Court, Trade, and Underworld - that allow social attacks, maneuvers, and assessments.<br/>\n2. A map of social "zones" - circles - of the city, so depending on your social status, it may be difficult to attack someone in a different circle. <br/>\n3. Aspects can be placed on circles, such as "rumors of hoarding," or "rampant corruption." You can make a Court roll (for example) to change or place an Aspect - but NPCs might be opposing you. <br/>\n4. Characters have social stress tracks, which do NOT clear automatically each session - so you can attack someone's reputation overt time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been working really well, but it's still pretty ragged. It's a lot to track over time, and it can be hard to show all the aspects, zones, and characters in play at any one time when the entire city is at stake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379490/#Comment_379490" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T09:39:12+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  9:39AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As with Thaumaturgy, Politics is about collecting Clout.<br/><br/>How much Clout do you need?<br/><br/>Scope: What are you trying to change?

Four to ten years. +15<br/>"Since the Wayne murders." For as long as anyone can remember. +20<br/><br/>So you create a difficulty for the change - that's how much Clout you need to gather. <br/><br/>Next, opposition and what it means to win in this system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379546/#Comment_379546" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T13:27:06+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  1:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2012 1:32PM by creases.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love <i>The West Wing</i>. My god, you could make a whole mini-game about what Josh does, just on his own. Diaspora's social combat could work reasonably well for that, actually. Every House or Senate vote is a giant social combat, the map is divided into Yay, Nay, and Undecided zones for a given bill, members of Congress are pawns that fall in one or the other sector (presumably with Aspects based on party affiliation, and perhaps others as individual NPCs), there's a timer counting down, and then Josh has to find a way to wrangle them into the sector the President tells him to put them in. So he goes and has mini-social-combats with the ones he can sway --- debates them on principles, appeals to their loyalty, offers them pork or threatens to take something away, etc. There might be temporary Aspects to describe the current political climate, and maybe the moral and practical issues at stake in the vote could be Aspects as well. Not to mention that the President's Aspects would also be relevant, as well as Leo's, etc. Then Toby and Sam's mini-game is to put public opinion Aspects in play that Josh can also draw upon favorably, CJ's is to take bad Aspects out of play, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379569/#Comment_379569" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T15:27:55+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  3:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html#social-combat" rel="nofollow">Social Combat</a> in Disapora, well worth a look for idea mining.
