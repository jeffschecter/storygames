Often enough though, it is a dialog between player and GM about a sequence of actions (not in character - but made at a distance - a detached distance).<br/><br/>In ordinary live we don't get to make these meta-dialogs. Instead we act and see what feedback the world gives us. So RPG dialog and life are different. Also RPG dialog is detached even when we are speaking in the characters voice because we are not the character. When I speak to someone in ordinary life there is very much an emotional component that RPGs lack. <br/><br/>I wonder how many RPG designers are thinking about dialog skills? I bet a lot of Story Gamers are aware of them. I'm not certain other gamers are aware (even when using them). When people are aware they can get self conscious and that is uncomfortable for a lot of people. I hit this wall with Matrix games because I ask people to make things up. This puts them on the spot. I think people like reacting to events more than taking charge of events. So in RPGs the GM creates the world that the characters react to or the system sets them up to face conflict. Either way, the players may be pretty unaware that they are using dialog skills.<br/><br/>I'm a psychotherapist and dialog is what we do. When a person comes in they are stating a problem and that brings up the feelings. The therapist guides them through an experience (not fixing them but helping them learn how to try out new things on their own). In group therapy (Yolum is the big name) we try to get people to be aware of how they are reacting inside as people speak and to say it out loud. This provides unique feedback to people. People get to practice being open and taking things in. It is a rather unnerving process for many. They don't like the lack of rules of it all. They know they are suppose to talk but don't know what about. They are self conscious. It is all about emotion - which RPGs often are not.<br/><br/>I'm thinking I need more structure and rules input to player now rather than more freedom. I'm running into the Czege principle a lot lately.<br/><br/>Just some thoughts - now back to work!<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321514/#Comment_321514" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-22T10:48:03+00:00" title="April 22, 2011 10:48AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just like to hear your answers to those questions, Tomas.<br/>I'm not even really sure what a dialog technique is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321520/#Comment_321520" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-22T12:09:12+00:00" title="April 22, 2011 12:09PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>When you say "dialogue" do you meant "the words the character speak" or "the words the players at the table are speaking."<br/></blockquote>\nHow can we possible separate the two out?<br/><br/>We can see the difference of stances in the two - that seems easy - but on a "what people are doing at the table" behavior assessment they both involve players (GM and PC runner) talking - Dialog.<br/><br/>To muddy up the waters further - imagine a player who is very shy and who will not speak in their character's voice. (The emotional thing I was getting at). The player says "My character talks to the guard and tells him a joke." He then looks to the GM for a reaction. The player did not speak in the characters voice or tell a joke but the only difference between them actually doing it and talking about it is - well - very little. The GM (or the game system if this is handled mechanically) says how they react or maybe they speak in the guards voice. This is just too fluid to tell apart.<br/><br/>Or so it seems to me.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321534/#Comment_321534" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-22T13:47:47+00:00" title="April 22, 2011  1:47PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, have you played "Puppetland"?

Yes, it is nice. I like the way the designer give advice (rules, actually) on how to "tell the tale". It comes off as heavy handed now, so many years later (published 1999), but I imagine a lot of players will have some bulbs flashing up above their heads while playing Puppetland, or while reading it.<br/><br/>And I really enjoy the <i>Power Kill</i> game too, which is the opposite part of the Puppetland-book. Very smart to make the characters of our ordinary rpg into part of a schizophrenic psychosis, and then make a game based on us being interviewed by a counselor on our mental health, us answering as our out-of-the-world characters.

This is quite evident in some of my recent games; scenes feed into each other, more and more for every scene that is added, raising the nerve and acuity of the game as we progress, until we play out scenes as acute as real life, and as heartfelt and meaningful. <br/><br/>It has become clear to me recently, that every scene in a role-playing game is built on every scene that has been played out before in that same game. Every role-playing game ever created utilize this phenomenon, albeit unconsciously, mostly. But I have found that it is possible to design games that utilize it consciously, to strengthen the effect of the phenomenon.

If Thomas only meant "techniques for dialogue between characters" that'd be one thing. It would of course involve how the people speak to each other... but exclude all the other ways they talk to each other. But he means all of it, which means another--which includes how the characters discuss and interact. <br/><br/>I just needed to know which one he meant.<br/><br/><br/>And to all...<br/><br/>I have a strange question -- strange because it begs the question of how strange talking to each other during a roleplaying game really is:<br/><br/>Aren't roleplaying games just drawing on the oral traditions used to communicate story? That is: Theater and Oral Storytelling?<br/><br/>A story teller might say, telling a tale in the first person, "I walk over to the guard and told him a joke." That's it. The storyteller wouldn't have to act out the tale and illustrate it with in-the-moment, present tense performance to make the people understand the fiction. He'd just say, "I walk over to the guard and tell him a joke." The fact that Oral Storytelling is usually told in the past tense doesn't change any of this. <br/><br/>And as for theater, two or more characters talk to each other with limited sets or costume pieces -- the tale is told in the dialogue or actions between the characters happening right in front of us. Boom.

We make use of techniques very similar, in many respects.<br/><br/>And then the role-playing game <i>differ</i> too, in some very significant ways:<br/><br/>1 - It is alone to base its narrative on active input from its "audience". <br/><br/>2 - It is alone to make use of our skills, not as orators or actors, but as conversationalists. RPG's would be dead wood in our hands, without our tried and tested dialogue-skills.<br/><br/>3 - It is alone in having creators, designers, who are expressing themselves by turning their audience of amateurs into the main performing artists of the narrative. Artistically this is a very demanding and unique challenge.<br/><br/><b>Dialogue</b> is central in every part of this, in my view. So talking and thinking dialogue-techniques is one obvious way of broadening our range of designer-tools, and sharpening our designer-skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_321572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321572/#Comment_321572" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-23T02:06:10+00:00" title="April 23, 2011  2:06AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

My thoughts on this theme are new, and evolving as we speak. I could say more than I did in my last post, though. <br/><br/>I'm trying to unearth dialogue techniques by talking and thinking about what is going on around the table. The insights won this way, I make use of to design more effective games. Mostly by giving sound advice on how the players should act in key moments of the game. <br/><br/>A key moment in all games is how we <i>initiate</i> the dialogue. Kind of; how we set the oral premise for our interaction, and thus prepare the emotional field for the fiction we are about to create. I believe there are some key elements in this phase:<br/>- establishing <b>trust</b> amongst the players<br/>- kicking off the interaction; facilitating constructive group <b>dynamics</b><br/>- strengthening the <b>emotional field</b>, through conscious use of words, tone and voice-levels<br/><br/>I try to make advice hands on, and simple. <br/>- Like: <i>All of you sit close and talk softly. Use a small table, or no table at all.</i> <br/>- Or: <i>Sit against each other, on opposite sides of the table. Talk softly to those on your side, and talk loudly to the other side.</i><br/>- Or: <i>One of you will be the one all others are pecking on. The one in this role should be required to raise his voice, and to say things twice each time, to be heard, whatever scene you are in and whatever he says. You may do as he says, but not without taking a verbal peck at him.</i><br/><br/>The thing is to forecast what such instructions will do to the interaction, how it will influence the dialogue and feed into the theme. As you may imagine, instructions like these feed into the emotional field of a game-theme quite easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321629/#Comment_321629" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-24T02:22:42+00:00" title="April 24, 2011  2:22AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'play unsafe' has a few things to say about how to act out status.<br/><br/>So your dialog techniques are how to talk, not what to say?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_321636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321636/#Comment_321636" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-24T06:20:53+00:00" title="April 24, 2011  6:20AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2011 6:25AM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes. <br/><br/><i>What</i> to say is best left to the players. As designers we build methods for players to use, and giving advice on <i>how to talk</i> is of great use. Much of what we say communicate emotion as much as reason, and often in the way we say it. So we may support the game-theme by giving advice on how to use voice in relation to it. The dialogue-skill of the players is the base of the game, while the game-method is some kind of ritual. Rituals often depends on certain ways of using voice (singing, shouting, rhythmic talking, etc), to facilitate particular emotional responses. This is absolutely interesting to make use of in relation to role-playing games.<br/><br/><i>Mind you: I do not mean "ritual" in the mystic and esoteric meaning of the word, but as in: "a string of interactions and orations, set within a formal framework" (sorry for sounding a bit dry here).</i><br/><br/><i>Play unsafe</i> is one of the most interesting and insightful codices on role-playing games I've seen.

They can catch in our ear--and these are the things we can build on as the tale accumulates by adding one detail after another.

And knowing the situation, you should (or at least, someone at the table should) be able to figure out how any given character feels about that situation, how it affects their goals, and what they want other people to do about it.  From there, you've got the material for dialogue, because good dialogue scenes should be about two or more people who want something from each other, and what they'll try to do to get it.<br/><br/>This is one reason why scenes where one person just recites exposition at another person are usually so frickin' dull: there's often no agenda beyond just delivering information, which is not good material for a dramatic, interesting dialogue.  Sometimes exposition is a necessary evil, but if you can ever find a way to tie it back into character desires and motivations -- to make it less about "here is the information you requested" and more about "here is what I, the character, want you, the other character, to know about this...because by telling you this information in this way, I am hoping to get something from you" -- you should probably go for it.<br/><br/><br/>I think it's actually trickier when you know the participants of the dialogue but don't know what the situation around them is: it makes for fun "empty" dialogue, basically just in-character banter, but it doesn't really move the game in any particular direction.  It's dialogue for pure entertainment, which I'm actually quite fond of, but I think is probably not what you wanted this thread to be about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321690/#Comment_321690" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T06:19:58+00:00" title="April 25, 2011  6:19AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say the speed issue depends on the system.

We humans are.basically, very much alike. We respond in the same way to a lot of things. So we have a basis of understanding when talking to each other, and while designing games for each other.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>...good dialogue scenes should be about two or more people who want something from each other, and what they'll try to do to get it.</blockquote>Hmm ... should they? All of them? <br/><br/>No room for other kinds of dialogue? Dialogues out of the narrow we-compete-for-dominance box? What about a dialogue where people get something they don't want? Like: a man not really wanting to tell his wife she's a nagging bitch, and then we play what he'll do to bring himself in a situation where he tells her that, to her face! And we play how he face the consequences!<br/><br/>None of them actually tried to get what they really wanted, probably, but it may still be a devilishly good dialogue scene ...<br/><br/>It is easy to do, if you let the dialogue bring you there. I feel that there is much more to be had from leaving the conflict-focus behind, and developing a broader view on what kind of themes may be played out in out games. And this kind of game-play is easily achieved by "going dialogal". ;-)<br/><br/>Role-playing games has created lopsided dramas, and they still do, generally speaking, due to them being ridden by a <i>mechanical</i> focus that feeds into conflict management. It is, to me at last, a very old dilemma; even though we may want it, other kinds of dramatic content is difficult to manage in such games, due to the method being dominated by the mechanics. So when we tried it, it fell flat. No conflict; no joy!<br/><br/>The dialogue has been treated as the ugly duckling, and has been left to fend for itself. But applying some simple techniques to the dialogue, opens up the interaction for a greater variety of themes. In my view working with dialogue techniques should be treated as a fully viable design-aveny for a modern rpg-designer. Role-playing games as a form of art actually <i>need</i> designs more lopsided towards dialogue techniques from now on, to make up for the skewed state of things in the field. We need to educate ourselves on this important aspect of the games we design and play.<br/><br/>Even the conflicts gets to be more interesting, when you play them out with more of the inherent dynamics of a dialogue intact. In my experience the use of conscious dialogue techniques supports more unpredictable and smoother dramatic movements, and a richer weave of both conflict <i>and</i> non-conflict stuff to develop. That is the reason I keep on designing in this field, and keep talking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321715/#Comment_321715" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T10:11:50+00:00" title="April 25, 2011 10:11AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like what you're calling dialog techniques are what I think of as 'people skills' - or ways to formalize people skills - the sort of things that you might have to work at, at first, and then come naturally / fade into the background ...<br/><br/>A couple techniques for good listening are:<br/>- asking sincere, interested questions (I have a game called 'Pass-Around Storytelling' which has the rule 'Don't Question' which I think is a bad rule - I get where they're coming from, some people can wield questions like a club, but...)<br/>- saying what they said back to them                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_321719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321719/#Comment_321719" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T11:06:27+00:00" title="April 25, 2011 11:06AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Sounds like what you're calling dialog techniques are what I think of as 'people skills' - or ways to formalize people skills - the sort of things that you might have to work at, at first, and then come naturally / fade into the background ...</blockquote>Yes it is, and it does.<br/><br/>Point is to use them to make better games, and games of another kind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321756/#Comment_321756" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T15:40:40+00:00" title="April 25, 2011  3:40PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2011 3:41PM by stefoid.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- How do you give goals to a dialogue, when you don't even know the participants?</blockquote>\nIf you don't know the participants, you should at least know the situation.
