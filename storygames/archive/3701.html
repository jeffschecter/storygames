But there are plenty of games that go in other directions, and certainly room for even more. I think The Princess Game is a great example of a storytelling game that is tons of fun but doesn't take itself to seriously. <br/><br/>But actually Graham, after re-reading your post I'm not really sure what you want.

Breaking the Ice under the cold glare of a Sorcerer-King in Dark Sun.<br/><br/>My Quintissential PTA game that I run (have run twice, try to shoehorn people into it at cons) is Star Trek Badasses, based entirely off of a story from Rafael Chandler.

Vulcan mob bosses, Klingon assassins, Ferengi captains. <br/><br/>I'd probably run Death's Door as is the first time. Have one of those emotional games where people weep and shake.

In an effort to improve on old tried and true concepts, they take on a deconstructive, academic approach. Instead of saying:<br/><br/>"This is the story of a farmboy who grows up to lead a nation to victory against an evil from beyond the stars, here's how you play a farmboy just like that"<br/>they say<br/>"This is a classic example of a Hero's Journey monomyth with the following 5 (or 8) archetypal acts. These are the rules to lead you through those acts in a way that optimize the thematic aspects of each one"<br/><br/>And if they don't say the latter in the game text proper, they certainly do on Internet forums when they discuss their game. What I'm not sure about is whether high-exposure WotC or WW games receive the same academic treatment behind closed doors or not.<br/><br/>In general, I think this is great. The irony, of course, is that while the latter approach will certainly ensure that the game is kept tight and focused around what makes the story what it should be, it can also make the story creation process - "play" - very mechanical. I think the "indie" game movement (if there is such a thing) need to avoid constructing Sacred Cows and judging those who slaughter them. If someone uses Dogs in the Vineyard to play a party of paladins delving into dungeons and recovering holy artifacts - and <i>have fun doing it</i> - there is little need to lecture them on the moral ambiguity lessons inherent in the application of town creation rules yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the much-despised "Rule 0", but mostly because it is often presented as an excuse for producing a clumsy and disjointed rule set by placing the editing responsibility on the players. I like my games simple, elegant, and internally consistent - and if a game reaches that point there is no need to stress "Rule 0". Having said that, it still boils down to player satisfaction, and many players aren't interested in the deep philosophical reasons why odd dice faces means that the Divine Authority receives narration rights that infringe on your Soul Essence's creative agenda.

What I meant was more about their (perceived) design ethic: That FUN, whatever kind of fun is aimed for, is worth working very, very hard for. That it isn't enough to just shake a few rules out of your sleeves and fudge the rest, but that FUN deserves well-thought mechanics, playtesting and just plain old HARD WORK from the designer. <br/><br/>That even a wacky let's-play-psychotic-right-wing-hamsters-infiltrating-gay-right-groups rpg* deserves to be taken seriously by their designer. Because they strive to make a good product.<br/><br/>(And just to make sure: I'm really not trying to say that the same doesn't go for many "mainstream" designers or anything. It's just an attitude I've, personally, always felt more strongly in the Indie community, but that could just as well be just me seeing things.)<br/><br/>*Not that I'm aware of such a game.

I don't mean to say that "indie" game designers are killjoys, but frankly, I <i>want</i> designers to pay more attention to the rules that are driving my stories than "Roll under Strength on a d20 to see if you can break stuff". I <i>want</i> them to take an academic approach. I <i>want</i> there to be unforeseen side effects to meddling with the system, because I <i>want</i> the game design to be tight and streamlined.<br/><br/>It's just that, sometimes, I get the impression that this thinking is visible between the lines in actual game texts. The next time this happens I will be sure to post a better example, but for now, consider the many passages in <i>Sorcerer</i> that justify various game design decisions, or in <i>Donjon</i> where the "game currency" (1 success = 1 fact = 1 die etc) is mentioned. As a GM, I have nothing against these passages, and as a player interested in game design, I am fine with them as well, but I imagine that many gamers would wonder why such parts are necessary. Just tell me what to roll!<br/><br/>Compare Magic: the Gathering rules. They tell you what you can do and how, and define victory conditions. They don't discuss how a Green Sapling Dryad deck is purposely disadvantaged against a red Lightning Bolt deck, and what steps you may take to rectify this - although this is what they really need to do in order to teach expertise in the system. Those that are interested in being experts in the system will have to learn this themselves. Personally, I would like to be an expert at any game I run for my players, because I don't want to fumble their game experience because of my stumbles, so I want my book to tell me this. My players, on the other hand, just want to know what they can do and how. Some GMs I know would be turned off by this, as well - they figure their intuitive idea of how the game should run is more important than how the game designer intended it to be run. If you're only going to release one book for all these crowds, you will have to carefully balance the language between them, or clearly separate sections (as, for example, Sorcerer does).<br/><br/>With Rich's post, he's cleared up any confusion on my part as to what Graham meant (exactly what he said, duh) so if anyone would like to comment on this further please feel free to do so in a new thread KTHXBYE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83223/#Comment_83223" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T10:57:49+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:57AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>I'm not saying that people shouldn't write games like that, just that I'd be happier (because I'd have more games I <i>am</i> interested in) if they didn't.</blockquote>I'm ... skeptical of this point.<br/><br/>Yes, I agree that <i>in theory</i> someone could be on the cusp of writing either a heart-breaking investigation of dark themes <b>or</b> a light-hearted romp of silliness, and they could choose to do one rather than the other, and then you're talking about zero-sum game:  If you get more serious, dark stuff then you get less light, frothy stuff.<br/><br/>But I think that, in practice, they are two different kinds of awesome, both of which people like, and that you cannot <i>increase</i> one by <i>reducing</i> the other.

WHEN YOU WILL GET SERIUS?<br/><br/>I was used to real grim, gritty roleplaying. Serius stuff. Nobody laughet in my old DM's "dungeons of death", where the most a character survived was third level. Oh, no, that was a "serius" game for serius people. You fight hard, and if made a mistake, everybody looked at you like you were a worm. <br/><br/>I see people game like this every years at the mainstream role-playing games. Real hardcore. No like these frilly little games about love and puppies, there.<br/><br/>What about the other big success? what is the ray of sunshine after D&amp;D? Duh, Vampire! Darkness, darkness, evel will win, trcnocracy no hope!<br/><br/>And then Kult, Godlike, Unknown Armies, Tribe 8... don't let me start talking about tribe 8. THAT is a serius game!!<br/><br/>People, accept reality. You'll never be "mainstream" until you stop making games where people play laughing or talking out-of-character. It's not SERIUS. It's not true role-playing.<br/><br/>I mean... even Sorcerer, that has a little glint of drama, lose it when you see that you can't force a dramatic conclusion on the players. When you see that the players can turn the game into humorism and the GM can't sip them. <br/><br/>Really. Get serius.

My next game was serious; <b>Bone White, Blood Red,</b> a story game of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. (But I also play it somewhat silly; I still owe an AP report about a talking, stalking coyote trying to hump the leg of my wife's character.)<br/><br/>The next game after that was even MORE serious; <b>Descanso Highway</b> is a rather grim game about death that uses cutesy scrapbooking to tell games.<br/><br/>My current game setting for D&amp;D, <b>Driftworld</b>, is not serious; it's flying airships and floating hunks of rock miles wide over an infinite ocean.<br/><br/>The next game I'll work on will either be an unnamed furry RPG (partially serious, partially absurd, partially just plain fun -- like furry fandom itself), or another scrapbooking game with the working title of <b>Frustrated Soccermoms.</b><br/><br/>Honestly? I think that the seriousness level of each game reflects more about what I'm going through at the time than whether I'm thinking about what might sell, or even what Graham might like to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83391/#Comment_83391" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T21:28:55+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  9:28PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hei, T-Boy!

Spirit of the Century produces the archetypal pulpy action adventure. Sorcerer produces the archetypal Faust story. Dogs in the Vineyard produces the archetypal gunslinging Wild West mormons sent by God story (sorry, couldn't fit it into a tighter genre than that, which is a compliment). InSpectres, I've heard mentioned, is more Ghostbusters than Ghostbusters - and similarly, Burning Wheel is more LotR than the LotR RPG is.<br/><br/>While Vampire can be used to tell any kind of story as long as it has vampires, and some degree of struggle regarding "Woe, I art a monstere". D&amp;D can tell any story as long as there's considerable room for killing things and taking its stuff. GURPS can tell any story period, as long as you're prepared to invest that amount of money in the copy paper and toner required to print a character sheet (slight exagerration).<br/><br/>Could it be that we - defined as "people who like Story Games" - are considered snobs, because of misperceptions with regards to the kind of stories the games tell?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Twyla" title="Twyla"><img alt="Twyla" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Twyla">Twyla</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83457/#Comment_83457" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T10:50:33+00:00" title="July 26, 2007 10:50AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>The most serious games I have ever played, MLwM and PTA: Hound and Hare, both rife with abuse and issues and shit each had moments of humor and light-heartedness and it wasn't out of character for what was going on or goofiness for goof's sake but a kind of release valve.</blockquote>\nThis game has been held up as "the" game of all games by my husband.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Twyla" title="Twyla"><img alt="Twyla" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Twyla">Twyla</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83458/#Comment_83458" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T11:03:13+00:00" title="July 26, 2007 11:03AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite><br/>Could it be that we - defined as "people who like Story Games" - are considered snobs, because of misperceptions with regards to the kind of stories the games tell?</blockquote>\nAs a complete newbie, other than having heard my husband talk about lots of these games, I looked at the guide for DexCon and cried, "Help!"... a which point he just signed me up for what he thought I'd like (and he wasn't wrong once!).

This is not to be confused with how gonzo the game<i>can be</i>played. 0 is dead serious, no humor and/or, no weirdness. 10 is all weirdness, all light, all the time. We will now begin assigning games particular gonzometer scores!</blockquote>\nWhat does a 5.5 mean?  No preference or a preference for half weird and half serious?<br/><br/>Plus, how do you judge game intent on this?  For example, there have been several discussions over whether or not the rules of Capes inherently push you to be silly.  Some people say the rewards for attention-getting behavoir force the game to be silly at equilibrium.  Others (like me) believe that players choose to be silly and that the rules are neutral on the subject.  (As an aside, this topic originally made me laugh to think back on those discussions.  Sometimes it seems like game designers can't win for losing.  Too serious!  Too silly!  To seriously silly!...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83509/#Comment_83509" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T13:47:57+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  1:47PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is that pronounced Gonz-O-meeter, or Gonz-ometer. <br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly I find that in Universalis, which is pretty damn agnostic on content, usually ends up with people starting at about the 7.5 rating for their first play of the game.
