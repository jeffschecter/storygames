They picked that game because it shows signs of "things I'd like to be associated with", or "things I could be and do in the context of play".<br/><br/>I don't care about the game you made; in and of itself.  I care about <b>me</b>.  And your game might, or might not, slot into the story I tell myself about my life and my identity. <br/><br/>I might buy an indie games for the indie-ness, this week.  I might avoid doing so next week.  I might buy it because you wrote it, or avoid it for the same reason.  This is true of any identifier you care to slap on a game.  Complaining about either one means you don't understand, bone deep, that even when I'm buying a game because you wrote it, I'm not buying it for you; I'm buying it because in the story I tell myself about who I am, I buy games from cool people that I like.  In this, I am an entirely normal consumer.<br/><br/>Follow me so far?<br/><br/>Okay. <br/><br/><b>If this is true, then what else is true?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267660/#Comment_267660" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-18T12:48:08+00:00" title="April 18, 2010 12:48PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Know thyself !<br/>\n<br/>\nBut know one does cus were all window shopping or consuming and shelving ?

It is not telling the pretty girls that they should want you, but rather you telling yourself that you should try to be what the pretty girls would want.  (Mind you, who the pretty girls actually are and what they are supposed to want is so warped by other marketing at this point that it may very well end up being the same thing in the end.)<br/><br/>"I want you to read my free book" and "I want people to believe in Jesus" is about other people.  You want other people to change who they are and what they do, not to change yourself.<br/><br/><br/>I can sort of see the argument for marketing being inherently corrosive, or at least coercive: marketing does not seek to educate or inform, it seeks to influence.  It's the difference between making a decision and being told what decision to make, and when one side exclusively profits from that decision, it's morally iffy territory at best.

Good marketing might inform, or it might be a total content-void.  <br/><br/>Hello Kitty is a total void - and deliberately!  Hello Kitty has no adventures, no stories, no content.

I see a difference between me telling you information that you may or may not benefit from but which doesn't directly benefit me either, and me telling you the same information precisely because I know that it benefits me directly when you agree with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267698/#Comment_267698" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-18T18:35:49+00:00" title="April 18, 2010  6:35PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2010 6:36PM by jenskot.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>In my mind, it comes from the fact that marketers do not work for the consumers.

More often now companies are looking to buy the right product idea to sell rather than create groups of people to buy existing products. <br/><br/>But I totally understand where you are coming from. A lot of marketers try to create groups of people to sell stuff to. Maybe even most\u2026 and most of them fail! Creating a need to sell something is disturbing! <br/><br/>Successful marketers flip the funnel.

Please note, I\u2019m not a psychologist or a neuroscientist. I just have friends who are and love to read books they recommend me. And although the theories below are used by many psychiatrists, they are not accepted by all researchers in comparative, evolutionary neuroanatomy.<br/><br/>The triune brain theory says there are three distinct layers in the brain. Each layer dominates different brain functions. <br/><br/>The R-complex (reptilian brain) is responsible for physical survival and maintenance. It takes over in fight-or-flight situations and is responsible for establishing reproduction and social dominance. It\u2019s obsessive, compulsive, rigid, and automatic. It\u2019s not capable of change and will repeat behaviors over ad over, never learning from its mistakes.  <br/><br/>The Limbic system is responsible for emotion, attention, and emotionally charged memories. It\u2019s critical for creating links between emotions and events, and plays a dominant role in storing and recalling memories. It drives our value judgments, deciding if we like something, and dominates behaviors that involve avoidance of pain, compulsive seeking pleasure repeatedly, and determines the amount of attention we give something. <br/><br/>The Neocortex is responsible for voluntary movement, processing sensory info, logical thinking, and abstract thought. <br/><br/>The take away point here is that although the Limbic system can override the R-complex\u2019s habitual and unchanging responses\u2026 the Neocortex is often reduced to simply rationalizing the Limbic system\u2019s value judgments. Hence people buy on emotion and justify with logic. So marketing often focuses on our emotions, our avoidance of pain, our desire for pleasure, and our emotionally charged memories (which is why nostalgia is so potent)\u2026 all controlled by the Limbic system. <br/><br/>Not all marketing is bad or evil. As I mentioned in a previous post, a lot of effective marketing is very useful to customers and doesn't lie. But there are issues above that if not handled carefully, make me uncomfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267706/#Comment_267706" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-18T19:28:37+00:00" title="April 18, 2010  7:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>D&amp;D4 I bought because WotC are lying bastards who tell lies.</blockquote>\nCan you put the Lie into the context of the thread so far?<br/><br/>As in, phrased as "You thought you were expressing, or getting ready to express, some thing in a certain way.

You have this image of what this [game] represents. It's also a short-cut to identifying other people that you're more likely to have something in common with. Now, you might have to do some filtering to figure out if the person is a poser or _really_ in step with you... but them having this thing [game] is an excellent first step.<br/><br/>It can also help mark you either as "one of the in-crowd" yourself (because you've joined an already established identity) or it can mark you as Someone To Watch, because you've taken a step out there and made a statement and other people have joined in that statement/identity.<br/><br/>Hello Kitty brings up a point though. With that form of branding and identification, you have a variety of socially acceptable ways of announcing your identity and making a statement. The statement itself might not be acceptable but you can "tune" the amount of statement. A full Hello Kitty backpack versus a Hello Kitty zipper charm. A Hello Kitty Notebook versus some stickers. A Hello Kitty ring versus a Hello Kitty shirt.<br/><br/>When you buy this [game], you have to work harder to make a statement. You have to show up online and talk about it, or you have to make sure you drag this [game] to some other event [other game?] and be noticed interacting with your new statement. The hope being that you'll elicit a response and be able to boldly make your statement to an audience. In theory this audience is going to be at least somewhat receptive, as _you_ are already there and since _you_ have acquired this [game] and _you_ aren't lame, your audience shouldn't be (too) lame either.<br/><br/>Basically, marketing is showing how this [game] will confirm that the story you tell yourself about yourself is a) true and b) something that others will desire to share with you. At least I think that previous statement might be theoretically correct, but I'm not 100% certain. <br/><br/>On a longer term scale, consistent participation in the consumerism will (hopefully) lead to a gain in status and respect. People will being to recognize you as an individual and even if they happen to have different [wrong?] tastes from yourself you've still established yourself as someone that's worthy of consideration. Especially in an online venue where even if one poster happens to recognize another's name it still feels like writing a message in a bottle and tossing it out into the electronic sea, breaking through that wall and being recognized is sweet sweet candy.<br/><br/>However, a danger occurs in that if you have too many people that make the purchase and make the statement, but don't actually _live_ the statement [play the game] you build a house of cards in which lives an emperor with his New Clothes. Design is then less about the result [game] and more about the appearance of the result.<br/><br/>Bodybuilders that get abdominal and calf implants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/clash" title="clash"><img alt="clash" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/clash">clash</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267777/#Comment_267777" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T08:11:39+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  8:11AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "If this is true, then what else is true?"<br/>\n<br/>\n* I know nothing about marketing<br/>\n<br/>\n* I only design games for myself<br/>\n<br/>\n* Levi is a smart guy whose brain works in quirky ways<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these are demonstrably true, and follow logically from your statement. :D<br/>\n<br/>\n-clash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267804/#Comment_267804" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T10:10:06+00:00" title="April 19, 2010 10:10AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Scurvy_Platypus</cite>Usually I just lurk around here, but I'll try a thought out...</blockquote>\nGame purchase as declared social positioning (rather than internal narrative)?

The only other guaranteed member of that community is the author (sort of; 'guaranteed' is a bit too strong here, but let it pass.)<br/><br/>It implies that in a general sense you (and everyone) is selling <i>identify modification</i> (or, alright; it could be <i>identify reinforcement</i> too).  That presupposes some degree of <i>identity failure</i> for which your product, at least theoretically, is the remedy.

Which is why, even though I don\u2019t consider marketing to be evil, there are ethical issues to consider when people use emotions to market. <br/><br/>The idea that selling based on logic isn't as effective as selling to our emotions bothers me personally. I try to be data driven. And I've spent a lot of time helping people understand why they make decisions so they can edit out destructive behaviors. <br/><br/>But emotions do have value. I don't feel ripped off when I watch a movie. It's obviously not real but I get a lot out of it. But it's also clear I'm buying an emotional experience when I go to the movies. <br/><br/>Selling on emotion isn\u2019t automatically bad. But plenty of products are sold on emotion disguised as logic. Or even worse, flat out lie. Which is unethical. But marketing that sells on emotions driven by lies is failing more and more. Honesty and transparency is winning out in a world where we have freer access to real time information. I\u2019m excited!<br/><br/>I haven\u2019t worked in marketing for a while and when I did it was mainly in creative, design, communication, user testing, and analytics. But even then I used to turn clients down constantly because I didn\u2019t believe in their products or the methods they wanted to use to sell them. Not only didn\u2019t I agree with them ethically, but their tactics often fail in the long term! Fortunately there is more data available to convince clients there are better and more ethical ways to approach marketing. It\u2019s not only ethical but it\u2019s also more effective.  <br/><br/>That all said, this isn\u2019t the total of what marketing is, just one part. And I agree with many people in this thread, many things in life aren\u2019t inherently bad. It\u2019s how they are used that makes them bad. <br/><br/>But even still\u2026 I agree that skepticism is a good thing. Not just about marketing but anything. Double check your facts. Listen to different perspectives. Be informed. None of what I\u2019m saying undermines that. And I don\u2019t think anyone is promoting blind trust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267963/#Comment_267963" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T14:07:56+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  2:07PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Jason, it's now clear to me that you <i>are</i> using the word "marketing" in a very narrow, very specific way.

Something closer to "gap between reality and perfection" is what I'm getting at.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to suggest is that customers are people who are somehow dissatisfied with some aspect of their reality.  If someone is perfectly happy with their OD&amp;D game, it doesn't make any sense trying to market a replacement to them -- yet I see people making that sort of mistake all the time.<br/><br/>Secondly, I was (and am) playing pretty fast and loose with what I mean by <i>identity</i> here.  I mean, in the most inclusive sense, both sides of the coin -- internal self-image, and external social image.  I think every product has an impact on both, although individual people might care more or less about one or the other.<br/><br/><br/>To get to the specific point of "When I sell you a game, I submit that I am selling you a means to express specific parts of who you are, in a specific and shaped context"... I feel a disagreement of opinions coming on.<br/><br/>I think lots and lots of people essentially agree with you.  But I don't agree with you, or any of them, either.  This isn't some semantic difference either -- this is about as basic and fundamental as it gets.  I'm not going to try to sway you here, but I just want to explain myself.<br/><br/>In my opinion, these sorts of games are a means to express specific parts of who you are <i>pretending to be</i>, in a specific context.  It's an extraordinarily classic case of Baudrillardian simulation.  So yeah, that's my opinion on the matter, for the record.<br/><br/><br/>Back to the general case: there's always the danger (and/or opportunity) of selling someone something you had absolutely no intention of.  I'm looking at the ironic hipster over there buying a NASCAR hat.  In theory this is possible in the RPG space, but I'm not sure I've ever seen it in the wild.  A game like Twilight 2000, with its peculiarly-80s fetishism of nuclear holocaust, seems ripe for it, along with many others.  Maybe the right confluence of factors hasn't quite been reached yet, or maybe I just missed it.<br/><br/>(Edit:  I just thought of/recalled Hackmaster.  I think that might be a reverse case, though -- a product trying to be all hip and ironic, but most of the consumers are playing it entirely straight.

Our actions define us, and buying is one way in which we define who we are (alongside eating, and dancing, and talking, and thinking).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is royally WTF, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is reasonable and calming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267992/#Comment_267992" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T19:07:04+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  7:07PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://images.icanhascheezburger.com/completestore/2009/1/27/128775785427184505.jpg"/><br/><br/>But, uh, seriously...<br/><br/>It strikes me that there are two ways (at least) to look at a "this thing/force/concept is EVERYwhere, in everything you do!" sort of theory. You can, as JD does, take the stance that it's meaningless: if marketing is everything, then marketing is nothing! Or you can take the stance that it's meaningFUL because it informs everything in your life.<br/><br/>I've certainly been on both sides of that divide with regard to this or that "it's in EVERYTHING!" theory. It's the sort of thing that's hard to prove OR disprove, 'cause of interpretive bias. "Oh Karl, you thing <i>everything</i> is a class struggle!" to which Mr. Marx replies, "yes, exactly!" and around and around you go. So the way off the carousel is to look at each one for the value you can derive from it--what's its interpretive power, what sort of sharpening or widening perspective does it provide?<br/><br/>So for ME, the idea that marketing is in every endeavor means that every layer can inform every other. If "I want you to hang out with me, your friend, tonight" is on some level the same as "I want you to purchase the entertainment product written by me, a stranger on the internet," then I can look at what sorts of things work for convincing you of the former, and how they can help me convince you of the latter--or vice versa. The fact that marketing is all these things besides hiring an ad firm to sell a commercial product means that we can study this thing as <i>just plain human interaction</i>, and that's a strength, not a weakness.<br/><br/>I'm excited to explore that territory. I want to learn more about getting people to: buy my entertainment products, read my blog, spend time with me socially, collaborate with me in creative endeavors, and so on and so on and so on.<br/><br/>In fact? That's it right there. As soon as you start looking at all these things--all of them!--as creative collaboration, it becomes a thing of joy for me.<br/><br/>Also a thing of joy for me is <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">story I tell myself (and others) about my life</a>*--therefore, Levi's formulation rings true for me and has value. I'm not sure if I have any value to return besides "hell yeah!" I'll think more about the "what else is true?" question.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>*Bam!

And how's that working out for us?<br/>Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse...  it's been a while since I read that stuff.  <br/>But one of those guys talks about the Alienation that arises when people seek self-affirmation from consumer products.<br/><br/>Kurt Vonnegut said it best:<br/><br/><b>"Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops."</b><br/><br/>The job of marketing is to help her shop.    But it's like that court case where a woman was raped in a Wal-mart parking lot and the 'security' didn't help her, because their job is protecting the merchandise:   the help marketing offers is often dwarfed by overwhelming culpability.<br/><br/><br/><b> What do I say about *myself* if I buy, and play, your game?</b><br/><br/>My early years of rpgs (1981-89) were mostly rpg hobby,<br/>with little intersection with rpg business or rpg marketing.    <br/><br/>My rulebooks were photocopied from friends, or purchased in dollar bins, etc.   I didn't attend cons.<br/>I was outside any sane business plan or marketing model. (Except Car Wars.  If federal agents hadn't raided Steve Jackson, our marketing-based relationship might have flourished.)  The point is: with scant help from 'marketing' I found games and they found me.<br/> <br/>When such <span style="color: #666633;">aggressive</span> marketing attempts as DragonLance and 2nd Ed. AD&amp;D were forcefed to the public; I was viscerally repulsed.  Thanks, marketing!  Thanks for all the shit!  <br/>A decade later, I knew to avoid White Wolf and Kollectible Kard Krazes, too, in spite of (or thanks to) marketing.<br/><br/>I resumed play in 2004, using a friend's old 1st ed. AD&amp;D books.  No new purchases.<br/>I first found this story games community via <a href="http://ptgptb.org/issue-index.html#thematic" rel="nofollow">ptgptb.org</a>, which was part of the rpg hobby, but outside the rpg business or rpg marketing.<br/><br/>That led me to the Forge, which felt like hobby not marketing.  At first, that is.<br/><br/>My first face-to-face contact was GenCon 2005, where the Forge boothmonkeys definitely were marketing at me.  I was eager to finally have genuine human interactions, but what I got was "DO YOU LIKE TV?!!!!!!", with giddy Scientology enthusiasm and PTA shoved in my face.  (Now that I think about it, was that you in 2005 Joshua?-- in a devilish costume, acting like an attention-starved jackanape?  Was that 'marketing'?  The funny part is, I'd have found the same attire and geekery endearing, if it wasn't connected to a sales pitch.)<br/><br/>How does marketing's track record look, long term, in this hobby?<br/>What was gained and what was lost, when Gygax marketed Arneson's fun into a 'product'?<br/>Or when the grognards' culture of correspondence and trading-ideas was repackaged and then usurped by Dragon Magazine,  as an 'official' for-sale trademarked business-product?<br/><br/>Starting to see why marketing might have a bad name in this hobby?<br/><br/> <br/>Let's pause for a breather, and I'll chuck a link in here. <br/><a href="http://www.prwatch.org/tsigfy.html" rel="nofollow">Toxic Sludge Is Good For You!</a><br/><br/><br/>Then there's Paul and John's profession. <br/><br/>Allow me to take the concept of 'identifying with a product' and apply it to the very personal way in which Paul identified his Self with his Job, above.  (Until then, the discussion was about marketing in the abstract.)<br/><br/>Liking his job is Paul's prerogative.  But hold on a sec.   Paul's personal testimonial would be easier to take at face value, if he weren't a marketer.  Because personal testimonials are a marketing tactic.<br/>Is Paul speaking entirely without guile?  Or is he marketing Marketing?!<br/>Having identified himself quite personally with Marketing, it's hard to tell where it ends and he begins.  <br/><br/>Likewise, I confess that I've been standoffish in my few interactions with John.  This began with too many well-intended suggestions from other people, "You're from New York? You need to meet John!"    So when I finally met him, I had this niggling feeling that I couldn't just meet John without buying-in wholesale to a nerdnyc Thing.   I was icy.  I felt bad.<br/><br/>But learning that John's profession is marketing--- I wonder if my gut was right?    I'd rather not be networked into a peer to peer social database or whatever.   It's good to hear John worry above, about the ethical implications of marketing.  But what's to stop HIS r-cortex, limbic system, and neocortex from retro-justifying (in his head) professional abuse of his knowledge of MY r-cortex, limbic, etc.?  It's creepy.<br/><br/>PERSONAL areas such as friendship and peer groups-- become marketing fodder. Personal interactions become marketing opportunities.<br/><br/>Levi's OP question delves into some very personal matters, to what end?  Boosting sales of playthings.<br/><br/>Paul took abstract criticism of marketing, and personalized it with his testimonial; and then Elizabeth went one step further-- framing the discussion as a personal attack on Paul as an 'asshole'.   Deeming marketing's critics 'idiots' and 'dicks'.  <br/><br/>We're all worse off when the level of discourse sinks that far.<br/><br/>I can't help but think we'd all be better off if we kept a respectful distance from each other.<br/><br/>I am accusing 'marketing' of violating respectful distance-- via intrusive, duplicitous behavior;<br/>disguised helping me or being my friend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268015/#Comment_268015" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T00:48:10+00:00" title="April 21, 2010 12:48AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>When such<span style="color: #666633;">aggressive</span>marketing attempts as DragonLance and 2nd Ed.

Even in the 70s, when I was hanging out in hobby shops, I saw plenty of advertisements about OD&amp;D, 1st ed D&amp;D, and other games.  They all had "house organs," like The Space Gamer, because that was how they marketed.  As I understand it, marketing is just the use of persuasion to sell products, advance agendas and ideologies, etc.  And it's not just to consumers, it's also to middle men.  That you were able to buy your games at all was because TSR and other companies used marketing to get their games on the shelves of the stores you bought them at.<br/><br/>At some point, this thread stopped being a discussion and turned into emotional attempts at persuasion.<br/><br/>Here's just an observation: this thread is no longer about marketing.  It <b>is</b> marketing, and some of it is aggressive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What

me or being my friend.</blockquote>\nI'm willing to accept that point of view as valid <i>where</i> one can assume the existence of such a distance.  But, thing is, I don't accept that such a thing as "respectful distance" normally exists when communication is taking place.<br/><br/>You find it creepy for one person to get into the head of another person, and that seems odd to me.  Not because it doesn't take place - it absolutely does.  But because that's the <i>usual state of affairs</i>, from my viewpoint.  We're in one another's heads all the time, every time we communicate.<br/><br/>And, yes, an huge segment of communication has "buy this!" or, to get more general, "buy <i>into</i> this!" as the motive behind it.  That's a real thing.  <br/><br/>But from where I sit, once this becomes visible, either we can spend our time running away from the possibility of 'selling out'.  Or we can <i>live in the world we have</i>, warts, all, looking for approaches that do good things without doing harm.<br/><br/>Communication <b>means</b> being in each other's heads.  Your parking-lot-rape analogy is in my head; it's not without effects.  Why did you decide to use your time in my head to throw that image around?<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite>Here's just an observation: this thread is no longer about marketing.  It<b>is</b>marketing, and some of it is aggressive.</blockquote>\nBy the implied definition in the first post, it always was.  I asked people to consider "If this is true, then what else is true?".  Which is a request to frame <i>your thinking</i> in the form described.<br/><br/>And so are most posts, in most threads, by the same definition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268020/#Comment_268020" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T02:06:42+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  2:06AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...that's probably a lot like the weird mindfuck you get when you discover someone is a psychologist. Are they dissecting me? Am I having a real conversation with this person or am I being analyzed? Can I be honest with this person or will some slip of the tongue reveal my deepest secrets?<br/><br/>The short version: Marketing (like psychology) isn't magic powers. It's not coercive. Again, read the wikipedia entry. Bill Burdick, I encourage you to scroll up a bit and find that link. You will hopefully see that your definition of marketing -- "the use of persuasion to sell products, advance agendas and ideologies, etc." -- is incorrect. Or at least incomplete.<br/><br/>On (effectively) being called a liar by Todd: speaking of maintaining respectful distance, please don't do that.<br/><br/>I promise I have nothing personal to gain from sharing my story, other than to clarify what marketing is and is not. It's not like *anyone* in the indie gaming scene has the budget to afford this stuff. OTOH I've handed out many, many hours of free advice to folks who simply don't understand how to connect their creations to an audience. Again, I'm just not seeing how this is intrusive, duplicitious or anything else. If you're not sure, just follow the money. Who's gaining what? <br/><br/>The whole "marketing is eeevil and must not be trusted" thing is just so tiresome. It's precisely the same space as "all cops are pigs" and "lawyers are scumbags" and "government can't be trusted" and all the other generalizations. It's lazy and dishonest, and it does the OP a disservice.<br/><br/>On that note, what possible motivation could the marketing-bashers have when they have no stake in how Levi markets his playthings? Social cred? Looking cool to strangers? A sincere interest in protecting poor innocent bystanders from...what? Being sold a plaything.

Which is advocacy.  Which is marketing -- they're trying to find, in this market of readers here, other people who will support their position and convert people of different positions to their position.  Would that profit them?  Yes, I think it would.  I think there is a real profit motive going on there.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to point fingers and call people hypocrites, I'm just trying to say that it doesn't look like people are actually objecting to <b>marketing</b> here, it really looks like they're objecting to dishonest or unethical behavior which they associate with marketing.<br/><br/>I brought up The Space Gamer, because gamers loved reading magazines like it and Strategy &amp; Tactics.  These were marketing vehicles, like all "house organs" are.  Like all house organs, however, they also contain valuable stuff.  Kind of like Story-Games does.  There's this "directed self promotion" category for marketing here.  Do all these people who just hate marketing want to get rid of this category on Story-Games?  How do they think people should find out about anything anyone does?<br/><br/>I, for one, <b>want</b> to hear from the game designers here about what they're doing and I hope some of them do some good marketing and try to find out what kinds of games we're interested in playing -- I'm happy to provide marketing feedback to them because I want to buy interesting games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268022/#Comment_268022" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T03:41:44+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  3:41AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I promise I have nothing personal to gain from sharing my story, other than to clarify what marketing is and is not.</blockquote>\nBut you do, Paul.

And when I used to do marketing, that's mostly what I was doing. Designing images and user interfaces. Like websites, iphone apps, and other tools. <br/><br/>Marketing is a pretty wide field. Are the people who design D&amp;D covers bad to? I guess it depends on which edition :-)<br/><br/>I have friends who are therapists, psychologists, lawyers, police, union workers, and government employees who used to never tell people what they did unless they knew them really well. I never understood why but they would tell me horror stories of ruined first impressions once someone knew they were a therapist. I've come very close myself to no longer saying I work in marketing and sticking to my actual job title as creative director or head of digital &amp; creative. <br/><br/>In terms of neuroscience and how the brain works, that and semiotics were all areas I've read about in my own journey for truth and understanding people. I had a very hard life growing up, my immediate family were victims of WW2, poor and homeless for several years, and then frequently victimized as gullible immigrants new to America. The things I saw people do to my parents horrified me. Once they got on their feet and opened up a restaurant (yes, they were Greek, and yes they started a diner) the local mafia had arsonists burn down their business. It was always astonishing to me what people are capable of. Later I had friends join cults who seemed to have control over them I couldn't possibly begin to understand. So I spent a lot of time studying anti-coercion techniques, media literacy, ethics, and semiotics. And I've helped a lot of friends in these situations. <br/><br/>My interest in psychology isn't about marketing. It's about understanding why people do bad things. My involvement in marketing was due to my love of art (I'm a classically trained illustrator) and comics. The parts I hate about marketing and avoid, I'm aware and sensitive to because I understand how serious these issues are and because of how important fairness and truth are to me. So you can imagine how frustrating it is for me to be somehow categorized with dishonest people who buy and sell people's emails. That's so alien to me I can't even begin to explain or understand.<br/><br/>Todd, when we first met at CampNerdly, I talked about nerdnyc for 2 minutes because Emily Care Boss asked me to and said you wanted to know about nerdnyc. Beyond that, I barely talked about nerdnyc. I spent the rest of the time talking to you about art and then defending your enjoyment of burlesque after someone at the table called it sexist because of some cards you had that feminist friends of mine also had. Not much marketing going on there (and as I mentioned above, I'm mainly a creative director, and sometimes that falls within marketing departments). <br/><br/>In terms of nerdnyc, it's a non profit, highly transparent, with leaders and organizers made up dedicated people in the community. It's something where in the past I spent my own money helping other people meet new people to game with since when you first move to NYC it can be intimidating and lonely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268045/#Comment_268045" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T08:26:10+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  8:26AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2010 8:35AM by Todd_L.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything you say is 100% true, John.<br/><br/>My post would be totally paranoid, without your post to complete the picture.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wait, so if you are a creative director, graphic designer, writer, print and web interface user tester, who has done work in analytics...<br/><br/>...you can't be trusted? </span><br/><br/>Yes.  That is what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Levi asked an intimate question.   <br/>When some of the replies above contained an element of hostility,<br/>a contingent of marketing professionals took umbrage.    This strikes me as unprofessional.  <br/>I mean-- isn't it really common for marketers to get a wildly negative reaction to their queries?<br/>Aren't good marketers supposed to cooly listen to the angry replies, rather than stoop to personal defensiveness?<br/><br/>I attribute the defensiveness to a personalized identification with the ethos of marketing.  And yes-- all those marketing-related fields you listed are apt to adopt a marketing worldview (not unlike how embeded journalists in 2003 found themselves agreeing with the Pentagon's POV?)<br/><br/>Likewise the story games community is going to be skewed toward certain biases.  Example: given the prevalence of .pdf creators here, it's to be expected that certain views on intellectual property are prevalent.<br/><br/>Some parts of this community share class interests,class viewpoints, and agendas.<br/>And those agendas may collide with other parts of the community. <br/>If anyone wants to use marketing tools to locate the exact points of friction, fine.<br/>But if the next step, upon locating the friction, is to raise hackles and fight until marketing 'wins', <br/>how is that different from any other point-of-view that positions itself as the One True Way and attempts to pave-over dissenting opinions?<br/><br/>I know that none of this is news.<br/>I'm not telling you this to school you.<br/>I'm saying it to demonstrate that my position isn't as wildly inane as it might seem, had I said a bit less.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite><br/>On that note, what possible motivation could the marketing-bashers have when they have no stake in how Levi markets his playthings?

The number keeps going up. 6,000 doesn't seem impossible to you, does it? 20,000?  After all, 3,000 is only the <i>average</i>.  And everywhere we turn, it's reaching out for more and more things. It chokes us, it strangles us, it pollutes the air, the air-waves, the conversation, the music, the very sky is not complete without a few billboards stacked against it with the faces of realtors smiling benignly down like your favorite pagan god might.  But this is not the thread, and it isn't my point, nor has it ever been.<br/><br/>I select a volume of Dickens from the shelf - the cover is marketing, the font is marketing, the name "Charles Dickens" is marketing, and now Levi tells me that <i>my</i> selection of Dickens over Hugo, or Elmore Leonard is not just me picking out what I want to read, but is best interpreted as a response to marketing, as though I wish to commune not with Charles Dickens or even Little Nell, but with the publisher's design man, and tell him and the world what sort of man I am that would choose Dickens at this point in my life. No, I just want to read some Dickens, in peace, perhaps the bit where he wrote, "There are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts."  Can anyone think that this statement is praising the commercial worthiness of the backs and covers of books rather than criticizing the artistry of the parts in between? <br/><br/>Fine, I get it, the war against marketing is over and marketing won, by a score of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 to 0. We live in the best of all possible worlds, if you don't believe it, wait until the commercial break and someone will tell you what to buy so that it can be. But can't <i>I</i> at least choose not to be a marketer? Can't I just enjoy something without it being my identity - an identity which I am selling to others? Can't I buy and play a game without saying something about myself? Can't I choose to remain mum, or enjoy something on its artistic merits, rather than my own commercial one?  Is it too much to ask that I not be drafted into this apparently endlessly escalating war between business and the fruits of my labor? I'm already targeted by 3,000 weapons a day, am I not allowed to throw down my own and say, no, I do not wish to fight?

They picked that game because it shows signs of "things I'd like to be associated with", or "things I could be and do in the context of play".</blockquote>\nDoes this talk about creating an identity?  No, it talks about revealing an identity that's already there.\n<blockquote>I don't care about the game you made; in and of itself.  I care about<b>me</b>.  And your game might, or might not, slot into the story I tell myself about my life and my identity.</blockquote>\nOK, expressing my identity, not defining it there...\n<blockquote>I might buy an indie games for the indie-ness, this week.  I might avoid doing so next week.  I might buy it because you wrote it, or avoid it for the same reason.  This is true of any identifier you care to slap on a game.  Complaining about either one means you don't understand, bone deep, that even when I'm buying a game because you wrote it, I'm not buying it for you; I'm buying it because in the story I tell myself about who I am, I buy games from cool people that I like.

I don't think anyone would object to the thesis that bad people doing bad things is bad.<br/><br/>I think this whole thread went off the rails the moment John invoked brain science. <i>What the hell, the limbic system? I knew those fuckers would stop at nothing to sell their wares!</i> <br/><br/>Invoking science is scary if you don't understand the science. It's all fancy words and new ideas, and it's no surprise that people get scared around it. And in a perfect example of <i>the very science we're talking about</i>, those scared people rationalize their fear. The fact that (some) marketers know something about theories of decision-making becomes a justification, a rationale for their prejudices. And then Bill Hicks gets name-checked, other Bill Hicks fans (me included!) feel reassured that Todd L is an in-the-know hipster <i>just like me/you/him/her,</i> and ignorant people are no less ignorant.<br/><br/>Because many of us are gamers-of-a-certain-persuasion, let me bounce this old chestnut off all y'all: Theories about brain science and decisionmaking are <i>descriptive</i>, not <i>prescriptive</i>. Will some folks try to use brain science in a prescriptive way? Sure, you bet. Does it work? Not ethically, if you're trying to use those tools to lie more effectively.<br/><br/>Similarly, Big Model talk invokes a similar level of dread among (many) gamers, particularly the ignorant ones. It's all fancy words and new ideas, and it's no surprise that people get scared around it. And you explain to them "but it's just descriptive! It doesn't work very well as a prescriptive theory!" But the fear is already there, the prejudices have already taken hold, and all that's left to do is tear down the theory and the personalities involved.<br/><br/>(NB I wonder how people would feel about brain science being used prescriptively in game design?)<br/><br/>Jeff Z proposed that I do have something to gain, and it's true that nobody likes having their profession hated (lawyers might; the ones I know have a warped sense of humor). But I thought about that a bit. You know what it really is that bugs me? I don't like the possibility of being associated with ignorant, scared people. The odds of that are vanishingly small in the real world -- there are like five Arizonans on s-g and I've already met most of them. But there's the larger affinity group of participants on this board and gamers in general. So in brain-science-speak: my emotions are affinity and embarrassment and my rationale is that if only I can educate people, I will feel less discomfort at the possibility of being associated with these people.<br/><br/>I've always freely shared my own personal theories and experiences with marketing. My business is built on radical transparency and honesty -- marketing, web development, analytics are all sacred priesthoods and I FUCKING HATE SACRED PRIESTHOODS. My clients and friends make better and more sustainable decisions when they are well informed.<br/><br/>Anyway, there it is.<br/><br/>Jason is right that we are constantly, perpetually surrounded by persuasion efforts. Would you not be better armed to identify and reject the unethical ones if you better understood the science of what your own brain does with them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268091/#Comment_268091" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T11:24:11+00:00" title="April 21, 2010 11:24AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2010 11:24AM by Jesse.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I find the act of revealing our identity through consumerism repugnant.</blockquote>\nAs the *sole* expression of identity, yeah, sure.<br/><br/>As *part of* an expression of identity that's probably true.

In any event, your choices, habits, and mannerisms, in no matter what area, the way you eat, how you interact with people, what you buy, ... do reveal things about you.  Ask your friends, I'm sure they've noticed interesting things about you based on what you do.  If you look at some Sherlock Holmes stories, you'll see that this is a big topic there.  How your buying habits reveal things about you is only the tip of the iceberg.

He just talked about some stuff, which included people paying money for games but also some other stuff, such as people reading games for free.<br/><br/>Joe was the first person to say "marketing" and it looks like he was using it to mean something like "present a game such that people are interested in playing it" and not, say, "professional marketing tactics that are specifically designed to separate consumers from their dollars."<br/><br/>Now, the fact that he's using a capitalist metaphor? That's a thing, and a problematic one obviously. It's also super-common, like when you try to convince your buddy that no, man, what's REALLY going on in Star Wars is that it's way in the FUTURE, and Coruscant is Earth after we've paved over the whole planet and expanded throughout the galaxy, and it's a cautionary tale for future civilizations, and your buddy's like, "sorry man, I'm just not sold on that."<br/><br/>Common, yeah, <i>permeating society</i>, even. But being common doesn't make it any less problematic. In fact that's partly WHY it's problematic.<br/><br/>I've noticed a weird and disturbing thing happen for me. Like, this rant by Bill Hicks:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>I know what all the marketing people are thinking right now too, "Oh, you know what Bill's doing, he's going for that anti-marketing dollar. That's a good market, he's very smart."<br/><br/>Oh man, I am not doing that. You fucking evil scumbags!<br/><br/>"Ooh, you know what Bill's doing now, he's going for the righteous indignation dollar. That's a big dollar. A lot of people are feeling that indignation. We've done research - huge market. He's doing a good thing."<br/><br/>Godammit, I'm not doing that, you scum-bags! Quit putting a godamm dollar sign on every fucking thing on this planet!<br/><br/>"Ooh, the anger dollar. Huge. Huge in times of recession. Giant market, Bill's very bright to do that."<br/><br/>God, I'm just caught in a fucking web.<br/><br/>"Ooh the trapped dollar, big dollar, huge dollar. Good market - look at our research. We see that many people feel trapped. If we play to that and then separate them into the trapped dollar..."<br/><br/>How do you live like that? And I bet you sleep like fucking babies at night, don't you?<br/><br/>"What didya do today honey?"<br/><br/>"Oh, we made ah, we made ah arsenic a childhood food now, goodnight." [snores] "Yeah we just said you know is your baby really too loud? You know?" [snores] "Yeah, you know the mums will love it." [snores]<br/><br/>Sleep like fucking children, don't ya, this is your world isn't it?</blockquote>\n...and this rant by JD:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>the average American is exposed to around 3,000 ads per day - that's 3,000 marketers screaming at us in bright colors, loud noises and capitalized words every day of our lives, every moment we are in public someone is selling us something, much of the time when we are in "private", that time too belongs to marketing. The number keeps going up. 6,000 doesn't seem impossible to you, does it? 20,000?  After all, 3,000 is only the<i>average</i>.  And everywhere we turn, it's reaching out for more and more things. It chokes us, it strangles us, it pollutes the air, the air-waves, the conversation, the music, the very sky is not complete without a few billboards stacked against it with the faces of realtors smiling benignly down like your favorite pagan god might.</blockquote>\n...are both railing against a thing that I too, hate, that I chafe under and lose sleep over. I fear the death of privacy, of advertisements in dreams, of the Gap scanning my retinas to pull up my purchasing history when I walk through the door. I seethe in fury at arsenic sold for children, and a million other such crimes. Yet I've been painted into the corner of (seemingly) defending "marketing" because I accepted that capitalist metaphor in the course of the thread, and nodded along with some good ideas that were couched in those terms, and alluvasudden some folks charged in with a negative, invasive, even <i>abusive</i> model of "marketing" based on some very cynical and unethical practices, and I find the ground's shifted under me and I find that in wanting to find better ways to be authentic AND communicate that authenticity I've been "made" to defend something I hate.<br/><br/>My point in all that is: the capitalist metaphor is OBVIOUSLY tripping people up. And the more I think about it, in the awful light Jeff Zahari and others have exposed it to, I'm really not feeling great about it myself. And no matter how many times people say "I don't think we're using 'marketing' to mean the same thing," that very unfavorable vision of the concept simply WILL NOT GO AWAY.<br/><br/>It's impeding discussion. So I'm abandoning it. Joe's abandoning it by starting a new thread; I'm abandoning it by just not using the word "marketing." What word should I replace it with? I don't know; maybe "personal statement"? That's what Levi started with, more or lkess, and maybe if we cal it something like that we can get the haters off our backs.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268232/#Comment_268232" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T00:11:04+00:00" title="April 22, 2010 12:11AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2010 12:13AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>In his original post Levi never used the word "marketing."</blockquote>\nWait, what?

However!  It has two assumptions I'd dig at as "Waitaminute":<br/><br/>1) That there's serious competition in the marketing of these games.   And, honestly, I'd say that independent game producers are presently marketing so little that this isn't true - at least not <i>yet</i>.  The firing gun might conceivably have gone off, but if there's a race to the bottom to be had, it hasn't raced that far, yet.  For myself, in marketing, I'm flailing clumsily, not plotting carefully.<br/><br/>2) That the people making these games believe bad-faith marketing serves their interests.  And that's tricky.

The only time it's not awesome is if I want to make 50 copies to sell at cost, then someone convinces me that I should sell 100 for profit, but I'm not prepared for it, haven't produced something of high quality, and don't want to do any of the stuff I need to do to make that happen.</p>\n<p>If you're an independent publisher, it means you, and only you, are responsible for your successes and failures. Folks on this forum will give you all sorts of stupid advice about how you "should" publish. Some of it might be good advice <em>disguised</em> as stupid advice. Most of it isn't. Only you can determine your own success, and that can only be done by setting out to achieve a modest level of success, and then determining where to go from there. Maybe you accomplished what you set out to accomplish (see Judd Karlman with Dictionary of Mu). Or maybe you want to take what you learned and do something else, or maybe modify your existing product to be closer to the thing you wanted it to be.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268384/#Comment_268384" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T15:20:23+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  3:20PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Obviously you have seen the true nature of The Matrix.<br/><br/>Making a purchase is really no different from any other action. It conveys a message whether we want it to or not, and is susceptible to interpretation error. Most of the time we are not consciously aware of the messages we are conveying and responding to, and when we are, we typically use a set of codified and institutionalized actions that reduce translation errors to convey them called language.<br/><br/>Some people get squicked by marketing because they see it as a product defining them, as opposed to them <i>using</i> a product to define themselves. The clothes do not make the man, but damn if I'm not going to dress well to show everyone else how awesome I am. On the other hand, bad things can happen when the message is misinterpreted. I mean, I love 'Nazi chic', but I don't think it takes a genius to see how the message conveyed might be one of <i>'I'm a racist fascist bastard'</i> as opposed to one of <i>'I have excellent taste in clothing</i>'.<br/><br/>The thing a lot of people seem to forget is that marketing is a form of hypnosis, and like all hypnosis, it cannot make you do something you do not want to. And a lot of those annoying internet ads are actually backfiring on their intended purpose. I may be aware of what 'Diamond Finish' is, but when I see it I think, no, <i>feel</i>annoyed. No way I'm buying it with that mindset.<br/><br/>Sorry, I'm mostly talking to myself, though I hope people get something from my internal monologue.

But if it is used prescriptively, then the opposite is true, and I consider this use more 'honest'. Forge Theory is also often accused of being purely descriptive, but I haven't found that to be true. A theory that doesn't help me design is a theory I have no interest in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

So I guess it's a bit hard to sell the game when you are actually buying an aspect of yourself, and it might be a different aspect from the same game in different times. So it might help if the game has multiple such slots for you to insert yourself into.<br/><br/>If it makes sense?<br/><br/>Edit: I'm with Joe and Levi, but I seem to get more approval in other arenas of my life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11973/what-do-i-say-about-myself-if-i-buy-and-play-your-game" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11973/what-do-i-say-about-myself-if-i-buy-and-play-your-game" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11973/what-do-i-say-about-myself-if-i-buy-and-play-your-game/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11973%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11973%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
