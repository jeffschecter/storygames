By the time we'd played two games, we were all friendly and full of energy and enthusiasm for more "serious" gaming.  <br/><br/>One fun moment - Clinton, as a villager , made a very cogent argument about who the werewolf must be, based on some mathematical deduction.  I immediately cried "He's talking in numbers!  Kill him!"  And we did.  <br/><br/>In this case it was an informal house-con, so I asked "who has something to run?" and we put up sticky notes and voted on various games.  One of the suggestions was "Five more games of Werewolf!".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175534/#Comment_175534" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T06:43:54+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  6:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's fun!

General comments:<br/><br/>* Perennial Kills - Fact: If you are wearing a red shirt, you're about 80% likely to be eliminated in the first lynching. God help you if you're particularly hirsute.<br/><br/>* Alternate Productions - The Mafia theme was the original, but I think the werewolf theme is a good one for play at cons (kids, non-gamers). Also, it's worth noting that the Werewolf thing was actually a part of Princeton's "official" rules, for playing with really massive groups or for a variant--there would be werewolves AND mafia in the same game, in opposition to each other and the villagers. Further, being open source means that, frankly, there's a TON of alternate themes/productions possible (I want to do a Cthulhu-themed one with Cultists, the Psychic, Scholars, etc--another ripe one is a sci fi "body snatchers" one).<br/><br/>* Optional Roles - The biggest problem with these is when to add them--what populations of players (similar to the "when do we add another werewolf" metrics). That's why, I think, the MAIN value-add (other than evocative art and role rules on the cards) would be testing to figure out what roles should be added in what order, based on population. I have also discussed (on RPG.net, with Mike Young, IIRC) a game in which EVERY villager role has some kind of day or night function, to avoid the "dull," do-nothing villager role. This may or may not be doable (could require much less powerful roles).<br/><br/>* Best Optional Roles - The Masons roles are pretty sweet: basically, they get a "wake at night" stage, first night, during which they get to identify each other, thus reducing the number of possible werewolf suspects. They are sort of like "mini Seers" in that they can self-sacrifice, to reveal that "we're the Masons, so those other folks must be the wolves" (and the wolves can fake that), and in the way that they become a prime target if they admit their roles. Little Girl is OK, but it can be a bitch to adjudicate--the wolves as often as not reveal themselves to neighboring players by the mad gesticulations they do to show they've caught the Girl. And meanwhile, she's the ultimate Seer--it's common for her to reveal herself and say, "Him, her, and her are the wolves; I'm the little girl; I'll die tonight, I'm sure." (Then clever wolves DON'T kill her, and she gets lynched... giving them only one "free" night.)<br/><br/>* Best Possible Play - Yet, as it works, the "pure" game is generally the best. it's VERY hard to balance roles against population, and some roles lead to potential stalemates (Leather Jacket and Mayor being the two worst culprits). And other roles just speed the game up too much, reducing the potential for interaction and deduction (Vigilante, Devil, Archangel). Andy Looney (generally considered a strong game designer and theorist) concurs with the basic game, which is why Looney labs is reluctant to release an expansion for AYAW (or a new version, with more roles).<br/><br/>* As An Icebreaker - Yep, it's a game that even non-gamers love after one or two games. Old, young (not TOO young, though--wee ones often ruin a game), male, female. And it's SO easy to run anywhere--use playing cards, like Mafia. Or Keep my soon-to-be-released thin card pack in a pocket or purse. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I could, obviously, go on and on...

I'll give this a shot, Jason.<br/><br/>* I Have A Secret - The fact that the wolves and Seer have a duty to perform which, perforce, means they should not reveal themselves, seems to generate the fun  of being a wolf or seer (or other, optional role).<br/><br/>* Real Skills - We aren't pretending to fly or use magic; we're using our actual observation, memory, deduction, and persuasion skills to play and, hopefully, win. On that....<br/><br/>* Zero-Sum Gamist Play - It plays fairly fast, to an obvious conclusion, and typically has a very small "winner" group (often only two villagers or one wolf remains). Winning carries with it an obvious social reinforcement, because you won with Real Skill, not dicing or min-maxing a system (which  appeals to grognards, sure, but not to most "casual" players).<br/><br/>* Physical Interaction - The noise-making by everyone at night, the wolves trying to coordinate their unanimous kill vote at night, some optional role rules (Little Girl, in particular)--all these make for engaging play, something to occupy yourself with during what might be a dull period (night). Also, there's some metagaming that can be done with the noise-making--one of my favorite things to do is to play a sort of contretemps to the group's hand-slapping, making unusual rhythms out what normal ends up synchronized (folks tend to slap their thigh or the floor in a common rhythm).<br/><br/>* No Distractions - No rule book to pour over, no character sheet to consult, no math to do, no dice to count out and sort and roll and resort. Instead, just eye contact and conversation (and demagoguery).<br/><br/>* Emergent Complexity - First game with newbs is one way... but by the fifth or sixth game, folks are developing strategies for play; and strategies emerge in specific groups that won't emerge elsewhere, with other sets of players. For instance, I tend to drift into being a very BAD logician and accuser (intentionally) in order to accomplish two things: (1) make the wolves happy to keep me alive, as I am "clearly" off base and so (2) I can often, late game, watch reactions to my totally wrong ranting and figure out at least one wolf, if not all of them. Basically, anyone who agrees with me or looks overly satisfied with my ability to sow discord is likely to be a wolf.<br/><br/>I'll give it some more thought... but I think the above captures a lot of it.

It does seem that werewolves entered the "mindspace" through Zarf, though. But it would have been, like, less than half a year for it to hit the Princeton page, who actually speaks about the werewolf versus mafia variant for the first time (which, admittedly, is a variant on 'two families").<br/><br/>Anyhow, attribution is due to Plotkin if you use werewolf themes.<br/>----------\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite>There already is a Cthulhu-themed variant called<a href="http:////www.funagain.com/control/product/~product_id=016619/~AFFIL=YETI" rel="nofollow">Do You Worship Cthulhu?</a>, but it doesn't sound as elaborate as your idea.</blockquote>Must be where i got the idea--I'm rarely innovative.<br/><br/>And its more complex than Are You A Werewolf--it has Protectors (which I presume serve as Mayors--prevent a day lynching--or Doctors--preventing a night kill, maybe) and Vigilantes (which almost have to be night killers).<br/><br/>I'd just theme a bit differently (i.e. I wouldn't use a mafia-theme role name) and include a LOT more optional roles--or make every villager have some more-minor role--and provide good stat analysis of when a role should be included based on population (and even other roles' presence). That latter bit is the sticking point--I can find Public Domain art from the 20s and easily layout the cards themselves. It's the rules advice bit that would take some math crunching and frequent testing.

Like, it will sway the (theoretical) 50/50 chance of winning to somewhere around 80/20 (in favor of the aliens). Might be a feature, not a flaw--it would make villager survival really sweet.<br><br>OR... hmmm.... what if the aliens don't know who each other are? There's a chance that they'd waste a night turning each other (or one turning the other); and as their numbers increase, the odds of that increase. The Moderator would just have to number them--which would make night slow--as they are turned in the night. Hmmm... and a handling problem, there: the Mod would have to somehow awaken, touch, or alert the newly-converted alien so that they know they've been turned and so that they can learn their number (though it should be obvious--it's sequential). They needn't know WHO converted them, though--another variant option.<br/><br/>Doh! But THAT could make for a geometric progression: two converted night one, four night two, eight night three--done, for a full group of 16 (2 starting aliens). Damn. It won't work, as I see it. The aliens have to know each other and vote who to convert, in a single stage of night. Then you got the handling problem, and it's still going to heavily favor the aliens. And having only one starting alien doesn't really mitigate that much.<br/><br/>Worth thought (in another thread, perhaps, though it helps Jason with the kid planning, I suppose).<br/>----------<br/>I like the spies and double-agents idea, myself, as a retheme. But, hell, what do The Kids Today get into at that age, anyway? Maybeit could be, like, <i>American Idol: The Bloodletting</i> (reminiscent of that spoof movie)--the kids are all Idol contestants, but two of them are secretly attacking contestants in the night and forcing them to smoke unfiltered cigarettes, which ruins their voices and Simon Carless gives them shit and they run off crying. No death, just singer sabotage and a vicious Moderator role, once the other contestants pick someone to boot off the show (yeah, which blurs the lines of role between contestants and judges).<br/><br/>Just a thought. But I'd approach re-themeing for a specific audience by looking at what piques their interests in other entertainment media, rather than spit-balling ideas (which was sort of what I meant for a new thread--a spooge of Mafia theme ideas, which might prompt a new product).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175930/#Comment_175930" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T10:02:47+00:00" title="October 23, 2008 10:02AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonatan Kilhamn</cite>Clinton:<br/>I've seen a version very much like that take place on forum.rollspel.nu, the swedish RPG forum.

Each player had a card indicating which character they were from the Shakespeare play, and if they were a conspirator or not.  Additional rules (since this was supposed to be educational) was that you had to explain who your character was if he or she was killed, and if you couldn't, you had to read a page of the play out loud instead.  Also, if Caesar's player was killed, the game ended immediately.  It was a big hit with the class, and they spent more time playing it than the teacher had allowed for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176565/#Comment_176565" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T08:50:43+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  8:50AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The point is to <i>avoid </i>the idolization of gangsters and to <i>avoid </i>making lynching a component of gameplay.
