It's not what I understand as "old school" at all, but that's another thread.<br/><br/>What I found interesting was the way "Discern Realities" works, or in the case of some of our play, doesn't work.<br/><br/>"Discern Realities" is not "Spot Hidden". Using it when the characters might or might not notice something important doesn't work at all. That's not how the move is designed to work, and when you try to use it that way, it feels awkward and weird. For example, my character is eavesdropping on some guards talking. They're far away and he can't make out what they're saying very clearly. I could roll "Discern Realities", but none of the questions really work here.<br/><br/>But there's a very strong instinct to make some kind of move in a situation like that. So what to do?<br/><br/>I propose a new move to cover those situations (you can hand-write it in your book once it arrives):<br/><br/><b>When you might notice something important</b>, DM, tell the player what they hear, see, smell, and feel.<br/><br/>In other words, don't roll the dice. Tell the player what the character notices. Do it all the time! When there's a trap in a corridor, don't roll any dice! Tell them what they hear, see, smell, and feel. Most traps, ambushes, etc should have a few telltale signs. Let the players know about these! Don't roll dice, just tell them. It's better that way. They'll still blunder into plenty of traps and ambushes and things, but they'll do it because they weren't paying attention to you, not because of a bad dice roll.<br/><br/>While we're at it:<br/><br/>Who needs "Discern Realities"? The questions are fun but they're awkward a lot of the time. I think it'd be fun to distribute them out to each of the classes, to be used whenever they like. Thieves can have "What should I be on the lookout for?" Fighters can have "Who is really in charge here?", Rangers "What happened here recently?" and so on. You still get +1 for acting on the answers. I think it'd be cool.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn" title="Murgh_Bpurn"><img alt="Murgh_Bpurn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn">Murgh_Bpurn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383961/#Comment_383961" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T04:42:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  4:42AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the character eavesdropping, if he can't quite hear what they're saying, then maybe he's being a bit careless and putting himself in danger of being noticed (defy danger)?<br/><br/>If a thief hasn't got hold for a trap, then I would play a soft move against anyone that is getting close to triggering it.<br/><br/>I like discern realities, it allows the GM to give pertinent information to the players and advance the plot as necessary. And you get a bonus when acting on that info!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383962/#Comment_383962" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T05:21:30+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  5:21AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you are just describing the conversation Simon. You can make it a custom move if you like, but really, if the players <b><i>want</i></b> to notice something important, ask how and what they are doing and most importantly, <b><i>why</i></b>. Dig a little. Slow down. Establish an intent. If it sounds like a move - Defy Danger or Discern Realities for instance -  then roll with it. If you have an idea as GM as to what might be going on (say because of your prep) then use that as a grim portent, sign of doom or announcing an unwelcome truth. If you have no idea then disclaim the decision and pass it off to the players. Get them to tell the group about the ambushes, traps, telltale signs, smells, sights and sounds. You can then build on this. Ask questions and use the answers.<br/><br/>If you find the questions on Discern Realities a bit limiting, then get the players to ask whatever they want, but use the lens of the list to establish your answer. Use a 'best fit' paradigm. At higher levels, an advanced custom discern reality move based on class is a great idea. I like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383963/#Comment_383963" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T05:37:08+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  5:37AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feels weird to me to have a move for not rolling dice. Of course, that's the whole point of custom moves - to make moves that fit your group and what you're doing at the table.<br/><br/>But basically, if I eavesdrop, then the MC just tells me what I hear or don't hear, according to their principles (prep, honesty, etc).<br/><br/>MC: "You hear muffled sounds from behind the door. What do you do?"<br/>Player: "I creep closer quietly [might trigger a move] and press my ear to the door."<br/>MC: "You hear...[principles-&gt;MC move]. What do you do?"<br/><br/>If the MC doesn't want to tell them what they hear, they are protecting some information, for whatever reason. And if the guards are far away or whatever and the MC simply can't decide how well the PC hears the conversation, disclaim decision making. Roll a random die, ask another player what makes sense, make a new custom move (like "<b>When you try to make sense of unclear information</b>, roll +wis. On 10+ you see or hear it clearly, on 7-9 the MC will give you an impression, on a miss you misinterpret or overreach in your inquiry.")<br/><br/>Otherwise, I agree that telling them what they see and hear is just a regular MC move/part of the conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384032/#Comment_384032" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-01T05:41:01+00:00" title="July  1, 2012  5:41AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like Dungeon World is continuing the proud D&amp;D tradition of being a dozen different games in one book.

The move doesn't change how the game is played, it reminds me to play the game well.<br/><br/>I don't know about how quickly the instinct goes away. It's pretty deeply ingrained. I still get a twinge in my D&amp;D games when someone says "I search the corridor for traps" or similar.<br/><br/>My new rule for traps in D&amp;D is essentially "Roll a d20. Whatever the die says, I tell you what your character sees, smells etc." for just that reason.<br/><br/>I'm going to try divvying up the questions sometime, and see what happens. In fact, I could add it to my D&amp;D game pretty smoothly. Iiiinteresting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
