Once a month my boardgaming group plays D&amp;D (4th ed) and it\u2019s..... well, boring (you know what it\u2019s like: \u201cI check for traps\u201d DM rolls behind his screen. \u201cYou find nothing\u201d. \u201cOK, I check again\u201d, **rolls**, \u201cYou find nothing\u201d, \u201cOK, I check again\u201d etc. And as for the combat, roll, miss - roll, hit - roll, miss etc). <br/><br/>Recently I got my hands on Mouse Guard and it went down an absolute blast (after the players got over looking at their skills and stats to decide what their mice were capable of and began to actually <i>roleplay</i>).<br/><br/>So my question is this: If I want something hackable (and the \u2018Nature\u2019 stat in MG makes hacking problematic), what system do you recommend?<br/><br/>I\u2019m looking at Apocalypse World (as I hear good things about Dogs in the Vineyard by the same person, plus stuff like Ghost Lines seems mindblowing and I like the apocalyptic/supernatural vibe).<br/><br/>Or should I choose a GM-less system like Fiasco which has various different scenarios? (This seems less likely to be able to be configured into a campaign).<br/><br/>Or should I stick with MG (a system I am growing to love) and try to hack it? (Not sure if I have the mental agility to turn sword-wielding mice into a supernatural apocalypse!)<br/><br/>I love the ideas inherent in games such as Ghost/Echo and Apocalypse World that require the players to contribute to the worldbuilding. Anything that encourages proactive roleplay rather than the traditional reactive one-dimensional player responses is what I need for my group.<br/><br/>Many thanks in advance for your suggestions.<br/><br/>Alan.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406098/#Comment_406098" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T04:05:29+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  4:05AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like Mouse Guard, stick with it.

You can play perhaps one different title per month, realistically (unless you're part of a larger community where somebody else preps the games). You can read one per week, easily. Conclusion: just go out there, read some rpg texts and figure out for yourself what you like. Keep playing whatever you're playing, and once that loses its sparkle, switch to something appealing that you've found. Over time you'll develop a rough sense of what all the 10 000 rpgs published over the last few decades offer, enabling you to navigate the field.<br/><br/>Also remember that there are large numbers of free rpgs out there in the Internet, so selecting a new game doesn't need to be this elaborate ritual swearing of allegiance accompanied by a $50 tithe to the rpg company.

Apocalypse World and all its children are a great place to start, if the setting(s) appeal to you. The system is easily "hackable" (hence all the hacks), but requires quite a bit of work to hack, so starting with the pre-made hacks is a good way to go, until and unless you have the time to do so yourself. But none of those (as far as I know) make for a good "generic" game which you can use in different genres, etc. - you need a separate hack for each different game you'll want to play.<br/><br/>One game I'd highly recommend which might be well-suited to your group and your needs, as you describe them, is The Shadow of Yesterday, particularly the version called "Solar System", published by Eero Tuovinen. It's inexpensive (and there's even a free version online), easy to use in any setting you dream up, is lighter in rules than something like Mouse Guard, but has enough support for a "traditionally minded" group. It was the "darling game" in the Story Games community a handful of years back, and is a really solid and fun game.<br/><br/>Another free and easily accessible game is "Old School Hack", for light and fun fantasy adventuring.<br/><br/>Finally, an easy game to play (and also free) is Lady Blackbird, by John Harper.<br/><br/>Do a search for those three (Solar System, Old School Hack, and Lady Blackbird), and you'll have a nice starting palette to add to the various Burning Wheel and Apocalypse World-based games.<br/><br/>(I'm picking games that are free or easily accessible, tend to be enjoyable right away, and have good procedures for play which a group can grab onto very quickly and easily.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406150/#Comment_406150" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T13:29:32+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  1:29PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2013 1:29PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a> is itself a hack of The Shadow of Yesterday and parts of Burning Wheel/Mouse Guard.

Boardgamers who enjoy negotiation games such as Cosmic Encounter or Sherwood Forest are more comfortable with RPG's than players who prefer the more 'dry' games with 'Euro' mechanics where you build resource engines with minimal player interaction (such as Race for the Galaxy, Puerto Rico etc).<br/><br/>At my gaming club I know those who are going to be more 'into' the new breed of indie RPG's (they're generally playing a game involving lots of shouting rather than those studiously examining a board in silence), but I don't want to exclude those who are more 'quiet' from the glorious world of RPG's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406304/#Comment_406304" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T08:35:41+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  8:35AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you've got a few sessions of Mouse Guard under your belt you'll (probably) find that the Burning Wheel is pretty familiar as most mechanics are the same as their counterparts in Mouse Guard but more detailed. It is true that the text of Mouse Guard is better but the games themselves are very similar). <br/><br/>As for BW Beliefs vs. MG Belief+Goal, BW Beliefs are essentially a MG Belief coupled with a related Goal ("The Duke is a traitor, I must infiltrate the guard to discover who his contact is" vs. B: "The Duke is a traitor", G: "We must discover who the enemy contact is"). Especially if you have some guidelines about what different beliefs should be about getting three good beliefs down isn't quite as daunting. The standard grouping is something like this one: one belief about the current situation, one about your character's long-term goals, and one about your companions.<br/><br/>And echoing Deliverator, if you haven't gone their already, the <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel forums</a> are a good place for BWHQ-specific discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406336/#Comment_406336" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T14:42:36+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  2:42PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm of the opinion that MG does thing ass backwards.

I think I\u2019ll play 4 seasons of MG before I introduce BW \u2013 some of the players are still looking at their stats as if they define their characters limitations \u2013 it\u2019s infuriating, but hopefully they\u2019ll snap out of it (I have two patrols, Red patrol have taken to MG like a duck to water, Blue patrol are proving a little set in their D&amp;D ways).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Krippler">@Krippler</a> I have AW ordered and winging its way towards me as I type. If it proves to be more intuitive than MG I will most likely use it to game in the universe we create in Microscope. Hopefully it will be a fully interactive fleshing out of the world. I have high hopes (which normally crash down around my ears!)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/zircher">@zircher</a> Thanks for the suggestion, but I\u2019m a little wary of using a fantasy setting as I\u2019m trying to punch the players out of their D&amp;D mindset, so putting them in an unfamiliar (non sword &amp; sorcery) world will hopefully enable them to break free of their old ways. Rolling the dice in front of them (rather than behind a screen) is freaking them out but slowly they\u2019re getting used to the idea of not levelling up, no money and no treasure accumulation.
