Why? Because he seek fulfillment in a monstrous way.</li>\n<li>Frankenstein is a person. Why? Because the things he wants are things people want.</li>\n<li>Cthulu isn't a monster. The crazy scientist who wants to raise him from the deeps just to see what color his tentacles are; he's the monster.</li>\n<li>Are zombies monsters? I don't think they are.

In other words, defeating the adversary is the ultimate goal, but the immediate goal is to gather the resources, allies, etc. and develop the teamwork that you will need to achieve that ultimate goal.

Some "monsters"- such as, say, a bugbear, are really no more than animals.  There's a section for statting up "beasts", and they don't need motivations beyond things like "defend territory" and "survive."  They wouldn't necessarily fight to the death, so you just need to decide where their interests lie- one stout jab to the beak might send that bugbear running.<br/><br/>Assuming you want more intelligent monsters, then- as Eric and others here are saying- you just treat them as NPCs.  They don't need Keys exactly (why bother with experience?) but they would have motivations.  A pack of goblins in D&amp;D have basic wants- survival, power, treasure, etc.  It's not complicated, but it also doesn't necessitate a TPK either.  The characters can use those basic wants to trick them, scare them, ore even negotiate with them.<br/><br/>For the more devastating monsters- like Cthulu, or Reavers in Firefly- you just treat them as window dressing, or an environmental hazard.   Your point about "furniture" is accurate- some fights are too big, and you need to find another way around.  When I ran a TSOY FIrefly game, it was explicit that an encounter with Reavers was an un-winnable fight- you either ran or you died.  Same with Cthulu.   Some friends of mine were playing a Marvel-themed Champions game and went up against Galactus.  They went in assuming it was going to be a boss-fight, and found out that <i>you don't fight Galactus.</i>  You're just beneath his notice, and if you're lucky, you can encourage him to go somewhere else.<br/><br/>In any case, I wouldn't be afraid to stat up some fairly powerful NPCs, if you need strong, recurring villians.  One of the best recurring NPCs in our current game has a Grand Master in Scrapping, three secrets, and a 10 point Vigor pool.

If I recall correctly, Monroe (for that was the NPCs name)  first appeared with 3 Secrets (all intended to make him a super-strong "brick" opponent) and Scrapping at Adept, with a few points in his Vigor.  He was introduced as a challenge for a single PC, and served well at that, kicking that character all over the place.  Later he was brought back to face several of the PCs at once, with some minions at his side, so his Vigor got bumped up.  And then at some point he became a better fighter, probably to continue being a challenge to PCs that had improved over time.<br/><br/>The point here is really that a strong opponent and harsh stakes shouldn't be a problem, as long as it's a conflict that matters to the players and helps support their story.  As a GM, providing real risks for the PCs helps push player creativity.  When Monroe first appeared, he quickly handed out a lot of Harm (as regular conflict stakes) to the PC, demonstrating to the player that a one-on-one fight might not be possible to win.  This prompted the player to run like a rabbit and use other skills to trick him into a situation where he could win (in this case, leading him into a hail of bullets).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142415/#Comment_142415" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T09:28:59+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  9:28AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking the point I was trying to formalize before is that good, story-driving NPCs must be thought of outside of the context of the PCs and must have defined goals or drives so that they exist outside the vacuum and therefore have things to worry about and fight over.

Uh... trigger my "Key of Staying Alive?" But if Cthulhu is presented like, "He's about to stomp on your Mother with one foot, and your Lover with his other foot, who do you save?" Then he's just another part of good situation creation. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's best is when the monster is like the one from Hellraiser, and it comes to you not to destroy you, but to corrupt you.

So players trying to get off an island with taboo knowledge might find it difficult because of the raging storm (in the form of an NPC) that threatens to destroy the boats (conflict of a Resist skills, perhaps).  This hinders the character with the Key of Fraternity, who's trying to get his companion away safely, and it also gets in the way of the guy with Key of the Mission (steal taboo knowledge).  In this case, the "monster" is a challenge, a hurdle to overcome that makes things exciting, but not directly the focus of a Key.<br/><br/>Am I being helpful, or just repetitive?<br/><br/>I wish I was coming to Nerdly, so we could put all this to the test!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142431/#Comment_142431" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T10:29:31+00:00" title="May  5, 2008 10:29AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve: I'll find somebody to test this out with.

And, you might want to try one of two possible approaches:<br/>\n1) Monster is an Ability/Secret of a more human-like character. Dr Frankenstein makes a monster and now has a secret called Beast of Rage that is triggered by spending a point of vigor and does X (whatever you feel Frankenstein does)<br/>\n2) The alien intelligence can be achieved by combining keys in a non-intuitive way. Like Key of Compassion and Key of Bloodlust. Tell me that this character is not going to act in an alien way. The closest to human you get is a crusader and many people feel that the crusaders were monsters...<br/>\n  Let me know what you decide to do and how it goes, I have a game of TSOY coming up soon and I might try that out if you can get it to work...<br/>\n  Any ways, good luck!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
