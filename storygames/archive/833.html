                            I think this is my favorite quote, from Aldo Ghiozzi:<br/>
<br/>
"Technology has come around to make book publishing easier for the common writer. Between PDF purchasing and Print-On-Demand (POD), the barrier of entry has dropped considerably. One would think this would create a new Golden Age of RPGs; it has done the opposite. "                        </div>

<p>He who complains about the sad lot of RPG products currently available is now free to remedy the problem himself. I mean, what's the fucking point of being an "RPG pundit" anymore?</p>
<p>I always thought "RPG industry" was a stupid term. It conjures images in my mind of rooms full of staff writers and artists, hunched over desks, wearing asbestos aprons and welding goggles, sweat pouring off their faces, cranking out splatbooks to the clock.</p>
<p>Wikipedia enlightens me:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>An industry is generally any grouping of businesses that share a common method of generating profits, such as the "music industry", the "automobile industry", or the "cattle industry".</p>

                            While that's technically true, Larry, the "RPG Industry" is roughly equivalent to the "Kind of Weird People at Ren Faire who Sew Period Clothing Industry" in terms of size and professionalism.<br/><br/><em>Edit:</em> Actually, the more I think of it, they've probably got us beat in terms of size, if not in revenues.                        </div>

                            Or maybe the problem isn't product coming out too fast to process, but product too boring, or too bad to <i>want</i> to process; if every game is the same old, no wonder people will only buy so much of it.                        </div>

                            Well, it's a circular problem.  If you are on a publishing cycle that has you writing material before hearing customer feedback and seeing what your current product needs, you're shooting in the dark, and it's never quite as solid as product built on actual play needs.  (Consider the value of D&amp;D 3.0 splatbooks which were hammered out rather quickly compared to the changes made for 3.5.)<br/><br/>Generally, it seems like the publishers that stick to one major product for a given game a year tend to produce better quality overall, because there is time for the product to be better tuned towards actual play and customer response.  This is not much different than the cycle by videogame studios or musicians, so it seems like a good workable model overall.                        </div>

                            It also wouldn't hurt to expand back into geekdom. If Tenra-Banshou can get the Anime crowd in, then that's a HUGE potential crowd. Sure Joshua is right, and dinner-party crowd is bigger, but each crowd is good.<br/><br/>I'm all into trying to get the Card and Board gamers into semi-RPGs myself.                        </div>

                            Maybe the "I can't feed my starving children with my game design day job" industry is in trouble, but I can't think of any games produced by that industry that I'll particularly miss if so and so is forced to go work at Kinkos or something. <br/>

<p>Of course the business model for RPGs is being overturned; the business model for <em>everything</em> is being overturned. It's part of the networked global economy.

<i>The only thing that seems different is that this weird appeal to consumers goes out all the time that the poor, fragile "RPG industry" is liable to disintegrate, so you better do your duty or you won't have a hobby anymore. Say what?</i><br/><br/>Well, I don't even think that is unique to the RPG industry.  Look at the music industry's initial response to the illegal download question, the book industry's response to the double whammy of scanning and internet used book sales...<br/><br/><i>My favorite: Note this, fuckers: D&amp;D is "the Industy". If we had signatures here, that would be mine. Because apparently while I thought I've been gaming for half my life, I've only played the game once!</i><br/><br/>Well, if we go back to the original laws article and keep Ben Lehman's distinctions, he has a point.  He then mutilates and beats that point until it can only scream gibberish...still, the original point seems sound: the industry, defined by market shares and such, has a lot to do with WotC.  Now, that doesn't mean that we should collapse rpg play into the industry, just as it makes no sense to collapse the actual playing of music to (oh, crap, here I'll show my ignorance of music) Virgin Records or something.<br/><br/>I would just really like to see a serious, visionary response from the industry heavies to this problem, though.  I think there must be a better route than merely producing more and more 'collectibles.'  And I'm not sure that the route taken by the Indie side will work in the same way at the scale the heavies occupy--I suspect there are different pressures.  Sort of like bees vs. hawks: the bee can, due to its size, exploit much more subtle changes in the air that simply can't impact something like a hawk.<br/><br/>Still, the music industry did something really cool.  Gaming would have to re-evaluate its structure, maybe question some very basic assumptions (like the way in which people's attention navigates a text).  I really don't think that the internet has somehow corrupted our attention span, but that it has allowed us to exploit a more 'natural' application of it, one that we just haven't quite worked out how to manage appropriately.                        </div>

<p>Isbo,</p>
<p>you have a point about the music industry, but... man, comparing <em>anyone</em> involved in this hobby with record industry douchebags is just mean. (Exempting Lorainne Williams era TSR.) Also, I don't remember the music industry doing anything "really cool" since, um, compact disc, so I don't know what you're referring to there.</p>
<p>The book industry even has a coherent response to those threats? News to me. I read a neat article in the Village Voice about how the book trade is basically in the same place as RPGs, bitching about how sales are dwindling and they're just competing for the same pool of customers. But small independent presses are having a heydey now, selling modern, relevant stuff that the big publishers wouldn't touch.</p>
<p>I don't know what an "industry heavy" is. Steve Jackson Games, the company? Robin Laws, hotshot designer? More to the point, why would you <em>care</em> whether "industry heavies" solve their own problems? Why does it matter to YOU? Why's it <em>your</em> problem?</p>
<p>The RPG industry is, at this point, this odd completely tangental appendage to process of publishing and playing role-playing games. If it happens to produce something I find useful, swell.</p>
<p>Man, what a rant.</p>

No big bucks, though, and plenty are feeling the pinch.<br/><br/><i>I don't know what an "industry heavy" is.</i><br/><br/>Organizations with some financial muscle, capable of investing in experimental explorations of new formats without risking their lives on it.  <br/><br/><i>why would you care whether "industry heavies" solve their own problems?

I don't just see it as their problems, but a set of problems that a whole bunch of industries ought to strive to solve together.  If one industry, say RPG's, starts taking those steps, it would be easier for others to follow suit.<br/>3. I'm part of the book industry--it feeds me and keeps a roof over my head.  I would like to see it do better than it is, to be better than it is.<br/>4. Even in the future where I do not see myself in the book industry, I see myself in the business of education and the book industry remains a compelling force within that system.  A sea change within it is a step towards a sea change in what it means to educate, a sea change in what it means to be educated.  and maybe, just maybe, a sea change in that gets us closer to a new engagement with what it means to live in the world with other people.<br/><br/>Wheels within wheels, interlocking gears.  Yeah, that's thinking a big.  And, no, I don't think WotC re-evaluating things will change the world in and of itself.  But the discussion that leads to that, the discussion that comes out of that, the discussion that echoes beyond it, is a step on the way.                        </div>

                            I've seen "the RPG industry is dying!" being bandied about for at least ten years, maybe fifteen.  And you know something?  I don't really care.<br/>
<br/>
The <i>hobby</i> and the <i>industry</i> are two different things.  Every RPG company in the world could fold tomorrow... and I'd still have all the RPGs that are on my shelves, gaming friends, discussion forums, free RPGs on the 'net, and keep on writing my own RPG.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, there are individual games whose publishers have long-since abandoned them or gone under -- but which still have active fan communities out there.  The Fantasy Trip, AD&amp;D2, and DragonQuest spring to mind.  Others keep being reborn -- Chivalry &amp; Sorcery and Chill spring to mind there.  Heck, look at Glorantha -- abandoned by publishers for 10-odd years, then revived as Hero Wars.<br/>
<br/>
The "industry" or segments thereof may be having problems... but for me personally, it's a better time to be an RP gamer than it's ever been.                        </div>

                            Well said. <br>
<br>
I think that the Darwinian process is inevitable, but it's not hurting me in any way I can fathom. <br>
<br>
RPGs can, in fact, compete with whoever it is that's taking their market away, but not by being the same thing they've always been. As long as RPGs are rehashes of D&amp;D...do we really need more? Why should anyone buy even one more new D&amp;D module when there are enough extant to play ever Tuesday night until we're dead? I'm reading actual play reports on The Forge of people playing Module B1, which is about three decades old. I still have my copy. Wanna play? <br>
<br>
I should buy more of this crap because??? I've already got games I like to play, I don't need more of the same. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of overall marketshare RPG Pundit is right, though not in the way he thinks. Almost all RPGs are D&amp;D, effectively, in terms of whether or not somebody plays RPGs, or plays something else. That is, every RPG since D&amp;D is basically a variation on the idea that people get together at a table, create imaginary characters, and then figure out what happens to them. <br/>
<br/>
It's like the fact that to a Jazz musician, all Rock n' Roll is one song played lots of different ways. For a rock musician, it's hard to see it from this POV, there's heavy metal, and pop rock and all sorts of variations. But the differences between Sci-fi and Fantasy, or Gamism and Narrativism, pale in comparison to the differences between playing any RPG, and going to a baseball game. <br/>
<br/>
Quite simply, you can't fix a problem of people leaving RPGs for something else by making more innovative RPGs, because they're still RPGs, and will still compare precisely the same between overall consumer activities. Designers can lament about this fact, but that's not going to change anything. <br/>
<br/>
Most importantly it's not going to change the fact that I own games I want to play; games I want to play for years and years to come. If no RPG ever gets made again, as I say above, I can still go to my grave playing far more than I should. <br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>

"White Wolf, TSR et al will no longer be driving forces in the RPG industry. They will support their existing players and continue their emphasis on fiction and other non-game products.

<i>Now, the RPG industry has its version of iTunes, they call it Drivethrurpg, but because they don't want it to compete with the (rather ailing) Brick and Mortar sales, the prices are too prohibitive for what they are selling.</i><br/><br/>Well, part of the problem to my mind is that the product is just a mimic of the Brick and Mortar version.  iTunes breaks down an album into its consituent tracks and allows you to pick and choose.  If you only want the hit single, then you only buy the hit single.  If you want to branch out a little into other tracks, see if they live up to your hopes, then it only costs you a little bit more...<br/><br/>It's one of the things that certain games can actually mimic--D20, for example, with its 'hit' singles being a spell list, a prestige class, a mini-module, a rules set.  However, instead of letting you just buy the 'hit', they make you buy the whole package, with all the dross attached.<br/><br/>And, actually, it is sort of funny how accurate that 1995 quote is--given how difficult a business futurism is, it really hit a lot of key points.                        </div>

That's a pretty cool thought about "single" D20 content. Because you're right. There's always that one monster or feat or whatever printed in supplement X, but you have to pay for all the other crap to get it. Just like full-length albums.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really tempted to write some $2 D20 content right now to see how it would work.                        </div>

<br/>
I would love, love, love, a big book of feats.  With a big book of feats, a book of spells, a book of prestige classes, the core rules, and a strong web presence, WotC could probably make a small but significant chunk of change for years to come if they never did another darned thing.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sure the Spell Compendium isn't selling as much for the new spells, as much as the fact that people get tired of flipping through 4-5 different books to deal with their spells in play.<br/>
<br/>
Yes--it's why most people I knew bought it.  They should have just had the cover copy read: "Want to clean up your tabletop?  Tired of not being able to see the minis over the mound of books each spellcaster player has open?  Sick of having the game canceled because the DM gave himself a hernia lifting his bag of books?  Then buy me, buy me now."                        </div>

<p>They did this for 2nd Edition, publishing compendia of every Wizard spell ever published, every Priest spell ever published, and finally every magic item ever published. It was a cool idea, but they had a fancy book format and it was expensive to get all of these.</p>
<p>Then they went to 3rd Edition, and rebooted the supplement chain. Maybe electronic format would make this a lot more feasable.</p>
<p>But I think Wizards' current business model is predicated on the fact that their customer base <em>will</em> buy a supplement just to get the handful of material they'll ever use.</p>

                            Fight Battle? Don't make me laugh. I'm on all the industry insider lists, and I know firsthand from the rational and cooperative people there that the Fight Battle development team are talentless hacks who hire low-skill artists and writers for their books. Oh, and the worst? They don't pay them for their work! Can you believe that? They. Don't. Get. Paid.<br/><br/>Well... we at Wild Myth Studios don't pay our writers or artists either, <i>but the artists and writers <b>we</b> don't pay have <b>far</b> more industry experience and credit</i>. Oh, and when we are months late with promised payments, we are always a few months <i>less late</i> than the Fight Battle team.<br/><br/>Plus, our logo is cooler. That alone is a good sign that we will dominate the industry.<br/><br/>I mean, fuck!  A COOL LOGO PEOPLE. What else do you need?                        </div>

                            The only caveat with all of the "Fie on 'The Industry'!  What did The Industry ever do for me?!" rhetoric is that, speaking purely from the standpoint of social networks, there is a point beyond which the social cohesion of the hobby will break down, simply because there aren't enough people to create a robust network to withstand shocks.<br/><br/>Granted, there will always be *someone* playing RPGs somewhere.  Hell, there are still people performing the Commedia della Arte, after all.  But without a robust social network of some sort, the margins for publication are going to get slim to the point of insolvency.  Like it or not, the main reason that the indie movement can thrive is because people find D&amp;D and White Wolf, and through either the social network or the internet, discover the indie scene.  There might be some bleed-through from, say, the theatre or other related interests, but D&amp;D remains the gateway drug for all things RPG.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that RPGs still have a long way to go before extinction.  I'd just prefer that they remain healthy, vital, and one the radar screen.                        </div>

                            Hey, I just wanted to make a note that I thought Kuma's post there was pretty thought-provoking. I want to spawn some discussion off of it, maybe in a new thread, as soon as I figure out how to couch it in a constructive context. But I'm posting here to stop it falling into the abyss of ye olde poſts.                        </div>

                            Good save, Larry!  <br/>
<br/>
Kuma does make a very good point--one of the thing that the 'big' games provide is an access portal to the hobby, something that lots of people recognize and are capable of talking about.  "Ok, so you played D&amp;D/Exalted/Storyteller...you have probably seen this sort of thing happen...let me tell what you happens instead here, see if you can dig it."  <br/>
<br/>
There is a nice follow-up to that, too, even for those who don't play them anymore--they provide a common language for talking about gaming, too.  Even where that common language largely serves a negative function (i.e. "this game is nothing like D&amp;D, it avoids these sorts of pitfalls, it encourages this sort of play instead..."), it allows people to talk to each other in a quick shorthand.  <br/>
<br/>
When I started poking around Indie games, I did so with very clear ideas of what I didn't like in mainstream games before I had a more positive conception of what I wanted in an indie game.                        </div>

<p>Sorry, folks, I don't buy it. The best role-players I've met in recent years wouldn't touch D&amp;D with a regulation 1gp ten foot pole. Those people are the ones I want to play with, and it's an uphill battle to convince them that what we're doing isn't like mainstream games.</p>
<p>WotC, WW go under and all those people who were ignoring D&amp;D rules with their friends? They find TSoY.</p>

Because they have played it, and want something else, or something more.<br/>

It still provides vocabulary.  That's Kuma's point.                        </div>

<i>They don't want to play Primetime Adventures because it fixes D&amp;D's problems. They want to play a game like what Primetime Adventures is, but they're afraid it's like D&amp;D.</i><br/><br/>That's cool--although I find the "I never played it but..." response has more to do with stereotyping than anything else (eww, that's geeky).  My experience has been quite the opposite in how I need to get potential players--"ok, it still has these cool things that drew you to D&amp;D/WW/whatever, but it does all this cool stuff so much better..."<br/><br/>Still, it doesn't really vitiate the original point Kuma was making--namely that the large companies provide a certain organizing force on the hobby, one that serves as a feeder.  Just because there are folks now who are coming into the hobby from other sources doesn't mean that the big gateways aren't still WW and WotC.  That, minus those large attractors, the hobby is much more likely to break down into discrete cliques with a lot less interaction.<br/><br/>That isn't a foregone conclusion, of course.  There are centers (like this forum) that are quite good at providing a centering force, a place from which people can spin off and to which they can return.  However, these places don't have the capacity WotC does--so only so many folks are going to be supported through it.  Big centers die--flood to little centers, little centers overloaded, collapse.                        </div>

                            I read up on the weekend's additions to this thread and I thought to myself, "Didn't I blog about a similar subject recently?" and then I remembered that said blog post was linked at the top of this thread.  That's how awake I am on Monday morning.<br/><br/><em> the large companies provide a certain organizing force on the hobby</em><br/><br/>While this is certainly and probably even demonstrably true, I'm not certain that this "organizing force" is really beneficial to my gaming or to my game sales.  Sure, the big companies influence the gamer market -- they reinforce the fetish-value of having a big stack of books, they try to isolate their customers in little enclaves of loyal fans, they write crap and tell their consumers that the onus is on them to produce a better play experience.  Why do I want anything to do with that organizing force?                        </div>

                            Has anyone considered that the "large companies" which are producing the organizing force upon the hobby aren't the publishers, but instead the distributors?  The constant treadmill model is one they favor, more than anything else.<br/><br/>Also, in that light, you can see that the distribution agenda of constantly moving product has overshadowed the publisher's agenda of longterm market viability.                        </div>

                            Chris, that might apply to most publisher-distributor relationships, but I think White Wolf is a big exception.  That company is <em>adept</em> at marketing in ways that have left an indelible imprint in the hobby.  Whereas other companies have made products so that they can sell in an existing market, WW regularly makes products to shape their market, <em>especially</em> with an eye to isolating their customers from other brands.                        </div>

                            I haven't paid a lot of attention to WW in a while, but I wonder how to mesh what you guys are seeing with their embracing the d20 license as a means to fund their WoD reset?  It seems decidedly aimed at broadening their market base, rather than isolating it--i.e. come for our D20, stay for the Storyteller. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm unsure how that bears on Chris' description--even if they are being adept at isolating their market, that doesn't mean they are any less driven by the treadmill demands.  Where are the steps that lead from them being manipulative to them not being themselves manipulated by the distribution expectations?                        </div>

                            What Josh said above. Yes, D&amp;D did provide us with a common language. Note the use of the past tense. The big games aren't the "portal" anymore. There aren't any more new people playing D&amp;D than starting with other games these days. That's because, largely, RPGs as a whole aren't getting any new players. Hence the "aging gamer demographic" and the fact that there's not much need for new RPGs. <br/>
<br/>
If the big guys go away, this won't change the influx rate of near zero at all. And the language? Immortalized by Final Fantasy Ten. We don't have to worry about there not being a place for people to get indoctrinated about the lingo anymore. <br/>

                            Unless things have changed since the WotC marketing report that was released in 2000, there are plenty of people who pick up D&amp;D brand-new off the shelf or are otherwise invited to play - upwards of a million every year.  Most of those play for a year or less and then never pick up another RPG.  They're not looking to 'fix' their roleplaying experience at all.  Another large segment never leaves D&amp;D/d20.  The remainder are the customer base of the independents.  I'm assuming that White Wolf also gateways in a lot of people, but we have no idea how many.<br/><br/>Remove WotC and WW from the equation, and you're losing those gateways, which *are* a significant portion of the people who find indie games on the internet or at conventions.  I think that the conversion rate could be much higher - but you'd need coordination and concentration on the part of indie designers - places like IPR and DriveThru are helping in this regard, but they aren't the end-all be-all, because they are low-profile in and of themselves.                        </div>

                            There ARE new players.  Not a lot of them, but they exist.  Perhaps not as fast as we're losing them (to whatever) but when I go down to the FLGS on friday and saturday nights, there are happy screaming groups of preteens sitting around tables, with mid-teen GM's, and they're not playing computer games.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my experience is unusual.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there's a lot that writers, publishers, or distributors can do to expand the hobby.<br/>

That's in the hands of the players and the retailers.                        </div>

The numbers may have changed, but I'll eat my hat if the general pattern doesn't still hold.  D&amp;D and White Wolf remain the largest, most visible attractors to our neck of the woods for consumers.  Converting those people into our customers (and reaching out to other consumer bases) is our job.<br/><br/>I think that the indie movement would have much more success working collectively, to start - but that's a whole 'nother kettle of fish.                        </div>

If you're selling $200-400 worth of product, there's probably not room in the given customer's budget for your product and the other company's few hundred dollars as well.  (Add in the higher investment risk on the part of putting out that much stuff a year, and you can see how the competition factor increases).<br/><br/>If anything, the only major organizing forces that the mainstream companies have that remains to be developed is nationwide gaming clubs, like the RPGA or the Camarilla.

Ben &amp; I organized an apartment mini-con with a month's notice, bringing in a lot of non-Forgies.

This is quite true - but what I am suggesting is that the next step needs to be taken.  Design and publishing don't get butts in the seats - distribution, advertising and promotion do.  Right now, online presence and fulillment are all over the map - one guy uses Lulu, another's on IPR, a third is on RPGNow and the other guy just has a PayPal link on his site.<br/><br/>By working together in the later phases of the publishing chain and creating a larger presence, the indies can leverage the distribution chain.  Get PTA on Amazon.  Get Dogs into Barnes &amp; Noble.

I've said a lot on my blog about this - basically, d20 is a wash.
<blockquote>These are all good signs for a movement that didn't exist 6 years ago, without any real media push or marketing scheme- nothing other than people making and playing games and cross promoting out of goodwill and love of the hobby.</blockquote>
I agree that those are positive signs.  I'm just not sure that there are enough positives to outweigh the overall negative trend.                        </div>

<p>If by "distribution" you mean "getting books on store shelves" then I think it's only barely useful. Putting books on store shelves doesn't put dollars in my pocket directly, though it may spread word of mouth. Advertising is obviously part of promotion.</p>
<p>So, what you're saying is, promotion gets people to buy games.</p>
<p>I agree. In fact, it's dangerously close to tautology: promotion gets people to notice and therefore buy your product.</p>
<p>Both Luke  and Ron  see stores as promotion, not sales. As long as they don't <em>cost</em> them anything, they're great. It's <em>really</em> easy to get them to cost, rather than pay, though. If my games were in stores, they'd have to sell four times as many as I would by myself.</p>
<p>Amazon isn't a promotion engine. It's a sales engine. Since, as I just said, that doesn't generate money, it's not very useful.</p>
<p>IPR, on the other hand, is. I make money, they promote product. Yes, you can get it from my website. I make more money that way. Duh. That's because, if they're at my site, it's because my own promotion has done well enough to sell it (or my overseas shipping's cheaper). But if they heard about it through IPR, they'll buy it from IPR, which will get its cut for the job it did.</p>
<p>A brick and mortar has to a) return to me no less than $0 and b) get the buyer's friends to buy my game from my site or IPR.</p>
<p>I'd really, really like to know what 2005/2006 WotC numbers are. And I guess that means that I figure we have a lot of crossover sales, because I care.</p>
<p>But I can't help but think that I'm wrong.</p>

It got a lot of circulation among small publishers and it seems like exactly the sort of thing a niche gaming market would want to exploit.  It also taps into something that a lot of gamer-types have in spades: web savvy.  And if a big gaming company made itself the host for a go-to site where gamers could find their way from 'big name' to 'no name', it could benefit as those it hosted would.  People come to look, perhaps for something big, perhaps for something small, but meanwhile get exposure (guided exposure of the 'if you like this, look at this...' sort).<br/><br/>Of course, a smaller company could surely do this, too, although it loses out somewhat on not having so much of the big name draw.  Still, not bad.                        </div>

<i>I would love, love, love, a big book of feats.</i><br/>
<br/>
When I was at the GenCon "D&amp;D Sneak Previews" seminar last year, <i>Spell Compendium</i> was one of the products being announced. Someone then asked if a feat equivalent was in the works. Bill Slavicscek turned the question back on the audience: "How many of you would be interested in something like that?"<br/>
<br/>
I think pretty much every hand in the room shot up.<br/>
<br/>
Such a product will exist at some point.                        </div>

I think that <i>PTA</i> is point-man on that front.  I don't think that it's as far of as people would expect.

I don't think that RPGs as currently conceived will make that breakthrough, no.  But there's a lot more of the 'participation culture' going on web-wise (at least) these days than ever before.  Envisioning the RPG as a tool for content-creation and cultural participation instead of entertainment.  People remix songs and trailers - participate in online text-based RPGs in larger numbers than any gaming group could imagine.<br><br>Leveraging these sorts of hybrids is what the folks on Story Games are at the spearhead of.  Unlike other sorts of endeavours, RPG and game design are about heuristics and social interaction.  The so-called Web 2.0 is founded on the same principles.  There's no reason why RPG design must go the way of the dodo.                        </br></br></div>

Heh.<br><br>I just have a hard time believing that Mongoose, through the distribution chain, wouldn't have access to a lot of gamers that have never heard of <i>DitV</i>, or that those gamers who want to find a game like Dogs are going to find Vincent.  Or that if you put Dogs on the shelf at B&amp;N, that the exposure that you'd have there doesn't justify the cut in profit.<br><br>I'd almost call Vincent the Dave Sim of indie RPGs.<br/><br/>Well, without the misogyny.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>As the person responsible for the layout in the first ed, I think Letter is a fucking stupid way to take the book.</p>
<p>Being on the shelf at B&amp;N is useless. We're talking about promotion here, not sales. "Being on a shelf" does not drive sales. Maybe a passionate store owner could, but that's one in a hundred that would be into something like Dogs or indie publishing. We had a guy here in Northampton who was big on indie publishers, and carried Dogs and Under the Bed. He got a job offer at SJG and is now there because feeding a family on a bookstore is very hard (... uh, and also, it's a great job, I understand).</p>
<p>Kuma, you're making a lot of assumptions about how things work, and that they work.</p>

<i>Kuma, you're making a lot of assumptions about how things work, and that they work.</i><br/><br/>Uhm, well, about as many as any of us here are.  That is part of the fun of this conversation.  His point that broader exposure in and of itself might be good isn't a bad one--it is just more difficult to tease out the details since it requires more fine-grained analysis than we have access to at the time.  Simply saying exposure doesn't equal sales doesn't get us very far unless we can start talking about the how's and why's of exposure--clearly some exposure is absolutely, 100% necessary for sales even if it does not equal it.  Which is why this is nifty to attend to:<br/><br/><i>Also, distribution doesn't equal Barnes and Noble.</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>At this point, the big gaming company in question would have to somehow muscle the Forge out of the territory, before it could occupy it.</i><br/><br/>Well, I don't know about that--the Forge is great and all, but it has always struck me as inward directed--i.e. directed to self-publishers by self-publishers.  That is a wonderful resource, but isn't the sort of thing that I was talking about.  It's more of a think tank than a distribution hub.  <br/><br/>IPR definitely is the sort of thing I'm thinking about (in fact, had on my mind when I said 'smaller company')--and it does it well, but on a smaller scale.  The deliberate selectivity it cultivates is something small hubs absolutely, positively need.  It may, in fact, be the scale of the future--although maybe there is still room for something just a touch larger.  <br/><br/>IPR, in fact, points out some things about what makes for good exposure: when it comes with a 'seal of approval'--that this is not only out there, but out there because it is good.  B&amp;N has a lot of books, many of which are not cool.  Simply being in B&amp;N does not have good exposure.  <br/><br/>Now, being picked up by Mongoose does have some elements of good exposure--it comes with the 'Mongoose reputation for good products' seal of approval.  That sure as heck may not *not* be enough to drive enough sales to make it profitable to produce Ditv with Mongoose, but it does raise some more pointed questions.                        </div>

<i>Exposure = good, but the same sales at half the revenue = bad.</i><br/><br/>Clearly--to the extent that I keep referencing your particular case, it's largely as an exemplar that can be used to parse out broader issues.  <br/><br/>That being said, here are some questions that the little researcher in me starts churning out:<br/><br/>1.  How the heck does Mongoose come up with its figures for how well Ditv book would sell?  By reference to their own sales?  If so, they may underestimate how much Ditv would sell--it would still get all the indy exposure (and the sales following from it)  it currently gets + the exposure it would get from them.<br/>2.  If only by reference to their own sales, then there is a gray area that begins to open up--it would probably do as well as it has, plus some additional sales based on exposure.  Now, at half the revenue, it would have to effectively double sales and then some to be profitable--something that does seem (intuitively) unlikely--even if their sales are added to its current sales, it doesn't look so good.  <br/><br/>But with that in mind, though, the unattractiveness of the offer has much to do with the rampant success of Ditv rather than the inability of the industry to make meaningful offers to designers.                        </div>

<p>As for Mongoose, Vincent precisely explained the issue and why he didn't take the offer: he knows that the'd have to sell a truly enormous number of books to make money on them, doubling or even tripling his current sales. Exposure's not worth anything if it doesn't equal more money.</p>

<p>One thing Vincent didn't mention, but I will: backlash from core audience. If any one of you jokers sold your IP (and I know, that's not exactly what Mongoose was on about, but it's equivalent to me if you lose your ability to make your own decisions), I'd not buy the game. I don't think I'm the only one. To me, there's moral issues at stake.</p>

<i>The Forge booth at GenCon sold nearly $30,000 of goods last year. We didn't do that selling to ourselves.</i><br/><br/>I was talking of the online presence, not Forge booth when I mentioned distribution hubs.  I would be curious to parse out how many units that actually entailed, though.  Given how big the indie game community is, it may not be a lot more than selling to insiders and those with whom they play.  I've curtailed my purchasing of late with the aim of stocking up at GenCon what I can't get easily elsewhere--even on my not expansive income, that can be a substantial bit of change.  A few hundred of me would pretty quickly fill out that figure.<br/><br/>I think that alone is pretty cool and evidence of some serious dynamism in the hobby.<br/><br/>It also highlights what amounts to good exposure--not just seeing the game, but getting to play it, getting to play it with enthusiastic people, and so on.  One thing that doesn't translate as well to an online medium--a 'sample' of play like a 'sample' of a track.  Even if you see or hear actual play, it's not the same as playing--whereas listening to a sample of a track is listening to a track, just smaller.  An interesting challenge that someone might take up.  The threads about actual play on the Foundry are a step in this direction.<br/><br/>This is where anecdotal evidence from people from you who have worked the Forge booth would come in handy--what do people say when they approach the booth?  "Man, I've never done this sort of thing.." or "Oooh, look, it's out, I've been dying to play..."?  Is there already a Forge thread that details this sort of thing to which someone would post the link?<br/><br/><i>To me, there's moral issues at stake.</i><br/><br/>Yes!  Totally--what are they for you, Clinton?                        </div>

<p>As I said in a private message to someone else:</p>
<p>"I was worried that would get misinterpreted. I wouldn't begrudge someone that: I say go for it, and do what you like!</p>
<p>"But I wouldn't spend money on it. I firmly believe we're making art here. And art by corporations is morally repugnant to me - I won't pay for that."</p>
<p>Now, I totally overstated there - I go to movies, I buy books by mainstream publishers, I have a picture from World Market on my wall. But I don't make movies, or write novels, or paint.

Yet I feel guilty.)</p>
<hr/>
<p>On a side note, Mongoose - who I totally dig and respect in their own way, they're the best of the best of the worst, and this is just a joke - their line of "indie" games is called "Flaming Cobra." And mongeese kill cobras. If I were paranoid...</p>

<br/>
Believe me, some of us do in fact know a little tiny itty bit about what we're talking about.  This isn't just wild speculation.<br/>
<br/>
So, here, how about me.  My mom is an author and publishes through traditional publishing, which is a model rather like Mongoose is talking about, but with less work from the creator (creator keeps IP, grants publisher rights to produce a book to certain specifications -- I believe in Mongoose's case you're supposed to provide art+layout yourself.)  A hardcover book that does well but not blockbuster will, in its lifetime, sell around 10,000 copies.  My mom gets around 1.80 a copy in royalties.  (There's advances and stuff but in terms of final profit those are usually meaningless.)  The book has been out for about eight months and she's sold around 6-7k copies.  Intrepid folks can figure out her income.<br/>
<br/>
(This is leaving aside her own production costs, for the time being.)<br/>
<br/>
In the same time I've been selling Polaris.  I make around $14 on direct sales, aound $8 on sales to stores.  I've sold around 550 copies in this time, about a third to stores.<br/>
<br/>
If you calculate this out, you'll find that my mom and I have made about the same amount of money.<br/>
<br/>
To make any business deal, I want to assure myself that everyone is getting a fair deal (this isn't just altruism -- it's self protection.)  As far as I can tell, to give everyone a fair deal on publication and make as much money as I can selling by myself, I need to sell somewhere around 7-10k copies of my book per year.  No one operating presently in RPGs can promise that sort of sales on a new game title, especially a non d20 game title, nor should they.<br/>
<br/>
And that's the sales to break even.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are conditions on which I would sign up with a publishing company -- I'm not as ideological as Clinton.  Basically, if I had a deal with a company where they were a normal book publishing company interested in promoting live fiction as a new hobby, with promotion and distribution to book stores all over the country, I would be all over that like pointy ears on a fantasy race.<br/>
<br/>
But no existing RPG company [can, by definition,] be in a position to offer that.<br/>

<p>Isbo,</p>
<p>I've pointed at this many times before, but I'll do so again. The truest expression of what we're doing, and what I love about RPGs was said by Ron Edwards, a long time ago:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>When a person creates something (film, novel, RPG) that shares interest with another, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because the content Ã¢â‚¬Å“speaksÃ¢â‚¬Â to the second person. What jazzes you, jazzes me. Or, in some cases, what jazzed you in way X, jazzes me too in way Y. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ The personal commitment and personal spin brought to the creative work - the extent to which it jazzes and satisfies its own creator - is precisely what the audience member (or user, in the case of a musical instrument or an RPG) is responding to. Which is to say, the more a work expresses a personal vision, the more likely it is to appeal to its audience.</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ say what you want to say with your game. Have it play the way you want to play it. Make sure that it speaks to you, not to some group you want to please. If you publish it through the stores, yes, meet certain needs of the three-tier chain - but only those needs which benefit you as well, not any and every need they plead for.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, any RPG that can fit these ideals is fine with me; I don't care how you sell it. I do think it's exceedingly hard to make a game that fits these ideals in the traditional manner. HeroQuest and maybe Blue Rose are the only two games I can think of that I feel fit these ideals that are published traditionally.</p>

<em>I wonder if someone looking at a game in a corporate environment conceives of it as having an artistic vision--they aren't looking to prune it back to its most vibrant, most intense expression (as a good corporate editor still might for a novel) but to make it look a certain way</em><br/><br/>In a corporate environment, your number one priority is to make money.  This isn't because the corporate world is full of greedy pirates who are only out for profits.  It's because you're not working for yourself and your sensibilities; you're working for the owner of the company.  Increasingly, the "owner of the company" isn't any one person, it's a collection of shareholders, most of whom have little-to-no knowledge of the actual operation of the company.  They own shares, they invested their money into the company, they deserve a return.  To take it a step further, these shareholders are not necessarily tycoon investors who are only out for profits -- shareholders can just as easily be guys saving up for their kid's college education, pension funds trying to cover medical costs for their greying consituents, banks who turn their dividends around into the interest of their clients, some of whom are just trying to make ends meet.  The corporate world is increasingly interdependent and is made up of a whole lot of 'little guys'.  And you work for them.<br/><br/>So when you sit down at your desk, you conceive of things that can turn a profit.  Sure, if it's beautiful or clever or whatever as well, that's gravy, but profitability is the first and foremost concern, and whatever you start will be optimized for more profitability by yourself and others before it sees the light of day.  A large large portion of that is marketing (making it "look a certain way") but some other bits involve manufacture (making it cost less to produce) and financing (protecting the IP for later uses).<br/><br/>Contrast that with indie game publishing, where you do stuff cause you want to, and either accept a small loss or merely work to have a project pay for itself rather than trick it out for maximum profitability.  The end results will be quite different.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I have a sense of that big picture, but I'm curious about why it seems worse within the rpg market than, say literature.  Cool experimental authors don't need to self-publish to get their vision out there, even though the shareholders of the publishers are pretty eager for their profit.  <br/>
<br/>
When I watch what goes on at the Forge, it looks a lot like a good editorial process--not just an outpouring of inspiration, but thoughtful response to the projected product that leads to significant structural alterations.  <br/>
<br/>
Which makes me think that there is some additional factor at work in the rpg sector besides 'normal' corporate culture.  The idea that big systems like WotC and WW put out are broad enough to deal with any sort of play seems to be one thing going on, but is it just things like that?                        </div>

                            Maybe like all the big motion picture studios who have all seen how popular small, indepedant releases can be, so have opened there own art house divisions. I can't really see it happening, but wouldn't be nice for someone to get big funding from WotC?                        </div>

                            A nice topic shift has occurred here.<br/>
<br/>
I read Ron's statement (and Clinton's affirmation) with great interest. I couldn't be more in disagreement with it. When I buy a game, I am not paying for someone else's "vision", I may get one, or I may not, but if I get one, I immediately break it and throw it out, often saying something like "fuck that guy right in the ear".  What I want from games I buy are toolkits by which I can express my own vision, make my own way. I don't give a game designer any real credit for my kickass ideas, nor do they get any blame if my ideas suck. <br/>
<br/>
I agree that a designer that has a clear idea and expresses it well makes better games, but it's not the idea that matters, because fuck the idea, it usually sucks (or I do), it's the expression that counts.                        </div>

<p>I don't think JD is saying some that anyone would disagree with. If you have some designer's vision that doesn't actually interact with and become the <em>player's</em> vision, you just have boring top-down content a la uber GMNPCs, and we don't want that.</p>
<p>So Dogs has Vincent's vision of the Faith and conflict mechanics, which is cool, but it only really matters because when I play it with my friends, it becomes our own, unique imagining of the faith, and our own way that we interact with the conflict via dice.</p>

                            This is an interesting discussion.  Let me try to add something meaningful to it.<br/>
<br/>
I've never played a roleplaying game with anyone who has not played Dungeons &amp; Dragons (that I know of).  Do you think that the notion of White Wolf and D&amp;D as necessary gateway drugs is dead?  Do you think that in the future, there will be enough of an inflow of players from non-gateway sources (such as viral marketing) to make it possible for me to find a playgroup with relative ease?<br/>
<br/>
That's my biggest concern about a market collapse.  Finding other people to play with.  I don't really care what happens to WoTC and White Wolf.                        </div>

Yeah . . .  I guess you're right.  I just can't imagine actually DOING it.  My non-gamer friends are really resistant to the idea.  Getting people I don't know who don't play RPGs to play them is not something I'm thoroughly comfortable doing, either.  I don't know why.<br/>

                            Rob, my point about that is that, if we rely on D&amp;D and WW as the bigest attractions to the industry, then the industry is doomed. Kuma didn't disagree with me, he keeps saying that they're largest. Well, sure. But with these draws as largest we're still seeing a contraction of the market. I don't think that they're bringing in many people. At best, if the big guys go, it only hastens what seems to be an inevitable demise at this point. <br/>
<br/>
But, thing is...when is the last time you played a RPG with somebody you discovered at a game shop who's only previous gaming experience was D&amp;D? I don't know about any of you, but I've never had that happen. I play with people I know, who I doubt are going to flee playing RPGs any time soon. So, I dunno, maybe I'm lucky, but I'm never going to be short of players. <br/>
<br/>
Sounds to me like it's only the D&amp;D players who are going to suffer. Or whoever the hell it is who goes trolling for players at their FLGS. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of the economics of self-publishing, I can't believe that people have missed the most important part of the formula. <br/>
<br/>
First off, I think that the profit ratio is far higher than what's being bandied about here. If you look at Ben's numbers, those are more like what I'm used to. So nearly a 10 to 1 ratio of profitability. So you have to sell ten times as many books to make as much money. <br/>
<br/>
But that's going to vary somewhat depending on the deal. Let's say for argument's sake that the ration was only 2 to 1, and your publisher is promising three times the sales. You'd have to be nuts not to take it, right? <br/>
<br/>
Wrong. <br/>
<br/>
There's a finite market out there. Eventually you're going to sell to all of them. This is inevitable. So, sure, with the deal offered, I sell to my 6000 potential fans in two years instead of in 6 years. But in the long run, selling slow and steady for six years, I'm going to make twice the money when all is said and done. Even if because of lack of exposure I only get to 4000 of them, I've still made money.<br/>
<br/>
And that's with our hypothetical 2:1 ratio. If the ratio is more realistic, you're a fool to sell out. Because, yeah it might take longer, and you might miss a few people. But you're going to make way more money over the life of the product selling it at the higher profit per copy. <br/>
<br/>
I think that slower discovery of a game by the market is actually beneficial too. But that's a whole nother discussion. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, the small-scale publishing model is the one that can weather a contraction in the market, should that happen. It's the bigger publishers who feel the contraction, because they depend on volume for profitability. <br/>
<br/>
I don't think that small-scale publishing itself is going to "save" the industry by making it get bigger. As I've said, I think that RPGs are largely doomed to contract no matter what. But if there is some game that does break out of the RPG paradigm, and become something that does expand the market, I'm betting it doesn't come from the big guys. <br/>
<br/>
Was WotC big before magic (BTW, Fred, what are those kids playing at the store - a RPG)? No, magic made them big. Big enough to buy D&amp;D on a whim. Are clickies a RPG? Who were wizkids before clickies? Its the single individual with a vision for something new that creates new players in gaming. Not WotC. Not by a long shot. <br/>

                            I'm just saying that I think it's the more common experience to find kids in the FLGS to be playing Pokemon or somesuch. I don't think I'm alone in that. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that absolutely zero people are brought into RPGs these days...heck, I'm brainwashing my son to play, and I recruit people all the time. I'm saying that the amount of those who may then go on to play an indie game is vanishingly small. <br/>

                            I think that one of the most critical disconnects of the Forge and the "indie" community is that they see all games as art. <br/><br/>Sometimes pictures are just porn, music is only for dancing, and games are just entertainment. As enjoyable as they are, they are not art; you can't make them art, and applying any hypothesis that applies to art is going to produce garbage. Much the same way running a car into a piano doesn't make music.<br/><br/>As a corelary. most people don't understand "art". They may like it, or they may hate it. They can't usually describe what makes it compelling or what makes it putrid. Art historians and professors argue all day, but people still buy Rodrigue's dogs more than they by copies of Pisschrist because they think the dogs are cute. People buy games. Just people, not artists.<br/><br/>Now that is off my chest I am going to watch "Kinky Boots", I don't know if it is art, but I loves me some british drag queens!                        </div>

                            No argument, Ross.  Tag ain't art.  Nine Men's Morris is not art (although the board and pieces might be).  Scrabble isn't art.  D&amp;D is not art (although the book may be).<br/>
<br/>
But there are some games that are art -- when played they produce things of beauty and fascination.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think it's a worthwhile distinction for designers.  Am I trying for art, or is that not a part of my goals, here?                        </div>

<blockquote>I've never played a roleplaying game with anyone who has not played Dungeons &amp; Dragons (that I know of).</blockquote>
Assuming youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about people who have literally played some version of D&amp;D (and not the idea Ã¢â‚¬Å“all games are essentially D&amp;DÃ¢â‚¬Â), then yes, I have played with people who have never played D&amp;D. In fact, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve played with people who have never played RPGs before, but expressed an interest in trying them out. (Like Mike, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got my daughter playing RPGs nowÃ¢â‚¬â€specifically The Shadow of Yesterday.)
<blockquote>Do you think that the notion of White Wolf and D&amp;D as necessary gateway drugs is dead?</blockquote>
I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about as sound a statement as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Monopoly is the gateway to playing board games.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/><br/>And now, a l'il rant:<br/><br/>I think one of the biggest hindrances to RPG sales and growth is the enormous cost. Not in terms of money, but in time and sociality. From what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen, most people who design, write, produce, sell and play RPGs believe and promote the idea that RPGs arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just something you pick up and do for fun, playing RPGs is a <i>hobby</i>, a <i>lifestyle</i>, a <i>subculture</i>, an <i>identity</i>. If you play RPGs, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a Ã¢â‚¬Å“gamer,Ã¢â‚¬Â a Ã¢â‚¬Å“geekÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of us.Ã¢â‚¬Â If you want to play an RPG, you have to commit to being a gamer, to spending time with other gamers, to learning all the lingo and in-jokes, to playing regularly with a particular group. If you make derogatory comments about Ã¢â‚¬Å“gamers,Ã¢â‚¬Â youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re accused of Ã¢â‚¬Å“elitismÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“self-hateÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬â€because youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve betrayed the community.<br/><br/>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard for me to express how I really feel about that without resorting to Keith Senkowski-esque profanity, but basically, I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perverse and idiotic. There is nothing about the actual play of RPGs that requires this kind of buy-in any more than there is for board games or card games. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason why RPGs canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be something you pick up and play whenever you're in the mood with whatever friends are interested at that moment. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to post on RPGnet or the Forge or EN World, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to want to go to GenCon, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to play as many different games as you can or play the same game week after week in a continuing Ã¢â‚¬Å“campaign.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/><br/>As long as this Ã¢â‚¬Å“gamerÃ¢â‚¬Â thing continues to dominate RPGs, I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be the least surprised if sales drop, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be shocked if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s any kind of substantial growth in the sales and playing of RPGs.                        </div>

There is NO FRICKIN' WAY I show up every Friday night - I cannot make that kind of commitment to a group. And the expectation of shared life experience is up there, too - I am one of the only middle-aged-gamers-with-kids-and-job I know locally, and I get flak regularly because I'm not up for spontaneous socializing with the gang at the drop of a hat.<br/>
<br/>
My ideal gaming environment has enough social network density to arrange short-run games ad hoc, enough pick-up-game short-format RPGs to play at the coffee shop with whoever shows up that night, and a sense of gaming as a _hobby_, not a lifestyle.                        </div>

                            Yeah, the thread's a-sploding!<br/>
<br/>
The reason I buy games is, as I noted in my post, because I like toolkits. Give me some of this, give me some of that, throw that crap out the window, here, bring this other crap in the window. The old canard "but why would you buy games if you're just going to shit on all the designer's hard work like you claim you do" is a lot like asking a craftsman why he buys hammers, lumber, and even instruction books, why a cross-stitcher buys patterns, why a model train guy buys magazines, the only conceivable answer is "because it helps me do what I do when I engage in this hobby!"<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what a "Forge-derived" game is at this point, except I know Nine Worlds, Dust Devils, the Shadow of Yesterday, and Capes are Forge-derived, and I've played all those (in one-shots, not with my normal group.) And I've read a bunch more Forge-derived games and used huge bloody chunks of them in my own mainstream games, so to some degree I've "used" Dogs in the Vineyard and Sorcerer even though I've never "played" them in the sense that I sat down and played a game by all the rules and setting as directed to in the rulebook, but if I think about it, I don't think I've ever done that since I was in the 7th grade playing red box D&amp;D, and even that only lasted a couple of sessions. And I think that kind of play - where you do ALL of what the gaming book says and NOTHING else - is a lot rarer than people think. But who the hell do I think I am, the Zogby fucking Poll? It's just a guess on my part.<br/>
<br/>
As for getting non-D&amp;D, non-WW people to play, do it all the time. All the time. Here's how you do it:<br/>
<br/>
1. Don't be a freak.<br/>
2. Let people know you game - talk about it when people ask what you did last weekend, have books around, etc. Don't hide it under a bushel. The phrase "geek omerta" is one of Malcolm Sheppard's pithiest. You know what I'm talking about here.<br/>
3. Express interest in having a friend game with you. Nothing high-pressure, nothing that puts them too much in the spotlight or makes them have to come up with a ton of narration. I always use Star Wars d6, it's fast, easy to understand, the dice don't look funny, and Everyone Loves Star Wars. The reason D&amp;D's a good gateway game is because there are a lot of CONCRETE choices, same with WW and the splats. Same with Star Wars d6 and the templates. "Here, you're a spunky kid and you're a tough space pirate, let's go shoot stormtroopers." is all the setup you need for a solid two-hour session of hilarious fun.<br/>
4.  Either they will be hooked for life, or they'll have a great time and they won't really care much whether they ever game again.<br/>
<br/>
I am frankly not convinced there are all those millions of potential gamers out there "if we could but REACH them!"  But fortunately I'm not a marketer so it's not a problem I worry about.                        </div>

<blockquote>Name a social game where that isn' t true, Josh.<br/><br/>I don't think it's avoidable.</blockquote>
I've played a number of board games over the years with friends--everything from Monopoly and Risk to Scrabble and Scattergories and Trivial Pursuits to Pirate's Cove and Ticket to Ride. Never has anyone playing those games pushed me to commit to playing those games on a regular, or even semi-regular, basis. I've never even thought of the friends I play board games with as a "group" (except in the general "group of friends" sense) whereas people invariably talk about their "RPG group." Playing board games has never been seen by me or anyone I associate with as a "hobby," but just as one of the many things we might do socially. Card games--Gin Rummy, Poker, whatever drinking game I've been suckered into playing--have always been the same way. Hell, I got into Magic just before it became a crazy phenomenon, and the only reason it had any "subculture" associations was because I bought my first deck in an RPG store and one of the friends I played it with also played RPGs. But beyond that, it was (again) just one thing among many I might do socially with my friends.<br/><br/>This is true for every other social activity my friends and I engage in for fun: dinner parties, watching the Oscars, going to the movies, whatever.<br/><br/>Why do you think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unavoidable? What about playing RPGs makes it <i>unavoidably</i> a hobby and a subculture that one must commit oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time, energy and identity to?                        </div>

                            Joshua is spot on about the commitment issue.<br/><br/>The issue is that (most) rpgs are less like boardgames, and more like theatre, a band, or a sports team in terms of commitment.  It takes effort and time before you can start (learn the rules, learn the setting, make a character), you have to consistantly make meetings, which are often 4-6 hours in duration, etc.  Oh, yes, and many require additional specialized equipment- be it weird dice, mini's, maps, etc.<br/><br/>The problem is that the most well known games that people are hoping to be "gateway" games are, in fact, catering to the hardcore, which scares away a lot of folks.<br/><br/>Tying this all back into the original point of the thread- why put in extra effort for a narrowing (more hardcore) market? Consider the sheer number of threads on the Forge alone, in any given company's forum, that are dedicated solely to "un-explaining" assumptions brought over by these "gateway" games.  <br/><br/>Is it really worth the outreach to have to THEN try to explain what the Breaking the Ice is about to someone who can't fathom a game without death mechanics?                        </div>

All this "lahlah indie games are all unprofitable, creator funded art projects" is shit.  It's an absolute and total lie spoken by people who have no idea what the fuck they are talking about, and if you said as much in this thread I mean you, specifically you, yup.  I'm quite simply engaging in the most sensible business practices I possibly can right now.  And so is Vincent.  And Paul.  And Clinton (sorta.)<br/>

                            Yeah! Yeah!<br/><br/>Here's Joshua BR from the bottom of the first page:<br/><i>Contrast that with indie game publishing, where you do stuff cause you want to, and either accept a small loss or merely work to have a project pay for itself rather than trick it out for maximum profitability. The end results will be quite different.</i><br/><br/>That's an oldie but baddie. I turned Mongoose down because their offer was <i>nowhere near</i>  the money I'm making!<br/><br/>Now, I wouldn't say that I've tricked Dogs out for maximum profitability, especially if you're talking about short-term burn 'em fast profitability, but there's a world of possibilities between "barely break even" and <i>that</i>.                        </div>

                            Vincent, I take into account my own time writing, editing, laying out, and printing into my cost estimates.  "Pay for itself" means the book pays me sometime reasonable for writing it.  You've made a couple grand for writing, producing, and promoting a successful game?  That sounds like breaking even to my mind.  I'm not denigrating that at all; I'm just contrasting it with a process wholly devoted to generating profits.                        </div>

Hey did you know that baboons regulate their society by stressing each other out? Baboons all die of heart attacks because they regulate their society by stressing each other out. Bonobos regulate their society with sex, baboons regulate their society with stress. Sad for baboons, huh? Also I have no idea if it's true, but I heard it somewhere and it sounds good.                        </div>

How common is Vince's experience?  How profitable IS it, in terms of money for time, to write an indie game and sell it?                        </div>

                            I respect Vincent a lot, but he's an outlier, statistically speaking.  Along with Luke and Clinton and Ron and John and Jared.  For every success story, there's a whole lot of failures.  Not that Vincent put the same amount of work into his games as Joe Nobody, but that, prima facie, indie game publishing is not something to get into for the money.                        </div>

                            Let me propose that there's a particular process we can talk about, in addition to looking at self publishing at large; let's call it the Forge process. It goes like this: design a game based on the big model, playtest it and get the input of the Forge, design it as a book for POD, sell it at least one year out of the Forge Booth at GenCon.<br/><br/>Of that much smaller set of games, I suggest that Dogs is successful, but not like <i>crazy</i> successful. I also suggest that the number of games that haven't been profitable at all is smaller than the number that've been seriously profitable - that the bell curve centers solidly on profitable.<br/><br/>I have done no research to back this up, even though I could have, and I'll admit up front that I might be wrong. But my strong impression is that you can follow that process reasonably expecting to make money at rpg design.                        </div>

                            From my observations through IPR, I would agree with Vincent's assessment. Additionally, publishing multiple high quality games increases your chances of making money, because newer titles will help sell old ones. Indie games have a long shelf life, and each new game a designer produces helps boost his or her reputation and gets newer customers to check out older games.                        </div>

<p>Oh, for want of Marginalia.</p>
<p>You heard that from me, Vincent. I wish I could remember where I'd read it. Desmond Morris, maybe?</p>
<p>Under the Bed has so far paid me about $0.48 a word. It's a tiny, black and white game about child endangerment with no illustrations whatsoever. It's firmly in the realm of the unmarketable. It's gotten me recognition, encouragement, and money. I learned from it lessons that I'm applying to Shock: and will further apply to future games.</p>
<p>None of that other stuff would be worth it if it didn't pay me.</p>

                            I've paid myself around 20c a word for Polaris, which is twice as much as I'd make selling short stories to magazines and approaching the amount I'd make from a somewhat successful novel.<br/><br/>Are there failures?
