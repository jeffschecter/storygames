Possibly. Anyway,<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have the sixth version of this project <b>Fabricated</b>, which you can find <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://wishray.com/f6/" rel="nofollow">here</a> (and hopefully the first with a full playtest PDF available online shortly), and one of the two things holding me up is making Lucy and Tom work right.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short the world of the players as unit (robot/AI) is split in two, most higher functions like research, design, and unit services have been taken over by a process in the system known as Lucy. The remaining legacy functions, such as maintenance and cleaning have been passed to a process known as Tom. In this dual world, Lucy and Tom don't always agree. When they disagree they have to get the units to resolve the dispute for them, usually smacking down the minions of Tom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlright, the thing is, I want to set up the game like so: One player has their unit in control mode for each session, like acting as the GM. This control mode unit actually acts as the voice of Lucy, and for game purposes that player controls her. The rules themselves as a system determine the actions of Tom. In this way the GM player at the moment interacts with the system to generate a situation that the other active units can deal with (or not) as they see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe questions is what kind of systems and technique have you seen in games that worked, and which ones failed. The recent post on Gorkamorka has spurred me to start this discussion, since its rules for the Dok are just want I'm talking about, though there seems to be little choice or interaction involved there. Also, obviously the encounter table is a simple form of this, so unless it does something special I don't need to here about them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
