Maybe I should have started the game at the haunted house but that's a whole other skill.  Players are sitting around in town chatting about this haunted house - they've just inherited it but the place is run down and hasn't been kept up for years.  The owner died mysteriously.<br/><br/>The players decide that they should bring along a lot of tools and safety equipment (hard-hats and such) because it's a run-down building and there's probably something wrong with it.  Now, the scenario is designed for lots of room to room back and forth 7th guest / Myst type stuff and the GM doesn't want them bashing down walls.  So he says "You don't have enough money."  or "The hardware store is closed."  <br/><br/>OR EVEN WORSE <br/><br/>He lets them buy the stuff but then throughout the game whenever they try to use it he gives it severely gimped mechanical properties when it comes to conflict.  "Sure, it's kind of head protection but it's not improving your AC."  or every smart idea by the players "we're boarding up those doors" is met with frustration "the wood is all rotten and when you nail into the wall you can just pull it out."  Because this is a puzzle scenario and you're going to solve the puzzles, damnit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128597/#Comment_128597" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:00:40+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:00AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a player side, too.  My buddy Remi C was this UBER troll hunter in an old game.  We used 2d6 roll high for resolution and it was very episodic (with me GMing a heavy spotlight on a given character per session).  One of our other friends, Derek, showed up and was along for the ride in the game.  NOw this was a character Remi had been building for about 20 sessions, and he was on this massive troll hunt that was probably going to make him the greatest troll hunter of the century.  <br/><br/>Derek just KEPT rolling boxcars.  All night.  They got through the scenario and Remi had a few cool moments, but all night I was worried that Derek was stealing Remi's story.  But Remi was so cool with it that it ended up turning out awesome.  In the end it was Remi who bestowed on Derek's character the honor of being a troll hunter even though he was an outlander.  This made it even easier for me to take the next natural step and promote Remi to the head of the order (the former head bit the big one on the hunt).  <br/><br/>That's probably Remi's best quality as a gamer - the way he's cool with stepping back and giving the awesome to someone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128600/#Comment_128600" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:03:52+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So about a month ago Mo and I are playing a TSOY game in the 7th Sea setting. She is going on about how she's trying to find this spy. I'm sitting there looking at my relationship map and going "The hell? There is no spy? Where is this coming from?"<br/><br/>Mo finally gets to the point where she just goes "Okay, I'm rolling my clandestinity, I want to find the spy." She rolls, and I'm still thinking "There is no spy, why the fuck are we rolling?"<br/><br/>I almost say "No spy, no roll." I don't. I say "Um, okay, you're resisted by an average skill." We roll, she wins. <br/><br/>She finds the spy. Who, as it turns out, is her husband. Who is working for the bad guy because he owes him money. <br/><br/>Ouch. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Example 2. <br/><br/>We're playing Dogs. Mo says, "I want to find proof that she cheated on him." She reaches for dice. <br/><br/>I say, "She didn't cheat on him. But if you want "FIND" "PROOF" you can totally frame it up or convince yourself she did."<br/><br/>Mo says, "Oh. No, I didn't want that. She didn't cheat?"<br/><br/>I say "No."<br/><br/>Mo "I'm going to kill that liar."<br/><br/>Ouch. <br/><br/>****<br/><br/>Thing about it is in both of these cases Mo or I had to give up some ownership. In the first case I became willing to let the spy in. In the second case she was willing to let the world remain as it was. <br/><br/>So for me I think its less a matter of "the GM needs to give it up" and more a matter of "a game is a negotiation, don't think you always need to win."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128608/#Comment_128608" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:13:26+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:13AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>The only AP example I have that maybe comes close but maybe not is when Storn's PC and maybe Jim's were at a murder scene in our Cold City game.

A lot of times it's just a simple throwaway comment by a GM in a game where what the GM says is given a lot of weight by the rules.  For whatever reason, a high-status or high-charisma player grabs onto it and promotes it to the rest of the group as a crucial part of the situation.  It can be a very touchy situation or it can be comedic.  I don't want to be a blocking asshole and say "Hey, you know that thing you're really totally invested in? Well, fuck you, it doesn't even exist."  But on the other hand the rules give what I, the GM, say, great weight and one reason we all selected this game is because I wanted what I said to have great weight, so by obsessing over the "magic cow" (KODT fans know what I'm talking about here), they're actually blocking <i>me</i> a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128609/#Comment_128609" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:16:38+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:16AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>So for me I think its less a matter of "the GM needs to give it up" and more a matter of "a game is a negotiation, don't think you always need to win."</blockquote>\nIn our Burning Empires game the other night, I asked a player who wanted to roll to find a spy that he believed his brother had planted in his ranks, "Would you be ok, if you succeed at the roll, if there's no spy and you're certain of it?"

That is to say, in Sorcerer you can make a character, think the character is going to be a good guy, and have the game turn him into a dick despite you. Or, make a monster and have him turn out human despite you. (How absolutely this happens is much up to debate -- but I think there really is a thing where Sorcerer, played hard to rule, makes character come out of something other than just what the player thinks about their own character.) <br/><br/>Is that another thing here? Like, GM give up sole ownership of what happens to the world, player give us sole ownership of what happens to your character? Or inside your character?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128625/#Comment_128625" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:45:47+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, where the game takes you and whether or not you like it is a whole other skill, like maybe "choose a game that fits what you want"<br/><br/>But everybody has to relax the grasp and understand they don't have sole ownership over anything.

That is pretty much the complain about railroading. There is not much freedom, and the GM isn't allowing anything he didn't devised to happen.<br/><br/>On the other hand, we have PCs obsessed with things that do not exist (I have had several Magical Cow experiences myself). They invest hours searching for something that does not exist, that wasn't there in the first place, and that they simply assumed was there. Searching for a nonexistant secret door simply means they didn't find one. It is not like saying "there is not" or "there is". It is "you didn't find any". They can't find what is not there...<br/><br/>Of course, in a Story Game there is more chance for allowing them to decide <b>if</b> there ever is something or not... As long as they don't use it as an excuse to get some Character advantage (the idea is to narrate a good story, not to get better stuff for the character).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
