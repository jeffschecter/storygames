So here's this thing that happened.<br/><br/>My character is reading The King In Yellow*. We've found a copy, in a weird alternate-reality cave, and I'm reading it because I want Mythos knowledge.<br/><br/>Another character, reasonably, decides I shouldn't read it. To ensure this, he shoots the book. This means he shoots me. He rolls maximum damage and I'm out of the game.<br/><br/>I was really pissed off about this.<br/><br/>So, look, here's the thing. It's not the fact he shot me. But it's the way it was handled at the table: the guy's comments were addressed entirely to the GM. <br/><br/>Perhaps I'm used to a different style of play, but here's how I expect the conversation to go.<br/><br/><i>Player: So, if you do that, I'm going to shoot you.<br/>Me: Well, I'm doing it.<br/>Player: Right, I shoot you. [Rolls damage] Fuck, 10.<br/>Me: Bloody hell, I'm dead.<br/>Player: Oh fuck.<br/>Me: No, fair enough.</i><br/><br/>Or perhaps not even that. Perhaps he doesn't give me the option, but at least he talks to me.<br/><br/><i>Me: So I read the book.<br/>Player: OK, look, I'd just shoot the book, and if that means I shoot you...<br/>Me: Fair enough.<br/>Player: So... [Rolls damage] Fuck, 10.<br/>Me: Bloody hell, I'm dead.</i><br/><br/>You know what I mean? Perhaps it's because I'm used to indie games, but I expect some talk around the table if I'm about to be knocked out of the game. But, man. Some guy gets trigger-happy and I'm out, without anything I can do about it. It still rankles.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>* Note to non-Cthulhu people.

The guy rolled damage. I said "Well, I'm dead". The Keeper, to his massive credit, kicks straight in with a dream-like epilogue scene for me, softening the blow and giving the character a good ending. After that, we cut back to the other characters.<br/><br/>So, story-wise, it was satisfying. Group-wise, there was no way I could say "Listen, that epilogue was great, but let's pause the game while I talk about that guy's communication style". So I kept quiet, which I think was the right thing to do. But it was strange and irritating, which is why I'm posting about it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233374/#Comment_233374" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T05:09:20+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  5:09AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a convention game, near the end, and I too was playing.<br/>\nMy character had said over a walkie-talkie "Don't let anyone read the script".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, one PC is about to press the button marked "Summon Nyarlathotep and ensure the destruction of humanity". <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's pretty obvious the other characters have to stop that happening. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, a little out of game chat is still appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nP1: I'm pressing the button.<br/>\nP2: (Out of game) You do realise if you do that, my character will have to shoot you in the head?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen either:<br/>\nP1: Yes<br/>\nP2: I shoot him in the head.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr:<br/>\nP1: Oh.

But, the team leader ordered your PC to put it down, and he didn't. Your character also heard my character over the walkie-talkie saying that under no cirumcstances should anyone read the script.

I think the character was totally justified in shooting the other one and it's a cool way to go. If you're used to the DG game, then you wouldn't be surprised if this happened, nor would you expect any OOC discussion. It's a "shit happens" kind of place.<br/><br/>So, for example, if you go exploring and find a big hole in the ground, and you say "I jump down the hole", and you're playing DG at a con and the GM says "roll jump for half damage, you make it? That's 10d6/2 damage. You're dead", don't be surprised. A kinder GM might say, "as you approach you kick a small pebble over the edge and by the time you get to the edge, it's still falling. Do you still want to jump?"<br/><br/>The last time I played DG at a con, one of the other PCs went mad and started lobbing grenades thinking everyone was a Mythos creature. I dropped back to shoot him but missed and he killed my PC with a lucky critical shot. And so it goes.<br/><br/>I guess it's a question of genre and game expectations as mentioned previously, so I'll fully expect a bullet in the brain next time we play Toon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233411/#Comment_233411" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T08:06:00+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  8:06AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a dick move to me.<br/><br/>Grappling is a better option from a social angle.

I played a ton of DG, with the grimness knob turned pretty high, but we always went for grim choices rather than naked PvP violence. How that would have played out at our table:<br/>Graham: I go to read the book.<br/>Shooter player: "I can't let you do that." I draw my pistol and push it against your temple. "Put the book down." I have a base 75%, so at point blank...<br/>Me (GM): You can't miss at that range. Graham?<br/><br/>But we got to that knife-edge teetering style through lots of playing together and negotiating. At a con you never know whether you're playing with fans of character-blender CoC or pulp adventures or "in the grim darkness of the mythos". Now that we're getting a different perspective from that table, it looks like a case of clashing expectations.
