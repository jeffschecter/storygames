Some player shows up with a risky throw that he likes.  He uses it in a scrimmage and it works once.  He throws it, his receiver catches it, I think about yelling "Freeze!"* but don't, and then the receiver throws a score.  Everyone on the offensive team is psyched.  The new guy made a spectacular throw, and the team scored.  Fun!<br/><br/>This is why I tend not to yell "Freeze!" and lecture the guy on his risky throw.<br/><br/>A few points later, he throws it again, and it's a turnover.  I say something to him: "Dude, that's a really risky throw."  He rolls his eyes and responds, "I've got that throw.  Didn't you see it earlier?"<br/><br/>Maybe I have the authority to shout him down.  "I know the system we're running, I've done it, I've seen what works and doesn't.  In the long run, that throw does more harm than good."  Or maybe I don't.<br/><br/>Now back to the RPG gaming table: we've got a rulebook written by someone we respect.  That person has run their game a lot, and written the rules <b>or play procedures</b> based on what works and doesn't work in play.  The book tells us to speak only in character, in the past tense, or some other rule <b>or methods</b> that short-circuits what we're used to.  We think, "Sure, we'll try it," because we are open-minded and fearless.  But then someone says something out of character, in the present tense, and what they say is awesome and fun.  Does anyone shout that guy down?  Do we dare ruin the fun of the moment to see what this game's big picture is all about?<br/><br/>*this is not part of the sport, just something instructors do at practices<br/><br/>Edited to add: bolded parts, in response to Jesse's distinction about rules                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259719/#Comment_259719" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T14:39:45+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  2:39PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one will be surprised by my resounding "YES, PLAY THE GAME AS WRITTEN ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS CHANGING YOUR BEHAVIOR."<br/>\n<br/>\nChanging your behavior for a game can only make you a better person.

Now, <i>perhaps</i> that's crucial to the specific game. More likely, though, it just describes how the designer likes to play.

It's expressed as a crucial rule, but it's really not.<br/><br/>So, it seems to me, sometimes designers <i>think</i> things are crucial, but actually they aren't.

Think about the rules, especially the ones that don't seem to make sense -- what possible purpose might those rules serve?  Are there any games in your experience with similar rules, and if so, what did you think of them when you followed or didn't follow them then?  Discuss it with your friends -- what do they think about it?  What do the faceless hordes on the internet think about it?  Find someone who thinks the game is awesome -- what can they tell you about this rule?  How about the people who think that rule sucks -- did they change it, and how did it work out for them?<br/><br/>Or, alternately, just try it.  If something goes wrong, big fuckin' deal.  You've got plenty of other games you can play, or you can try again, or you can go through the whole think-discuss-research thing above to decide whether you want to try it again (and what might have gone wrong).  Failure is cheap and easy -- there's no reason to fear it.\n<blockquote>As designers, how can we help players overcome these obstacles?</blockquote>If you have a critically important rule, identify it as such and explain why it's so important.  Explain it a few different ways, if you can.  Make sure that the proper use of it is illustrated in your play examples.  If possible, consider showing a "bad" play example to demonstrate why modifying or ignoring that rule ruins the game.  If you notice a lot of people getting it "wrong," consider rewriting things to make it more clear, either as an errata, a helpful FAQ, or as another version.  (And if you notice a lot of people getting it "wrong" and still having fun, rethink just how critically important that rule really is.)<br/><br/>Or, alternately, just put the game out there and let people do what they want with it.  If it's being played "wrong," big fuckin' deal.  You've got plenty of other ideas you can work on, or you can try to design a game that more directly addresses what you wanted people to get out of the game, or you can go through the whole rewrite-errata-rethink process above to decide whether there's actually anything wrong at all.  Failure is less cheap, perhaps, but just as easy -- and you should've known that releasing your game to other people meant that it now belonged to them, not you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259762/#Comment_259762" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T16:32:00+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  4:32PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2010 5:04AM by jenskot.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>If a rule goes against what people are used to or seems like a guideline but is actually a crucial rule, it needs extra emphasis.<br/><br/>Point out the rule 3-7 times in your text, say why it is important, give it a heading, maybe even a chapter, give examples, point out why the rule was so important in those examples, show what happens when you don't follow the rule, and feature it somehow on the character sheet or a player handout.</blockquote>\nSomeone asked me to expand on the above. I have to run in a few minutes but I will do my best. <br/><br/>People's attention spans are shrinking as we have more things distracting us and less time to do everything. And as we spend more time online, we begin reading books the way we read web pages. <br/><br/>Of course when I say "people" and "we", I don't mean everyone. Hell, what I'm about to write might not apply to most of the people reading this post. But it does apply to a whole lot of people who are going to read your games. <br/><br/>Keeping that in mind, the following ideas tend to be infuriating for people but none the less people who design around them are more likely to communicate their ideas effectively. But enough with disclaimers!<br/><br/><b>&gt; People don't read....</b><br/><br/>They scan. We skim text looking for words or phrases that catch our eyes. And the longer the text the more we scan. We are in a hurry and often assume we don't have to read everything anyway or that there will be a summary at the end. Scanning is how we find what we think we care about. But that means there is a lot of text we never even read. People will write instructions like it's great literature but users will read it like it's a billboard they are passing by going 60 miles per hour.<br/><br/><b>&gt; People ignore what they don't know...</b><br/><br/>We focus on words and phrases that seem to match what we are already looking for or that match our current personal interests. Have you ever noticed that after you learn a new word you hear it more often? It's always been there but your mind flagged it as not relevant since you had no reason to pay attention before. <br/><br/><b>&gt; People don't make optimal choices...</b><br/><br/>We don't choose or search for the best option. We choose the first reasonable option. We quickly run through a mental test for obvious problems and just run with it. Usually there isn't a big penalty for doing things incorrectly. It might be inefficient and less valuable for us in the long run but weighing option may not improve our chances of getting what we want. So we go with the path of least resistance first. Plus people love guessing. It's more fun and less work than weighing options. <br/><br/><b>&gt; People don't spend time figuring out how things work...</b><br/><br/>We use things all the time without understanding how they work and often with completely wrong ideas about how they work. This is true from software to games to house hold appliances. Very few people fully read instructions, if at all. That's one of the reasons character sheets are sometimes more important than game text. We will often look at character sheets first and make assumption of what's in the game text itself. We use tools in ways the designers never intended. The classic example is people typing <a href="http://www.story-games.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com</a> into a google search. People don't care if they understand how things work till its obvious that something is not working. Which is why it's sometimes useful (not always recommended) to make something break if it isn't used in the way it's intended. And when we find something that we think works, we tend to stick with it. We might use a better way if one comes to us, but we rarely look for one.<br/><br/><b>&gt; Gaming with Garbage Men?</b><br/><br/>A lot of this is related to issues I've seen in Usability Testing that I referenced in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11593" rel="nofollow">Gaming with garbage men...</a><br/><br/><b>&gt; There are lots of solutions!</b><br/><br/>But first we have to accept or at least consider the above.

So if your game has a feedback cycle that is supposed to punish sub-optimal choices over time (and/or reward optimal choices -- its similar in this regard) be prepared for the fact that a lot of people won't change their style because it won't occur to them that they should if you don't point it out and lay it out for them clearly. (And some even then.)  <br/><br/>I saw this a lot when D&amp;D 4th came out. Folks would routinely blast off a daily power without using proper teamwork and setup to maximize bonuses before they used it. They'd miss, they'd bitch. Then they'd do it again. And again. And again. When they got tired of it they usually quit playing the game. This despite the fact that some of them were told to make sure to do setup before dropping a daily. A few of them listened to it, several didn't. Of those who didn't many thought that if it was true, it should have been in the book. <br/><br/>Some folks respond to systemic logic and figure it out over time. ("Oh, if I let the Warlord bump me up, them bump him up, then he drops his daily and then I drop mine, I increase my chances of hitting by 45%!) But a lot of us don't. And won't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259765/#Comment_259765" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T16:57:01+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  4:57PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play is for fun most of the time, so most of the time you should have fun and not worry about what the designer said, their ideas are bad.<br/><br/>But if you are playing for another reason than fun, follow that reason:<br/><br/>- If you are playing to try out something new, think whether you have tried it out enough yet.

I don't design games, I don't playtest games, I am rarely asked to play a game I am not excited about. If I play a game, it's purely for my own satisfaction.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean I want to always throw out rules that slow me down and make the game less fun. Look at games like Burning Wheel or D&amp;D 4E. These are not easy games. There's lots of rules in there that are hard to learn, and slow down my play, and make the game less fun.<br/><br/>HOWEVER ... lots of people love those hard rules, and get some fun when they master them. So when I take the time to learn those rules, and get past what makes them not-fun, it can actually increase my fun later. <br/><br/>I will defer some fun now in order to have more total fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259781/#Comment_259781" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T18:41:42+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  6:41PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing a game "right" is not easy. Not in RPG-dom where we are trained to disregard rules all the time. To be able to play different games you first have to dis-learn that behavior.<br/><br/>When I try a new game, usually the first time it doesn't work well. So I read the game manual AGAIN, and I usually discover that I missed a lot of essential rules (for all the reasons outlined by jenskot above). This second time, having played it, I usually understand the book much better, too.<br/><br/>Even after the second time, I usually read the book again. There is always something I missed the first two times. <br/><br/>This if reading again the book show me that it was my fault the first time. If I don't understand the rules better the second time, I usually just drop it and play something different...<br/><br/>Anyway, what I wanted to say was this: read again the game manuals you think you know well.
