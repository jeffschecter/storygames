The SYWA con is the largest gathering of SYW miniatures players in North America and features some of the best miniatures out there for beauty of figures and kick ass terrain. Game range from the 1690's era to the 1780's and range the whole planet. I tend to do games set in or on the fringes of the Islamic world being the token Muslim of the group.<br/><br/>This years game was set on the border between Austria and the Ottoman Empire. A detachment of Austrian infantry and a few cavalry scouts, led by Captain von Fritz was charged to go to a small village to round up deserters. The village sits right on the border (a river) and though technically inside Austria it is populated by Bosnian Muslims, who have regular concourse with their kin across the bridge.<br/><br/>I had six players (including myself) play, all old and experienced gamers, most of whom have played my games before. They know my stuff is weird compared to most wargames, more talk that rules heavy.<br/><br/>I run Matrix games so the first step of any game is to introduce the players to the matrix of the world. I did this in a series of steps. First I laid out the terrain board - three 2x2 foot green boards. The first board has a hill, lots of woods, shepherds and flocks of sheep, and a Turkish looking horseman riding the edge of one of the woods. The Austian column was marching up the hill with cavalry vedettes out of their four corners. The next board had a river through the middle of it, a small village of half timbered building, a bridge across he river, more woods on either side of the river, more shepherds and flocks of sheep, a herd of cattle, women, children and a deserter in the village, a mounted Imam (islamic cleric) in the village, and people coming and going across the bridge, on the Turkish side of the border were two ornate columns that looked very arabresque just so you would know you had entered the Orient. The has board was flat and green largely covered in forrest with an old fort where the local Bosnian border guards were posted, along with an antique looking cannon. The players looks at this visual and automatically have good idea of how this world works. <br/><br/>I told the players the scenario, the next piece of the matrix. They now know that they have a mission. Next I told them that technically they are all playing von Fritz because he is who the story is about but that they also champion another force on the board. One player championed von Fritz himself, another took the Austrian sergeant, another the Bosnian border guards, another the mounted Turkish gentlemen, another the deserters, and I took the civilians. Now the players all have roles, filling in still more of th matrix. They have self interest.<br/><br/>I tell them that they cannot kill von Fritz but they can kill any other characters on the board. Von Fritz they make suffer.<br/><br/>The last piece of the matrix comes from picking a secondary goal to work on.  Von Fritz picked keeping the peace on the border - he was to try and make good things happen for the Captain. The sergeant wanted to duel a certain Turkish gentleman and also wanted good things to happen. The Turkish horseman wanted to visit his girlfriend and make good things happen. The deserters wanted to despoil local virgins and make bad things happen for the captain. The Bosnian guards wanted to ambush the Austrians and make bad things happen for the captain. The villagers wanted someone to cross the border and make bad things happen for th captain. <br/><br/>So the matrix of the world is in short: 18th Century Eastern Europe, small scale action, Oriental, overt mission to round up deserters, self interest due to role, secondary goals that clash, and an over all directive to make the captain's live easy or hard. <br/><br/>The I handed each player a stack of gold coins. Winning and losing in the game is determined by coins rather than by what happens to the characters on the board. As players did stuff, if someone did something you liked you gave them one of your coins. At the end of the game you added up the coins you had been given and subtracted the coins you didn't give out. The player with the most coins left won.<br/><br/>They now have a complete vission of the world and are ready to play. <br/><br/>I told them that after each turn they could move (1 cubit for horse, 1 hand span for people on foot, 1 finger length for the cannon.) The game started with a player pointing to a spot on the board and saying what happens there. It automatically happens unless another player jumps in and challenges it. If they do they say what happens instead, the two players then roll dice, the high roller wins. Then next player around th table then adds to the scene or points somewhere else and starts a new scene. A turn consists of one player making an addition so people could be moving all the time. As the game played, players jumped in out of order to make stuff happen. I ran with this because the point was to capture people's energy rather than to be procedural. With that I pointed to a Austrian horseman and a shephard and started the game.<br/><br/>The Austrian column moved up and shot a sheep, driving off the now disgruntled shepherd. The column then moved forward, driving more civilians off with cavalry. Austrian stragglers were picked off by some clever ambushes by civilians and a detachment of Turkish cavalry (there were lots of figures not on the board at the start of the game that could appear anywhere). The deserters were spread out despoiling virgins but were largely unarmed. One Turk horseman ran off with his girl to the woods on the far side of the river. When the locals realized that the Austrians were coming they tried to run their animals across the river but only managed to create a traffic jam on the bridge. The Austrians split their column to face off the Turkish horse and to go to the village. The village column entered town and caught one deserter. The sergeant did fight a duel and lost. Villagers did pelt them with stones, but the real action was when the Bosian guards showed up in ambush in the village. Some Austrians went down, other fled (Captain von Fritz and the deserters) and the wounded sergeant was captured. The Austrians then pulled back and the game wound down.<br/><br/>The end result was the that Captain von Fritz wrote a make up report of the encounter so that he would not look bad. The village was left waiting for the eventual reprisal. Peace on the border was maintained and the sergeant returned some years later to write a largely fictitious book about his adventures in the East.<br/><br/>Action in the game went fast. Play moved from event to event cleanly with few breaks. Movement happened when people wanted it to but it was not the main focus of play. Players objected to one another pretty often. Coins were passed whenever  people did gonzo things and at the end of the game the Bosnian player emerged as the winner.<br/><br/>It was a great game and I will certainly do it again. I'm thinking next year I will run a village game set in Iran during the reign of Nadir Shah next year.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371138/#Comment_371138" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T07:21:59+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  7:21AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

It work wonderfully! The only dice rolls where when people challenged and they wanted to the flow of play broken then. Outsiders described the players and "enthusiastic".<br/><br/>Unfortunately I didn't take any pictures (DUH!) but others did. The terrain board was nothing really new. It was as I described it above. Movement was something that I occasionally prompted but players did it on their own for the most part. Since movement happened after each turn, players could legally move pretty much any time someone was not talking. Movementwise the game was not thrilling. The Austrians moved up. Civilians fled, "Bandits" attacked and killed some stragglers, and ambushing Bosnians appeared in houses in the village. Then there was an Austrian retreat. The fun was the stuff people made up that was not movement. <br/><br/>The victory point system worked pretty well. Only one player did not give out all his coins. He had fun playing though so that went well. I came out scoring low because I paid more attention to keeping the game moving than coming up with cool ideas. Of course that is the role of a game master (I think). They shouldn't win but should instead make certain everyone else has a good time.<br/><br/>What I didn't do in this game was have anything like a lot of rules. The full rules could be tweeted. In recent years I've been writing more complete EMG rules which really didn't seem to catch on. Now I'm thinking of focusing on facebook games so real simple rules is a must. I just did one earlier in the week - and Occupy game. The question was "What do we occupy next?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371191/#Comment_371191" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T11:34:40+00:00" title="April  4, 2012 11:34AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like the more you play, the simpler you make the rules, which (to me) sounds excellent! However, I imagine there's a lot of things people will pick up on when you play with/facilitate for them. Play is often made up of all the little things, like...<br/>- How much can you say happens in one turn?<br/>- What sort of actions are within the scope of the game?<br/>- What's the tone of the game, in the fiction? <br/>- What's the tone between players? A "challenge" in one game can be a fierce one-on-one battle of wills with a lot of tension, in another game just a die roll for laughs.<br/><br/>I'd love to play one of these games with you sometime, Chris, although it's not likely to happen.

I'm wondering if you ever played around with any concepts like the old "variable length bounds" concept that Paddy Griffith worked on in his games, or what I'm tempted to just call "Movement at the Rate of Drama".<br/><br/>You know, basically just loosey-goosey movement, not really tactical until, well, itt slows down and becomes tactical.<br/><br/>Did players do stuff like that themselves? I know wheni've tried somestuff in this vein, players seem to start doing this kind of thing anyway, just sorta manuevering the toys a little bit as they felt like, provided no one else objected. Or, alternately, the toys could be moved around a great deal and re-started in a different position on the table, provided there was some sort of fictional context for it, like we were jumping ahead in time and zooming to a new period of interest/place of interest.\n<blockquote>The fun was the stuff people made up that was not movement.</blockquote>\nDo you have some examples of that, whether or not it invovled official mechanics? Like what sorts of characterizaton of characters or added in plot stuff did players come up with that you didn't already have in mind?<br/><br/>Did players conspire at all, perhaps even against a character/faction that they were championing, share out of character concepts, or even just work through a combat or conflict collectively without resorting to dice (or only to a small extent)?\n<blockquote> I came out scoring low because I paid more attention to keeping the game moving than coming up with cool ideas.

They did not happen every turn or really even that often. They came up when figures came together and first interacted. I primed the pump for players to do this when the first meeting occurred. After that they came up when people didn't agree. That was when the character they championed was on the line and when fights came up. <br/><br/>When the story moved to a climax there were a couple of times when a player challenged and then another player tried to jump in and challenge that. I had to slow them down there and roll for the first challenge first. Sometimes that settled the second challenge without a roll. At other times people challenged challenges. Most of the players were essentially familiar with Matrix games so that wasn't a problem.<br/><br/>The one problem that did come up was when one player's character got the royal screw. He was a little miffed but I stepped in and made an action that said - No he's not dead, he was captured. Others agreed so the screw job was ended.<br/><br/>As game host I was watching for people getting too miffed. A little annoyance is fun, too much is not. I would pull in the reigns on the too much by making up additions that mitigated things. <br/><br/>Movement<br/><br/>I know about variable length turns and have used them but not here. I wanted there to be some restraints on movement. When you can move anywhere movement looses all tension, and a little tension is fun. If players wanted they could have been moving pretty constantly. They moved a lot less than they were allowed so I assumed they were moving when they found it functional and useful to do so. I really tried to stay out of controlling that.<br/><br/>I would occasionally prompt them to move just to keep the idea in mind. That was me as host reminding them of another fun thing in games - movement.<br/><br/>Action in place<br/><br/>One of the players had as a goal to fight a duel with a local Turkish noble. They eventually established that the noble was in the town. When the lead Austrians got there one fellow started rounding up deserters. I got the kids to throw rocks at the soldiers, another player had deserters fight back, and the dueler found the noble. The figures in the village did not move much. They were all in all the scenes so they didn't need to move. The verbal exchanges were the story at that point rather than where people were located at. That became critical again when the Bosnians sprung their ambush (popping up in unoccupied houses) but much of what happened in town was not about movement. <br/><br/>Players were able to switch scenes after each turn if they wanted. In the town they did this by pointing to different figures and then taking the story there. When they did this they were scene framing (without knowing they were doing that). Action was able to shift rapidly from scene to scene like in a movie with quick scene cuts. There was no expectation of role playing anything (by which I mean one player expecting to get all the GM's attention for a period of time) so the choppiness  wasn't a problem. Also since everyone can jump into any scene there was no "sit around with nothing to do" effect (a feature of role playing that I really don't like). <br/><br/>Unspoken rules<br/><br/>Are there really lots of social rules governing the game? Of course there are! The "rules" of the game are just a way to mediate a conversation. The unspoken rules are about how we act in conversations. Every culture has different rules. In my case the game was based off of Midwestern norms. Polite, not too confrontational but with an element of competition. Humor is appreciated and rewarded as is cleverness. SYW players are an educated lot who enjoy the enlightenment, classical music and try to emulate gentlemen. Very agreeable! <br/><br/>If you want to see those rules enumerated read Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son.<br/><br/>But to be less flip, if I write the game up ever for publication I guess I'll have to be more explicit about social skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371772/#Comment_371772" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T21:52:48+00:00" title="April  7, 2012  9:52PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2012 10:19PM by komradebob.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given your own experiences, what would you write about unspoken "rules" for the following categories?<br/><br/>5 Tips for someone preparing to put on one of these game events<br/><br/>5 Tips for someone acting as game-master for one of these events<br/><br/>5 Tips for sharing the info on what the set up fiction is, without cluttering the table with paper<br/><br/>5 Tips for a player playing one of these game events for the first time<br/><br/>Bonus Round<br/><br/>5 Ways to unlonely the Lonely Fun aspect of getting this sort of thing rolling, whether once or more than once<br/><br/>5 Pointers for a player coming from an RPG background about the differences in this sort of play from RPGs (Or from Story Games, or from minis wargames).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371896/#Comment_371896" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T06:58:46+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  6:58AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Putting on an event?<br/><br/>* Lay out a nice terrain board - don't skimp on the kitty litter!<br/>* Don't make the terrain board to large. You want the terrain to funnel the players towards danger.<br/>* Don't put too many figures on the board. Keep the action focused on a few heroes.<br/>* Have plenty of figures off the board that can go on as players make things happen. I like corpse counters a lot!<br/>* Try to cover the table with terrain and figures. It is amazing how much better a game looks if there is not table showing.<br/><br/>Game mastering an event?<br/><br/>* Pick one character to be the main character - everyone is playing him - but also give everyone another faction to play.<br/>* The players need a goal, a secondary personal goal, and a position on whether they want good or bad things to happen to the hero.<br/>* Prime the pump. Show the players they can do something by doing it first. Then let them take the lead.<br/>* Keep the game moving by prompting the players to do things, like movement etc.<br/>* Under no circumstances should you ever win the game! Never!<br/><br/>Scenario building tips<br/><br/>* Games are about a small number to people. Not locations or epics or genres.<br/>* Give the players a very simple straight forward goal. <br/>* Use the secondary goals to create conflict between the players.<br/>* Stick to the tried and trusted human conflicts: greed, lust, wrath, envy, jealousy, hate, revenge, friendship, loyalty, trial and triumph.<br/>* Make it clear to players if they are good or bad. Moral ambiguity may be good in books but doesn't work in games. <br/><br/>Tips for new players<br/><br/>* Relax, it is not hard to play.<br/>* Watch what the other players are doing and do that too.<br/>* Try out something wild at least once in the game.<br/>* Don't take anything in the game personally. It's just a game.<br/>* Have fun with it.<br/><br/>Joining with others - Recruiting players<br/><br/>* Set up a pretty terrain board in a public place - like a sci fi or game con or maybe a store (if they are game and sell figures)<br/>* Have a ten second sales pitch to tell people what you are doing.<br/>* Ask people directly if they want to play - say the game lasts thiry minutes. <br/>* Pull in passers by for a turn.

I loved the original movie. I liked the next two movies. I hated the last three movies. In the first movie there were so many things going on. Defeating the Death Star was the big thing but Luke wanted adventure, lust after the Princess (we didn't know the incest thing then), showing off, grief and loss, and more. Han has bravado, real danger from debt, cowardness, and lust. The Princess had the big goal in mind but also a smart alec lip, somthing to prove, grief, defiance and so on and so on. You didn't know what was going to come next. You liked the characters and wanted to see what came next. The next two movies was what was next. The last three movies had no, zero, zilch tension. You knew what was happening, there were no complex emotions. "You killed my mom so I have to kill ALL of you." The characters were one dimensional. <br/><br/>So if everyone shares a main goal they will play the game together. [We must defeat the Death Star.] They need to have more depth so there need to be a lot of conflicting secondary goals. [You want to blow it up but I want to capture it.] And players have to oppose one another so some of them have to want to make the hero win and the other half make him suffer - but not kill him because that would be too easy...<br/><br/>It seems like three different goals per player makes the game three dimensional. One just doesn't work and two goals only works if the players add in a lot of other material not mentioned by the scenario. <br/><br/>I'm guessing that there is a limit to how many extra goals players can use. Four goals might work but I suspect that five goals or more would breakdown because people would not be able to remember them all - kind of like all the characters in a Dickens novel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371962/#Comment_371962" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T14:04:05+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  2:04PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've actually seen games with characters that have more than five goals.

Players are not absolutely attached to their single character. Barring any gross out of game social misssteps, it is expected that all players will be able to continue to play throughout the whole session, so failure or even disaster for a given character they're championing shouldn't be considered a loss for the player.<br/><br/>If a character you're championing does come to a bad end or even a permanent end in the fiction, the host is commited to seeing that you, the player, still have an important way to contribute to the fun and fiction, and is there to aid you in getting back into the swing of the event if you're stumped on how to do that.<br/><br/>There aren't really any losers in these events, but there can be winners and it is almost always multiple winners. Most times it's everybody who participated, and winning is measured during the game in the form of participants giving you unspoken high fives and attaboys for the stuff you bring into the fiction.<br/><br/>Optionally, but recommended, is a post game follow up of some kind. It's a time to recognize the cool things players did in game and discuss the game itelf a bit. What form this takes can vary. It could be some sort of "awards" ceremony. it could be a quick pretend follow up where folks answer questions like the game just played was a film and they talk about what was cool or horrible in it when audiences saw it. I could be a simple round robin session where the players in turn tell the person to the right the one big thing they did that that player enjoyed during the game.<br/><br/>Those are the times the real wins come in, when players show their real admiration for your creativity, good sportsmanship, and enjoyment in having had you there playing alongside them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
