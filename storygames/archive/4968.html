Is this project dead?<br/><br/>You've got a forum to discuss your game but there's no link on your home page and the only way to find it is for someone to send you the URL.<br/><br/>Your e-mail address is in your ashcan, but only the GM has a copy of the book, so the players can't find you.<br/><br/>So here's a little activity for you: check all the routes of access that people are likely to take to reach you.

With virtually everything being in some forum or another, I looked up to see whether they all had up to date contact information and found that, surprise, surprise, in two of them the email-addresses were outdated. (They are still active but I don't check them very often.) Not really a problem as they aren't available to other users there anyway, but who knows when I suddenly forget what my password is...<br/><br/>A positive surprise was that in every case, there were links to my forum and blog as well as other ways to reach me, like IMs or Private Messages. Also, both on my blog and at the forum there are ways to contact me, generally with email or, again, IMs.<br/><br/>So, I think my online presence passed the test. Not that anybody ever contacts me, but it is good to know they they could. I guess. Although that means that nobody wants to contact me, which isn't all that nice a thought...<br/><br/>Damn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111783/#Comment_111783" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T20:36:39+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  8:36PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>Keep the info up to date on your website is your best bet.

Yep, but not my friends and family contact e-mail.<br/><br/>But, hey... a web site is a POWERFUL mojo: through it, I can disseminate (and maintain) the only the contact methods that I want folks to use, I can direct most conversation to the forums, and I can easily communicate errata or upcoming projects to the fan base.<br/><br/>Like we've said above; a web site is Step One, in this day and age.
