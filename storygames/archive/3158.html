So if you were going to run something Harry Potter, how would you do it? What system would you use? Would you use canon characters, or customize?<br/><br/>I've been thinking that you could do some awesome HP using SotC.

It was amazing. Best Uni game ever.<br/><br/>I don't think I'd use the canon characters. Maybe do the class that graduated before Harry came to Hogwarts. I'm sure they had lots of great adventures, too (and we'll probably get to read all about them, unless the publisher is insane).<br/><br/>When I ran an HP-like game series, I used the system from John Tynes' <i>Puppetland</i>. It's incredibly simple, captured the childlike quality of things, and was good for the non-gamers I was playing with. Sadly, it seems to be gone from the Internet now.<br/><br/>If I had to do it again, I'd use TSOY -- specifically Judd's forthcoming TSOY-based game, <i>1st Quest</i>, which is built to run stories just like that.

What elements stand out in the Harry Potter books as being the important ones you want to carry over? In your case, you wanted to emphasize the boarding school feel, and focused on a summer camp as an Americanized equivalent.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you're just interested in teens with magic and don't feel the need to maintain the scary away-from-home aspect of the Potter books, you could have an honors class/gifted program in an ordinary school, or a "wizard's magnet school" that the kids get bussed to. This allows you to merge Potter with the American "teen witch" genre, like "Sabrina the Teen-Aged Witch". I've been thinking Trollbabe would be a good ruleset to run a teen witch game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72258/#Comment_72258" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T21:01:01+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  9:01PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty cool, because the "kids at school" aspect is part of HP that's I'm not especially excited about for role-playing.

Also, some of the deep magic, like Dumbledore's Penseive, Tom Riddle's diary, and the sorting hat are pretty neat; much cooler than "I point  my wand and something happens".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72334/#Comment_72334" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T07:33:41+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  7:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, everything I did was later done, better, by the X-Box game "Psychonauts".<br/><br/><a href="http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/psychonauts/psychonauts.htm" rel="nofollow">"Lili!
