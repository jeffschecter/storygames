I've played four games of it since then and we have yet to win, although the last time we came SO CLOSE. (If it made it back around to me, the Scientist, we would have won since I had the cards to win the game. Alas! An epidemic killed us all) So I've been wondering, why is it so fun to lose? I normally have a super-low frustration threshhold for games that are obviously engineered against the players. So why do I enjoy Pandemic so much?<br/><br/>Two theories from Facebook are:<br/>-the post-game 'we could have done x' discussions are fun<br/>-no one is actually to blame since the game is cooperative<br/><br/>Thoughts? I'm wondering if there's anything there that might be applied to roleplaying games in terms of making failure dramatic and fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265374/#Comment_265374" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T16:50:56+00:00" title="April  3, 2010  4:50PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I picked up Shadows over Camelot at PAX. Never played it before. I've since played it four times, three times with two players, and once with two players and two others who joined after we'd started and left before we finished. The game recommends at least three players, and even some special rules if you <em>only</em> have three, so suffice to say, playing with just two makes some things rather difficult. We did manage to win once, but we lost three other times.<br/><br/>And I loved it.<br/><br/>Like you, we came <em>so close</em> to winning, just about each and every time. Even the win that we got, we got by the slimmest of margins. Like Pandemic, Shadows is cooperative (at least, it was for us, since we realized after our first game that this was hard enough without the Loyalty cards and the potential Traitor, so we set that aside), so we had no one to blame. We cooperated against the game. That made it fun.<br/><br/>I also think that the slim margin made it fun. I've heard some people point to this as one of the defining differences between some of your classic Milton Bradley boardgames of old, and Eurogames. Think of Monopoly\u2014most of the time, you can tell who the winner will be in the first half-hour, but the game's going to go on for several more hours before that victory is secured. The rich get richer, which in a game means a long, drawn-out death spiral. When a game remains competitive, it can always go either way. No one ever has a clear victory until the last moment. While few things feel more frustrating than the long beating of a drawn-out death spiral, even losing a game that stays competitive to the very end is a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265375/#Comment_265375" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T17:00:05+00:00" title="April  3, 2010  5:00PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both of your reasons, plus the really tight design that usually makes it a really, really near thing.

Pandemic (and Shadows over Camelot) does this well with its variety of threats and loss conditions combined with a sense of playing close to winning or losing as you near the end of the game. <br/><br/>This makes sense after all, if all failure means is you are stimied or you don't get what you want, then failure becomes less interesting than success. But if there is only one a few ways to win, but a wide variety in losing then failure can be the more interesting and equally or even more enjoyable option. <br/><br/>Designing a RPG so that the endgame has a similar edge of your seat "how will we lose" engagement is certainly viable, but the result will likely lie on the border between a board/component game and a RPG as the mechanics would need to be very carefully balanced. On the other hand, adding this sort of losing is fun component to a smaller scale isn't difficult, but it tends to clash with the goal-based conflict resolution, since to get the variety and predictable unpredictability you really need more functional outcomes than  sides. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I've had great success doing this with <a href="http://wyrmwood.mmo-report.com/playtest/ComingOfAge.pdf" rel="nofollow">Coming of Age</a>(pdf), since early failures are an important part of setting the coming of age path for the characters, I need to make sure that that those failures are interesting and fun. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265458/#Comment_265458" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T13:45:06+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  1:45PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2010 1:45PM by Teataine.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Battlestar Galactica Boardgame is done very much in the same vein. Yeah, there can be cylon infiltrators among the players and if you've got the expansion there can be a cylon leader player, but the majority is always human and you're fighting the ordinary cylons, which are controlled by the game itself. So at the end it's a cooperative players vs. game gig. And wining for the humans is <i>hard</i>.<br/><br/>So I think there's the same appeal. Cooperation on the player side with adversity on the game side, plus the "almost!" factor.<br/><br/>I just remembered Vincent talks about "coming <i>this close</i>" to winning here:<br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/anycomment.php?entry=230" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/anycomment.php?entry=230</a><br/>although his point is a bit different at the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265489/#Comment_265489" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T16:07:42+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  4:07PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should look into Pandemic- although we've had a very similar experience with Ghost Stories.
