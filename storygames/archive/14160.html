If you would like to help shape this event into something that would suit your needs, please don't hesitate to contact me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of this thread is twofold:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) After much deliberation, we've come up with a name for the event. But we want to get opinions on the name before we make it permanent: METATOPIA.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Please feel free to ask questions, throw suggestions, and generally discuss what we are trying to accomplish with this event. I will field any and all feedback received here or in private.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\nVincent Salzillo, President<br/>\nDouble Exposure, Inc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
