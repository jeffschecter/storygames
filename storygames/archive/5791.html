I see it as a combination of the social pressures of the group and, dare I say, the sword of "harshing the zen" hanging over our heads.  Seriously, I have aborted many posts previously because of those three words.  There is now spoken acknowledgment that there is an audience who wants this -- though, the delivery mechanism (for lack of a better term) is still being debated (to use the term <em>generously</em>).  So there, we at least have that.<br/><br/>* Public criticism -- praise is so public, and there is a need for the counterpoint so that members of the community are not mislead into buying books because they see everyone praise it and no one criticize it.  This provides a hook for the second goal of reminding people that there are voices willing to tell you your product isn't perfect and wonderful, and are willing to do so publicly.<br/><br/>* Civil criticism -- you know what doesn't help?  "Man, I read <em>Mythender</em> and it gave me cancer.  I hope the writer dies of a feral cat attack."  Hyperbole?  Sure.  Seriously, being civil is good.  I feel weird having to expand upon that.  (As an aside: do I always succeed?  No, but it wouldn't be a goal of mine if it was something I always succeeded at.)<br/><br/>* Public praise -- the unchecked public praise here is, in my view, dangerous.  It promotes poor books based on good ideas, encourages the next set of authors to make books based on the limited praise they've seen in the last run, and overall is the biggest hurdle in this being an insular, incestuous, dwindling community.<br/><br/>* Not unwelcome -- as I said in another thread and as the first point here, such comments have felt unwelcome in this community, even civilly and for the hope of helping the community as a whole.<br/><br/>* Published, sold products -- I'm not so concerned with products in development right now.  I have given private feedback to those, because that's, in my view, where develop-level feedback goes.  No, here I'm talking about products that have been published and are being sold to a public.  I'll argue that, sure, a developer has a (weakly-enforcable) right to ask people not to post criticisms publicly.  There is no way that someone who asks money for their work does, though.  If a work becomes publicly consumable, so must its criticisms.<br/><br/>So, all of you talking about how harsh criticism is bad for design, how asshole, shotgun criticism as bad for the vibe, etc., sure, I get all that.  It's also has zero to do with my point (though, I can't speak for Paul, Josh or Judson).  Anyway, that's where I'm coming from.  Shoot, I don't even see why said criticism has to be posted in full on this forum -- as long as the community can be made aware of it and it can be referenced here, just like any other gaming-related discussions.<br/><br/>It's not that those of us in the powwow at OrcCon feel like we've been screwed over here by people taking advantage of the good will of this community (though that is how some of us at least do feel), <em>it's that we haven't felt like we've had a voice, like we'd just be shouting in the wind</em>.  For those of you who want to point out that, technically, we have had that this whole time, fine, sure, but keep in mind that the social elements of this community has affected each of us separately to buy into the idea that we didn't.  So, are a dozen-plus individuals totally off-base, or is the community doing something to promote this vibe?  I believe it's the latter, and that's what I'd like to help correct with the (sigh) New New Honesty.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129649/#Comment_129649" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T04:32:02+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  4:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>I'm glad you've articulated this, and I think a lot of people will gain something from it.<br/><br/>I know there's probably reasons all of you haven't taken advantage of this, but The Forge has been a place for real, actual criticism of games from the beginning, and continues to be, and I invite you to participate there.

There are things to critique about the book as an artifact that are separate from how the game plays.  In fact, Fred (I think) recently commented about how the <em>Sons of Liberty</em> cover drastically undersells the book.  I agree, and with his seconding of that sentiment, I'll probably investigate getting new cover art for later printings.  Fred has, to my knowledge, not played the game, and yet he's still given me useful feedback.<br/><br/>And as to the rest, Ryan, yeah, I agree with you on mostly everything.  The only place where we divide is your 'sold' point.  Games that are released for free are still published, even if they aren't sold, and the community can benefit from criticism on those, as well.  I also lean that way for open playtests -- that's also publishing, and once the thing is released into the community, it becomes a valid topic of discussion and criticism, in my book.<br/><br/>Ben -- I think it's safe to say that the problem ain't with you, man.

The designer, by the way, seeing that (1) the customers buy his game thinking that it's perfect, and (2) nobody criticize it or say anything about these problems online, can think this about your e-mail: "bullshit, no other people had these problem's, it's you"<br/><br/>2) If everybody has these problems, nobody talk about the game at all. Some people write some e-mails to the designer to let him know about the problem they found, but without discussing these anywhere the designer has no idea if they are representative of the problems of the other people who don't play the game. During this phase, the game die the death of general indifference and not being played.<br/><br/>I was reading the early threads at the forge a few minutes ago (I was searching the forum for some info on a total different question), and I was surprised to the amount of open and direct criticism that the Sorcerer hardback got, in the forum, by people very active in the forge community then and now.

Story Games does have a reluctance to "harsh the zen" as part of its charter, and that is both liberating for people who want a place to kick back and relax and stifling for people who want a place for no-holds-barred criticism. I wonder if things aren't better served by separating those two concerns.</blockquote>\nI agree with what Clinton is saying here about Story Games; I don't think this is the place for the New New Honesty.

At least, not well.<br/><br/>Some on this thread have said they don't find the Forge useful for getting the Criticism, fair enough, if so. Personally, I pretty much stopped finding The Forge useful when they closed the RPG Theory forum.
