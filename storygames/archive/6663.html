What if, during the middle of the dungeon, the meaning is changed or defunct? Can abandoning the dungeon be just as good?<br/><br/>I'm searching for something here but am having a hard time saying it. How does a DM/GM string together tactical combats with strong meaning, making the fight worth fighting and not just murder and thievery?<br/><br/>Assume I am playing the game I want to play.

Freeing prisoners?  Undertaking a pilgrimage for a religious rite?  Bringing back the body of a loved one for proper burial?  Getting a magical something that can cure disease for your child?  These kinds of things make good "quest level" motivations.<br/><br/>For dungeon style play, I usually load the dungeon with a couple of groups in conflict, ala a Conan story or a DitV town.  Here come the adventurers, of whom everyone is both suspicious and maybe looking to use, and the players get bits of story of what's -really- going on, and they do stuff and make decisions and get into fights.  Folks who come at it with the usual D&amp;D "Kill everything" mentality quickly find that they might not be making the right choices OR making good friends along the way.<br/><br/>I think the big problem is that most tactical roleplaying has looked to other tactical roleplaying for the purpose of framing a "story", instead of stories which feature a lot of action and combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147650/#Comment_147650" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T10:34:56+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:34AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, cool, let me ask everyone some questions that I don't think I know the answer to, but it may seem like I'm asking leading questions.<br/><br/>In the protecting refugees scenario, can't framing combat make it not meaningful?<br/><br/>For example:<br/>DM says, "You find the Andorrez refugees just as you thought.

That's meaningful, the fight is desperate.<br/><br/>The problem with your example question is that the players -don't care- about the refugees, no connection has been made with any of them.  It's different when it's, "Jodir, the father who just wants to get enough to buy back his farm from the landlord so his two kids can have a home of their own", or, "Mala and Siha, the teenage couple that's freaking out because she's pregnant and their parents don't approve", "Hala, the crazy old woman who taught me the Ritual of Healing because I look just like her grandson..." etc.<br/><br/>You build meaning first, then you load up the combats about it.  This is pretty much a classic tactical rpg problem "Oh, save the town", and the players go, "Why?  I don't CARE about the town".   Give the players something to buy into first, then you threaten it, after it means something to them.<br/><br/>(A larger concern is that a lot of old school players have learned NOT to care, because usually if they care about something, it either gets taken away -like Jared's story of trying to own a bar which would always get bombed or burned down-, used a carrot to railroad them, or else something which inevitably betrays them.  You know, because that's -so- awesome.)<br/><br/>With the dungeon style set up, you have to throw the meaningful stuff at the players much like towns in DitV work- players have to quickly pick up that there's more than fights going on here or they won't look for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147672/#Comment_147672" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T11:30:07+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 11:30AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question and/or request for examples.

Let's use something concrete to discuss:<br/><br/>For a party of a cleric, a rogue, a wizard and a paladin, who have taken to Winterfell, a small village near the mountains. (This ignores my other problem, which is identifying when a player values a given piece of fiction enough to want to defend it.)<br/><br/>The cleric's player values the ancient gothic church and its parishioners.<br/>The rogue's player values the children who look up to her character in the orphanage.<br/>The wizard's player values the wizard's tower, still unplumbed.<br/>The paladin's player values the strategic value of the town in her plans for upcoming crusades into orc lands.<br/><br/>So, if I leave the orc invasion as an imminent threat, the players can decide when to thrust forward with that part of the game, wherein I threaten what they hold dear. But, should I? When should I threaten the town? If I leave the players to never deal with the orcs, should I have them invade anyway? A threat without action can be as weak as threatening too soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147689/#Comment_147689" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T12:35:51+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 12:35PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>The cleric's player values the ancient gothic church and its parishioners.<br/>The rogue's player values the children who look up to her character in the orphanage.<br/>The wizard's player values the wizard's tower, still unplumbed.<br/>The paladin's player values the strategic value of the town in her plans for upcoming crusades into orc lands.</blockquote>\nAh, but I think in a more real scenario, you won't see the players immediately reach for, and care about, strata.  We're looking into a slice fo a game that's presumably already been running for a few hours. By that, it's impossible to get them all interested in completely different things unless you were doing scene-style framing with only one character at a time, not having them interact.<br/><br/>Because a normal game, by this time even an average Joe GM will have probably got them interested in 1-2 elements or leads. Now, each player might have like smaller sub-interests ("At some point I want to do something with that gothic church", etc) but it doesn't have to happen right then. Most likely there are going to be issues that 3-4 of the players are going to value just because of the natural flow of the adventure/scenario up until that point.<br/><br/>If you're asking what tricks one can do to make players interested in things in general, or characters (like the ones you have sub-plot or plot ideas for for the scenario), that's a question that's totally divorced from the "fights" question.<br/><br/>I see it as exactly like the meaningful fights I ran in TSOY, or run in L5R... just with a lot more rules in D&amp;D. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147701/#Comment_147701" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T13:18:57+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  1:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the disconnect for me is that I've been doing this for a while in other systems like PTA and TSOY but thought I couldn't run a game like them (story pacing wise).<br/><br/>The key point to not having meaningless encounters is to not threaten anything that isn't cared about.

It was made for the Norwegian convention <i><b>Arcon</b></i>.<br/><br/>The first scenario made players say things like:<br/><i>- This was the worst RPG I've ever played, and the f***** best!<br/>- I'm so sad and hurt I have to go home and lie down, man!<br/>- This was breathtakingly good! No more RPGs for me on this convention!<br/>- I want to cry! <br/>- Wow! I have played D&amp;D for many years, but I never knew RPGs could be so intense!</i><br/><br/>As I said; I would never dream of using D&amp;D for such gaming (or any other mechanics-heavy game), but then I'm an odd one with my own classical RPG, and my own design-philosophy about it. I'm astonished how little work there has been done with methodic tools within classical RPGs!

How does a DM/GM string together tactical combats with strong meaning, making the fight worth fighting and not just murder and thievery?</blockquote>\nOne advantage of a campaign-style game like D&amp;D over other games is that you have the time to build tensions and layer the story over time.  In my long-term (20 years, with infrequent play) D&amp;D game that I run, I figured out a long time ago that great bad guys were one key to making great, meaningful fight scenes.  At some point I stopped letting every combat be a charnel house- the heroes don't always get a conclusive win (or they don't win at all), and sometimes the bad guys get away.  Those bad guys have names, and will come back later, much to the players intense irritation and delight.   At this point, I have plots that have tied up years after they started, and villains who never fail to capture the players' attention.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>(A larger concern is that a lot of old school players have learned NOT to care, because usually if they care about something, it either gets taken away -like Jared's story of trying to own a bar which would always get bombed or burned down-, used a carrot to railroad them, or else something which inevitably betrays them.  You know, because that's -so- awesome.)</blockquote>\nI think this is a really interesting point as well- sometimes with short-term or one-shot games, folks tend to use up story elements too readily.  "Okay, so lessee... you've got a sister that you love, and your family manor, and a sword the king gave you?  Right! So, while you were out hunting, some bandits came and burned your house, stole your sword, and sold your sister into slavery! Awesome!!"  I think the key here is, again, to let these elements mellow over time with the story- let the players develop relationships with the NPCs, and make sure their fancy rocket car gets them through a dozen adventures before you really threaten it.  The more invested the player is- the more they depend on that plot element- the more it will mean when it's in danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147865/#Comment_147865" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T23:54:49+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 11:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Steve,<br/><br/>I think the other thing is that people see "threaten" rather simplistically, usually as kill/destroy.

I don't really want to ask but.."<br/>"What is it?  Ask anything, I'll help out."<br/>"Well, we need 300 gold pieces"<br/>"Why?"<br/>"The landlord said he was going to loan us 50 gold last fall, but he says the interest means we owe 300 gold now, or else he's taking all our cows."<br/>"WHAT?!?"<br/><br/>Since we're talking tactical combat gaming, I'd probably model the landlord off of some of the worst slumlord/strikebreaker types out of history and give him a band of crooked cops/bodyguards, etc.<br/><br/>Just take the worst dickwad-ery you've heard of or experienced and apply it liberally to your game.  Somewhere, the players are going to get hacked off and give someone their just due.
