Your character kicking ass or your character's story kicking ass?"<br/><br/>I think it depends on the game, if my character is supposed to kick ass, then he probably shouldn't be doing the opposite. Having a supposedly kick ass character fail all the time makes me think of Hiro and Kensai in Heroes, which is cool when planned, but I'm not sure how to pull that off on the fly.<br/><br/>"Have you read/played The Shadow of Yesterday?"<br/><br/>I tried, found it dry.

But then a) Mouse Guard is a die pool system so the probabilities are much more reliably average than with a linear system, b) the Conditions are basically the game's equivalent of damage (you don't take 1d4 damage, you get "hurt" or "tired" or "angry" or "hungry", c) those Conditions create situations completely in line with the source material so it feels alot more like playing the comic by doing it that way, d) instead of letting you succeed with a Condition the GM can mix it up by having you fail with a twist ("no you don't get to do that...and now this other exciting thing happens...NOW what are you going to do")<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Only +1 at a time, or +as man as you have?</div>\n</blockquote>\nin the hack I'm thinking of as many as you have...I think it may even be after seeing the result of the roll too.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I'm curious why this one slipped me by.

Using conflict resolution without ensuring equally interesting pass / fail / other outcomes leads to unfun.  But its equally effective for task resolution as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider:  You are a thief...ostensibly a good one...you are picking a lock.  Does:  "If you succeed you get in, if you fail you don't" sound fun?  Not to me.  How about instead (as one possible example out of many) "If you succeed you get in, if you fail you get in, but the alarm is now going off"...or..."if you fail you get in, there's no alarm, but you leave a bit of evidence behind that might get tracked back to you"...or..."if you fail you don't get in yet and now a nosy neighbor is looking your way and wondering what you're doing there."  In other words...dead ends are boring...new branches are interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso note:  it is entirely unnecessary for the GM to outline the "if you fail, then" part in advance.  As long as they are doing something interesting and fun with your failure, you don't need to know which of the above they might choose.  If the GM can't envision an interesting new branch to introduce on a failure...then that's probably a time to just not call for a roll at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224301/#Comment_224301" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T13:07:19+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  1:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could reward the player for failure in some way, thus <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comments.php?entry=467" rel="nofollow">making failure more appealing</a>.<br><br>In a larp I ran, conflicts involved cards.

Some solutions if this continues though, on the mechanics side is to find games which don't rely so much on luck for their play.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarvel Saga (Marvel Superhero Adventure Game) uses the Saga system and is powered by cards. While you can get a hand of bad cards, the rules are set up to allow you to still make an impact on play by choosing which cards go where, or utilizing other rather nifty mechanics to shape play. Playing under "Edge" with low cards lets you play more than one low card, Edge is essentially "Experience" so a higher edge means you can play higher value cards under that mechanic, which means you see an impact on play that is significant. <br/>\n<br/>\nHearts &amp; Souls (my own superhero game) allows you the player--in your "in character" voice, to monologue/pep talk yourself to reroll the dice without stress most of the time. The monologue is tied to your characters reason for being a hero and so as long as the two align you get re-rolls a plenty to make good. Even if you can't think of anything in the current situation, you can still get a reroll for a price. (Stress...which is what causes all bad things in the game to :fallout on your hero.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other games with hero point mechanics (Marvel Superheroes Karma, Mutants and Masterminds hero points, or Buffy the Vampire Slayer's drama points) all which help shore up bad rolls. They're a patch for the randomness and work passably well for what is intended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224326/#Comment_224326" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T14:02:04+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  2:02PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">That sounds pretty workable.

And if you've got a character concept that revolved around being excellent (or at least competent), that can suck.  But when your failure is described as your opponent's success or an unavoidable twist of fate instead, it might feel better:  that botched attack roll becomes your opponent's amazingly well-timed dodge.

Many people (and manuals, for that matter) interpret high skills as a flag of sorts: "Oh, his Pilot skill is really high, it's important to him and I need to find ways to keep Pilot checks difficult for him or he'll be bored."  If you don't make it clear that in this case the opposite is true -- your character is the most skilled pilot who ever flew because you want to succeed 99.9% of the time no matter what your crappy dice do -- things can go sour for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224419/#Comment_224419" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T00:08:09+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:08AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2009 12:09AM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Taking failure off the table like that would require some system expertise.

When I narrate about and sincerely invest in a character in a collaborative story, I am playing a very risky game. I find that such a game is thrilling when my characters succeed, and it is thrilling when my characters fail. When I hand my control of the story over to the collaborative <i>geist</i>, if you will, I experience the thrill of risk-taking and the thrill of story. Having experienced that, it's hard for me (personally) to take pleasure in what feels like the emptier joy of chance-based games and stories.<br/><br/>But, I do think I'm in the minority among story gamers in this outlook, and that's okay with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224574/#Comment_224574" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T17:01:41+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  5:01PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Taking failure off the table like that would require some system expertise.

Botch 100% of the few things you have to actually roll dice for and win anyway.</blockquote>\nThis is another bit where illusion is more important than reality (maybe this whole discussion is):  The player of the Beguiler may not roll the dice, but plenty of dice get rolled to determine if his character is effective or not.  It's just a GM rolling saving throws on your Sleep, Color Spray and Mass Whelm instead of you rolling attack dice.  It is mathematically identical, regardless of who rolls (see "<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/playersRollAllTheDice.htm" rel="nofollow">Players Roll All the Dice</a>" rules option, or 4th edition).  But it seems different to the player, if they aren't rolling the dice.<br/>Indeed, there is definitely this feeling of culpability or fault when your own physical action of rolling the dice leads to your own failure. If you Glitterdust, Got 'Em All and all the enemies somehow make their saves, well, that was the DM rolling, not you. The DM got lucky, and that often feels different than the player getting unlucky - even in a zero-sum situation where the two are exactly equivalent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224583/#Comment_224583" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T17:57:39+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  5:57PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if you think the fun is in carrying out an action, like casting the spell, or in making the attack, you would like that action to at least succeed. So if you attack someone, and you hit, it's more satisfying for the damage to be absorbed by the armour rather than to miss entirely. Same with a spell. This I think made concentration checks very irksome for me with mages in 3e. I only get to cast a limited number of spells, I want them to be cast successfully every time, and then leave it up to the saving throw (or even better, have it carry out the effect regardless, because the effects are limited). I suppose that could be a mechanical solution as well. Have the fighter types with infinite attacks rely on averages. Have the mage types with limited resources have perfect success the few times they have an action. They might not be active all the time, but it certainly is satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224584/#Comment_224584" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T18:03:11+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  6:03PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2009 8:42PM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Well, if you think the fun is in carrying out an action, like casting the spell, or in making the attack, you would like that action to at least succeed.

So, for example, the Beguiler can cast Glitterdust, whose primary effect is blindness (which allows a save) and whose secondary effect is making everything it hits super shiny (no save). The secondary effect doesn't make you win instantly like blinding them does, but it does reveal invisible creatures and make it very difficult for them to hide. And hey, they're covered with glitter. So you did something tangible. Even without a rider, you still warped space or blew something up or whatever, so even if they saved you got your special effects. It's something.<br/><br/>edit: Glitterdust imposes a penalty to hide, not a penalty to hit.

From a play perspective I guess eventually someone will figure it out, but from a design perspective all the spells would have to have such rider effects at least.<br/><br/>This thread and some sleep has really got my creative juices flowing. I just remembered a step dice system I thought up that determined how many attempts/rounds/seconds/minutes (depending on the action) it took to succeed. The better you were, the faster you got it, so someone really good rolls a 1d2, someone bad rolls a 1d12, eventually you'll succeed, but how long it takes is another question. There were some odds problems with this, but it still worked out to a degree.<br/><br/>Another thing I just thought up is having skills increase based on failure. You learn from your failures, not your successes, so each time you fail you get a raise or a partial raise to your skill. If you really are having a lot of bad luck with your dice, eventually you'll hit a point where you're so good it's impossible to fail most actions, while other characters who succeeded a lot early on aren't as good and are failing more. It could work any number of ways, I was thinking of having a skill based on a tally, each time you fail you add one mark to the tally. Once you hit 5 (the cross mark), that constitutes an increase in your skill. In a dice pool system this could be doubly cool, especially if the successes determine how much you succeed - the character who fails more ends up being capable of much more impressive stuff later on than the character who fails less. If things are just a matter of perception, you'll be able to tell because everyone has roughly the same stats. If one character has every stat maxed to the limit, then you can really see their dice are cursed, and potentially do something about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
