It also turns out that there's some books online all about Jeep.<br/><br/>I'm proposing a sort of Book Club in which we read through the books, in chronological order, and discuss them for a while.  My attempts to solo them have not been particularly fruitful.<br/><br/>The books I'm talking about, by the way, are the ones listed at:  <a href="http://2008.solmukohta.org/index.php/Book/Book" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://2008.solmukohta.org/index.php/Book/Book</a><br/><br/>I'm planning on doing these in chronological order, which has its pros and cons, but that's the plan.<br/><br/>So we'll be starting with As Larp Grows Up, 2003.  The first essay is The Threeway Model.  I feel like skipping this just because we've all talked about it for a really long time and I'm not sure it's especially Jeepy anyway.<br/><br/>The second essay is The Vow of Chastity and commentary, pgs 21-32.  Let's start there.<br/><br/>Let's start talking about it in earnest on Monday, May 14th.  Until then feel free to 'tap in' to this thread, but let's give everyone a chance to read through it a few times and formulate their thoughts on it.  Discussion will last as long as it lasts, but I'm envisioning about a week or so before we move on to the next item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377560/#Comment_377560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T12:55:03+00:00" title="May 10, 2012 12:55PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Roger!<br/><br/>These books are excellent, and full of inspirational stuff. (I've even edited one of them, which should tell you how excellent they are). However, they are NOT all about jeep. Jeepform is a very specific thing: A group of people who turned Swedish freeform into a semi-larp art form. Their games are interesting, provocative and excellent. And they're a fairly small subset of the Nordic larp/roleplaying scene. <br/><br/>In the U. S. indie community, just about everything Nordic that involves moving around and not rolling dice gets called "jeep". I understand why, but it's incorrect. A bit like calling all U. S. role-playing games "Sorcerer".<br/><br/>So if your intention is to go through the Knutepunkt/Solmukohta books, you're discussing the Nordic larp scene/tradition, mostly. Not jeepform as such.<br/><br/>Good luck with the discussions, I might jump in!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377572/#Comment_377572" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T13:21:53+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  1:21PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 1:22PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a super great idea.

KP is a key term used on the larp subforum at rpg.net and at rule7 (the UK larp discussion forum) to reference the Knutepunkt cons and books. I think it's a more specific and accurate [label] than [larp].<br/><br/>Some of the articles are short and not super substantive, so you'll probably be able to discuss groups of those at a time. Especially the ones focused on a specific event.<br/><br/>And when you want to talk about the form, calling it Nordic larp (as opposed to just saying larp) usually works just find as a shorthand for Nordic-style art larp. There are plenty of simple fantasy boffer larps and such in the area, but it's the art larp community, by and large, that does the KP cons and writes academic articles and such.<br/><br/>Though, that being said, once this community starts really getting their hands on the form and exploring what it can do, just saying art larp might end up being a good name for a trend/category that encompasses what the KP crowd does and what this crowd does.<br/><br/>(And by the way, those who write serious things about larp have mostly stopped using the allcaps acronym form. They've been transitioning away from that for a couple years now. Though that being said, if I were to publish a wide-audience book on it right now today, I'd be a little torn as to how I'd write it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377791/#Comment_377791" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T10:04:17+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 10:04AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2012 10:04AM by Emily_Care.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Small caps larp is in the OED.

It's an instrument for solving a problem I've never encountered.  Still, it's interesting enough on its own merits.<br/><br/>The title is intriguing.  Vows of chastity are unusual, as far as vows go, insofar as they are vows to *not* do something.  The rules laid out here follow that format -- they are all promises to abstain from certain actions.<br/><br/>The design goals of this document are unusual as well.  Its purpose is to lead its signatories towards designing LARPs that are *different* from what has gone before.  Not "better", in any sense of the word, except insofar as being different may be inherently better.<br/><br/>As such, we end up with a list of presumably the most common features of LARPs extant at the time it was authored, with the constant admonition to avoid that common thing.<br/><br/>Lists of this sort tend to cry out to have their various line items treated individually, so I suppose I can address it at that level.<br/><br/>Item 1 is sort of mysterious.  It "forbids all action in the written character descriptions past."  What exactly remains allowable, if anything, for character backstory isn't very clear to me.<br/><br/>Item 2 is perhaps more straightforward.  No main plot.  Alright.  That would seem to imply that non-main plots are just fine.  But some other parts imply that those are no good either.  It seems like the easiest way to comply with these directives is to charge ahead with no backstory, no plot.  I guess that would be different.<br/><br/>Item 3 is most useful, I think, to the extent that it illuminates the former one.  It implies that "no main plot" must mean something other than "no purely supporting characters", as that gets its own point right here.  <br/><br/>Item 4 isn't so much a design consideration as it is a directive regarding execution.  It tends to reinforce the first two items -- with no backstories and no plot, there is very little to keep secret even accidentally.<br/><br/>Item 5 is remarkably hardcore even by the strict standards of this list so far.  No organizer influence allowed.  Not that they have much left to do by this point anyway.<br/><br/>Item 6 is mysterious in the usage of its word "superficial."  I'm not sure if that's a quirk of translation or what's going on.  In any case, its warning that "it is for many LARPers difficult to imagine a combat-free LARP" is perhaps my clearest indication that this document comes to me from distant shores, a long long time ago.<br/><br/>Item 7 is very clearly drawn directly from the "if it's popular you can't do it" mission statement.  It's sort of strange that other inspirations -- movies, books, plays, etc -- remain entirely acceptable.<br/><br/>Item 8 seems to want to relate to the superficial prohibition, but perhaps it casts a wider net.  It pairs well with Item 9.  Together they make it very difficult, if not impossible, to distance the game appreciably from the local reality in which the players happen to live.<br/><br/>Item 10 makes a liar out of me -- it is not a vow to *not* do something, per se.  Nor is it really related to game design nor game execution.  This rule seems to go nowhere and do nothing, so I'm not inclined to spend a lot of time with it.<br/><br/><br/>Taken as a whole, we find ourselves promising to not do a lot of things.  Things that, presumably, everyone else is doing.  It's an unflinchingly-reactionary approach to design.  It doesn't promise the results will be good.  Only that they'll be different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378387/#Comment_378387" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T07:20:26+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  7:20AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes different = inspirational.<br/><br/>Eirik Fatland, for example, remains one of the most brilliant authors of larp theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378392/#Comment_378392" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T07:38:03+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  7:38AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2012 7:50AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random thoguhts:<br/><br/>Constraints are awesome.<br/><br/>This is as much a rant as it is a practical set of operating instructions, and I am emphatically pro-rant.

We had brief info on the characters and an elaborate dinner, served to us on a boat in the harbor. <br/><br/>All the game material that we used in play was generated in two rounds of sharing that we did about our characters. 1st round: we told what was on our character sheets. 2nd round: we re-capped to bring in people who came in late, this time we riffed off of discussion we'd had about what the characters would be like in today's world (John the Apostle was a blogger, the fishers were heads of big canning businesses, etc.). <br/><br/>It was a great experience in player empowerment, but also I felt like we were exposed and left out there.

Sure, the worst possible "other game" would have all of those elements to the nth degree. But a better one might make use of the fruitful possibilities that game mechanics, secrecy, unimportant characters, or gamemaster intervention might contain.<br/><br/>That being said, having lots of all of those things at the same time sounds like a recipe for badness.<br/><br/>However, jeepform, for example, makes fruitful use of the possibilities of GM intervention, providing techniques such as bird-in-ear to allow the GM to nudge the game toward interesting directions.<br/><br/>East coast "horde larps" make fruitful use of the possibilities of unimportant characters. And System Danmarc specifically explored class differences as part of the point of play.<br/><br/>I play regularly in a scifi game called Starship Valkyrie that makes fruitful use of game mechanics - the dramatic tension in the game is driven through interaction with the system mechanics.<br/><br/>And the occasional secret (with multitudes of ways to ensure that the secret is revealed during play) can be lots of fun.<br/><br/>Very good games can be made without entirely abstaining from those things. But I agree with the notion that they should not be used reflexively as an assumption of "that's how it has been therefore that's how it must be". And I agree that they can definitely be problematic areas when mishandled.<br/><br/>I also agree that this article should be looked at as an historical artifact. It's one of the big pieces that lead to the definition of the Nordic art larp as a "thing", separate from the typical escapist boffer fantasy larp (which are, still, to the best of my knowledge, the typical games over there, as well, though they have differences from their American counterparts).<br/><br/>The manifesto documents serve a function extremely similar to the early Forge writings and GNS definitions, which served primarily to define Narrativism as a "thing", and to rally people around to explore more about what that thing could be. As such, the first parts of the defining process consist of drawing differentiations between the different styles. After that, more subtle terms and definitions could emerge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378519/#Comment_378519" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T14:39:33+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  2:39PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've more to say, I think, but I want to jump in and remark that as a document it illustrates well that old saw about "Boldness has magic in it."

And the extremity (just like the film version) is more a statement than iron-cast rules that can't be broken. Happily, I think larps has progressed far more in that time than movies have! \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>Item 1 is sort of mysterious.  It "forbids all action in the written character descriptions past."  What exactly remains allowable, if anything, for character backstory isn't very clear to me.</blockquote>\nReading it, it reminds me of the (relatively brief) Montsegur character descriptions. I think the impetus is to make it clear that the game should be focused on creating 'live' conflicts during play rather than trying to work out 'historical' conflicts that exist only in character background. That being said, I think Nordic techniques of playing with different time periods during the course of a game enable past &amp; future to live in the players' minds.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>Item 4 isn't so much a design consideration as it is a directive regarding execution.  It tends to reinforce the first two items -- with no backstories and no plot, there is very little to keep secret even accidentally.</blockquote>\nI think it's also meant to help eliminate the organiser from story involvement once the game has begun. This doesn't actually strike me as that harsh a rule as in the detail it says that it's down to player choice as to whether they want to know the 'secrets', not that all players _must_ know all secrets. Larps are pretty good at inherently restricting information during play in any case as no player can be everywhere at once, so elements of secrecy can still be present, but generated 'live' rather than preset.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>Item 6 is mysterious in the usage of its word "superficial."  I'm not sure if that's a quirk of translation or what's going on.</blockquote>\nThe wording's pretty identical to the movie Dogme 95 vow 6 "The film must not contain superficial action (murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)" It must have been a pretty bold statement to make for a larp in those times, but if immersion is really your goal (which is what this all feels like its heading towards) then violence will necessarily break the suspension of disbelief as there must always be game mechanics to deal with them. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>Item 7 is very clearly drawn directly from the "if it's popular you can't do it" mission statement.  It's sort of strange that other inspirations -- movies, books, plays, etc -- remain entirely acceptable.</blockquote>\nIt's using a pretty broad brush here. In the detail they state that the reason is because in tabletop there must be a GM shaping the world (and ergo story). I imagine they'd be far happier with larps being inspired by GMless games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>Item 8 seems to want to relate to the superficial prohibition, but perhaps it casts a wider net.  It pairs well with Item 9.  Together they make it very difficult, if not impossible, to distance the game appreciably from the local reality in which the players happen to live.</blockquote>\nVow 8 makes senses from where they're coming from I guess. I come from a theatre background and the idea that an object can be represented by another (or indeed, nothing at all) would pretty much be the death of improv. In a theatre performance you have to go one way or another: either everything has to be what it appears to be or anything can be anything, irrespective of how it appears. THe audience will accept either, but dislikes mixing the two. But even audiences will accept that so long as something appears to be what it represents, it doesn't have to exactly be the thing the characters are seeing. Forests and castles can be painted canvasses etc. This vow here saying that if you can't have a sheet for a wall or a tent for a house is pretty harsh and virtually forces larps to be set in a relatively modern era or for significant building work to be required.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>In other places it seems internally inconsistent. For example, I can't author 'supporting characters" but must also reject perfect balance among characters.</blockquote>\nI think they're making a difference here between balancing character involvement in the story ("every character must be directly involved in the conflicts that touch it") and rejecting balancing of character abilities/starting position ("all players must have the same opportunity to find the treasure").\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>Constraints are awesome.</blockquote>\nI agree, restrictions are the mechanism that we all use to provoke inspiration and enjoyment. There's an ur-story game which is nothing more than a group of people telling a story together, but it's not a great deal of fun. Everything else introduces constraints or restrictions that (if they're effective) inspire the fun story telling.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>However, jeepform, for example, makes fruitful use of the possibilities of GM intervention</blockquote>\nAnd some jeep games make effective use of past history, supporting characters, superficial action, object representation and sometimes even secret knowledge. But all, I would think, in very different ways than they were being used at the time this was written. I 100% agree on boldness being necessary to break thinking out of a rut. Sometimes you never realise the assumptions you're making until they all get stripped away. And then there's nothing wrong with adding things back, 'cos they'll never go back the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378670/#Comment_378670" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T14:08:30+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  2:08PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, everyone!

To an extent we can learn the impact from the works written subsequently, but given this is all within recent memory it would be good to get some views on what happened as a result of each doc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379191/#Comment_379191" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T18:30:11+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  6:30PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Precious few games exist which adhere to the Dogma manifesto in its entirety (I only know of <i>one</i> for certain), but its general impact was huge on [the scene which self-identifies as] "Nordic larp".

And it lives up to its billing as a manifesto.<br/><br/>It's pretty much all hardcore immersionism all the time.  Never break character.  That doesn't seem like an especially radical approach these days, which perhaps speaks to its impact.<br/><br/>Much like the tabletop theory side of things, there's an acknowledgement of how efficiently the gamists can come to dominate play.  So this sort of hardline approach has a certain sensibility to it, if you can see past all their One True Wayism.<br/><br/>At the same time, I can't shake the feeling that this is a document written by game authors for game players, rather than an authentic grassroots movement by players themselves.  That isn't necessarily problematic, but I sorta feel like the state of the art has moved on.<br/><br/>There's a certain refreshing purity that comes from this vow of chastity.  In a lot of ways, it asks the player to do less.  As a baseline, a new player could do a lot worse than to start here.<br/><br/>Although it has a very personal, even intimate, tone, I find this a very social document.  It really points out to me that I have a great deal of impact on my fellow players, with all the implications of social duty that carries.  It's the first time I've personally seen this notion of subjugating my own desires to the greater demands of the game, and it's intriguing.  While Dogma 99 beats the drum that every character is equally important, here I get the sense that every character is equally unimportant.  Two sides of the same coin, but the emphasis changes the message for me.<br/><br/>It's as pure a Purist-for-System expression as I've ever seen, which is a little surprising for me to realize, although it seems obvious in retrospect.  This Vow of Chastity isn't just about System, it *is* System.  I'm not sure if it's a particularly effective System, but at the very least it is articulated with great clarity.<br/><br/>The old saying in public speaking is that if you don't know what you're talking about, at least say it loudly.  I appreciate the similar sentiment here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379764/#Comment_379764" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T12:33:21+00:00" title="May 25, 2012 12:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one had anything to say about Turku.

First of all, the bombastic tone, I don't know whether the writer thought that by copying from the Communist Manifesto he was implying a tone of irony or exaggeration for comic effect, but anyone who seriously writes:<br/><br/>"Turkuists openly admit that their goals can only be achieved by taking down by force the current system of roleplaying."<br/><br/>is not someone who I want to be in the sandpit with.<br/><br/>This article reads like its trying to be about what larp _can_ be, however the result is a dictatorial instruction as to what larp _should_ be and what larp should be is what _this writer_ thinks it should be, with everything else dismissed as inferior.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm not sure how seriously I should be taking this entire thing.<br/><br/>As I read it, fundamentally, what this writer thinks larp should be is a tool for education rather than enjoyment (or "pointless entertainment" to quote Turku). That simulationist larps can be "used as a tool for experimenting with different social models" and be considered a "(method of) science" and that immersion/el\xe4ytyjist can "give great, subjective insight into difficult topics".<br/><br/>(Mentioning el\xe4ytyjist, is this truly a word that cannot be properly translated - and hence why it is the only untranslated word in the entire article? If not, its repeated use comes across as quite pretentious.) <br/><br/>There is a particular mention of the larpwright/GM's 'message'. The problem with this is that, while you can control what the GM says, you can't control the ultimate message that the participants take away from it. Suppose you are writing a larp and you want to deliver the message 'War is hell'. While you can set up the situation so that the characters have a miserable time of it, an immersed player can end up having a very different experience, revelling in the carnage he creates or the liberty he's afforded. <br/><br/>To be honest, I don't see the great benefit in drawing a distinction between  the simulationist and immersive approach. You cannot have simulation without immersion. You cannot have "social philosophy and behavioral psychology put into practice" if the players are not working to immerse themselves into their characters. <br/><br/>The the majority of the vows themselves are slightly different derivations of the basic thrust to encourage 'method acting' (or, more precisely, what people mistakenly think is method acting) in larping.  <br/><br/>I agee that immersion has value, but it should be a tool in the larping toolkit rather than the be-all and end-all of the pursuit. <br/><br/>I personally am very glad that - whatever achievements made by the Turku manifesto alluded to in the introduction - that there are groups, like Jeep, that explicitly subordinate immersion to other goals and have done quite well in the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379896/#Comment_379896" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T02:03:05+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  2:03AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epistolary Richard</cite>To be honest, I'm not sure how seriously I should be taking this entire thing.</blockquote>\nYou're supposed to take the surface <i>tone</i> of it for the joke it actually is, bombastic exaggeration to make a point and have it talked about more, but to take the content for a pretty serious thing.

From my experience (or perhaps this is my cultural background) you tend to bang the drum in such an exaggerated manner when you're actually arguing the opposite (hence going for satire). Trying to convey a serious message by arguing for it in an overblown manner... for me, the delivery makes it harder to engage with the content.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>On the simulationist side, I think you have players who are, well, simulating their roles.

Particularly this section:<br/>"people do not know themselves - they have defined their image of themselves at some early developmental stage, and can\u2019t see how it could be anything else. It would be so much better if they could try to live in a different world, or a different society, for a while, and then try to see themselves in a new light after that experience. Well, they can! Through the simulationist way of role-playing - which is, or can be, social philosophy and behavioral psychology put to practice."<br/><br/>It sounds to me as though they're not trying to simulate anything - particularly if they consider it can be a tool for behavioral psychology. Their definition of simulationist seems to me to be a subset of immersion. I can see it being used to describe a type of larp - i.e. a simulationist larp is trying to model the functions of a larger collection of individuals whereas an immersion larp is aimed to provide an authentic personal experience without a particular focus on the individual's role in the wider society, but having it as a subset to describe a type of player seems unnecessary. Irrespective of either type of larp, the player is still trying to immerse themselves into the role.<br/><br/>Unless what they're getting at with simulationist is that you are essentially playing yourself and seeing how you feel in a community that's organised differently. That would be a different type of player, but one that would have to have quite a specific type of larp.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>"SPEED UP"<br/><br/>(just kidding.  Or am I?  Yes.  Really?)</blockquote>\nYeah, I read the next two, but don't really have much to say about them. I found The Meilahti Model to be a terribly earnest attempt to provide a solution to something that wasn't really a problem. I agree with them that to communicate on a topic, the participants need to have a shared vocabulary, but productive communication is possible even though the participants don't agree on the exact definitions of every word. I don't really understand their distinction between role and character. It doesn't seem to add much and just muddies the waters. And, obviously, I don't agree with their ultimate definition of an rpg of requiring a gamesmaster and a player. And what is with the black and white photos of someone gurning into a camera (or perhaps photocopier)?<br/><br/>From the title, I thought Why do Bad Larps Happen to Good People? would be quite interesting, but I found the actual text to be a relatively rambling take on i) what a larp is, ii) different larping styles/priorities, and iii) some thoughts on simulation in larping. The one concrete example of a larp 'going bad' is mentioned in passing and the difficulties simply attributed to differing expectations between the organisers and the participants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380062/#Comment_380062" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T10:43:52+00:00" title="May 29, 2012 10:43AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Richard, yeah, I see what you're getting at with respect to simulation and immersion.

And they do eventually address the notion that the duties of gamemaster can be spread across space and time.<br/><br/>The idea of the gamemaster as the keeper of diegetic truth is sort of interesting; lumpley explores the issue further in <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=460" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=460</a> which I recommend to everyone's consideration.  I would say it remains an area of controversy.<br/><br/>Also interesting is that they see the fundamental problem with computer-as-gamemaster as being merely a technical limitation.  I certainly find it an inviting avenue of exploration.<br/><br/>This essay has a simplicity to it which can be a bit deceptive.  As a structural framework it really only gives us a handful of blocks:<br/><br/>players<br/>gamemasters<br/>roles<br/>interactions<br/>diegetic frames<br/><br/>Yet there continues to this day very important work based very closely on this foundation.  As an example, the idea that "RPGs exist so people can say interesting things to each other" is really just saying "Of those blocks, 'interactions' is the most important one."  Meanwhile the hardcore simulationist might be tempted to say that the purity of the diegetic frame is actually the important thing.  Gamists are about the players, immersionists about the roles.  There's still a lot in here.<br/><br/>It's also intriguing in what it leaves out; notably, System.  It implies here and there that System happens, somehow, yet it's easy to walk away from this with the impression that perhaps System Doesn't Matter -- or, at least, doesn't matter as much as you might think.  I'm not sure if that's intentional on their part or not.<br/><br/>I suspect I'll find myself coming back to this model on occasion as we progress along through the book club.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380838/#Comment_380838" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-05T10:20:39+00:00" title="June  5, 2012 10:20AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Why do Bad Larps Happen to Good People?</b><br/><br/>Good title, but I'm not sure the article lives up to its potential.<br/><br/>It boils down to "social contract is important" which hardly seems groundbreaking at this date, but perhaps it was more revolutionary back in the day.<br/><br/>Still, advice like "everybody should participate in a larp from a different culture" is certainly sound, and probably bears repeating.  For all the good the Threefold Model has done, it may have had the effect of encouraging people to self-segregate into clutches of "their own kind", to their detriment.<br/><br/>After that we get a bit of a plodding rebuttal to Meilahti, which is sort of historically interesting but doesn't really feel especially relevant.  <br/><br/>If nothing else, this article should be remembered for this gem:  "I can describe my idea of perfection. It is a larp written by the Finns, produced by the Swedes, infused with meaning by the Norwegians, and enjoyed as though all players were Danes."<br/><br/><br/>Next on the agenda we have "Interaction: The Key Element of Larp", pages 67-72.

It's yet another attempt to tackle that whole "so what the heck is larp anyway" question, which apparently was quite the burning question back in 2003.<br/><br/>His answer sort of boils down to "it's the interaction, duh" which seems necessary but perhaps not sufficient.  He doesn't really address at all the cases where there's lots of interaction but it's still not a larp.  Which is fine, but he's playing a bit on the fast-and-loose side of things.<br/><br/>This may seem to stand in contrast to the Turku thing we just saw, which as we recall suggests that eight guys all sitting alone in their own closets for an hour is perfectly-acceptable as larp.  However, here we have an exceptionally-wide version of "interaction" -- the interaction between the roles and the world and the surroundings are explicitly included.  So the mere absence of role-to-role interaction is not actually a problem.<br/><br/>It is useful to get into this idea of the distinction between the character as its written in the ideal and the role as it is implemented during play.  The difference between Sean Connery's James Bond and Roger Moore's, as an example.  The terminology isn't terribly strong but it'll do.<br/><br/>I think the author paints himself into a bit of a corner when he suggests, theoretically, all non-diegetic objects can be excluded from a larp.  The problem is our participants, who are explicitly identified as non-diegetic.  A larp without participants is like a forest without trees.<br/><br/>As obvious as it seems, there's still no shortage of games of various sorts which just don't have enough interaction.  So maybe it is worth saying again after all.<br/><br/>As an example, I suspect some people's complaints about their own games of PrimeTime Adventure boil down to "lots of participant interaction, not enough role interaction."  It might be a useful way to look at the issue.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
