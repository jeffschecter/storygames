I have had a couple of successful sessions now, and my main tip is to avoid trying to overplan. A lot of game play in this is player-driven, by their secrets and the very individual things that the characters are facing. Here's a couple of things that have worked for me.<br/><br/>1. Once everyone's gone around and generated secrets, use these secrets to create your cobwebs. The players don't need to understand the connection between the secrets and the cobwebs, but it helps if you understand.<br/><br/>2. Set up the Gathering place and some of the other characters who hang around the player characters early. That way as events begin to snowball, you have some other people that you can involve in what's going on. Also, you have some victims for cobwebs to increase the sense of danger.<br/><br/>3. Let the scenes grow organically from the secrets, but take a strong hand in setting scenes. It's good to have some idea where you think a scene is going. The players are kind of at sea at first because everyone else knows what their secrets are but they don't have a clue. Despite my earlier tips, make sure you guide things within scenes and offer a strong sounding board for players. The GM has a significant role in the game, it's not all freeform.<br/><br/>I think it's probably best if you spend a whole session just on character generation, but if that's not possible, take a long break between character generation and the first scenes so you can read over the secrets sheet, think about the characters, and work out what you want to do as a start.<br/><br/>I've mostly run one-shots with this, which I would not recommend. The game's set up for long-term play and the coin economy really doesn't work for just a single session.<br/><br/>Hope that's helpful, and I'm happy to answer specific questions as well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Genius" title="Evil Genius"><img alt="Evil Genius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/933/nIYAYGDL37TU5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Genius">Evil Genius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350005/#Comment_350005" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T23:14:32+00:00" title="November 29, 2011 11:14PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the advice - it's most appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kalysto" title="kalysto"><img alt="kalysto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kalysto">kalysto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350264/#Comment_350264" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T02:59:37+00:00" title="December  2, 2011  2:59AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was enthusiastic with the system, the only point about which I would like to have some return is the "buying of scenes" mecanic                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
