But the relationship is complex. Basically, both games have incorporated elements from each other, as they were designed in parallel.<br/><br/>In 2007 I designed Archipelago, the very first version. It was different from the current version in a few ways; two important differences are that it had no fate cards and no resolution cards. In other words, there was no "Yes, but..." or anything like that.<br/><br/>My friends Ole Peder and Martin had been working on their game Itras By for something like five or six years by then, I think. It was getting serious, and they were going to self-publish it, finally. <br/><br/>There was a lot of crossover and game talk between us; we played in each others' campaign, playtested each others' games, etc. <br/><br/>As I recall it, Ole Peder and Martin were all about setting and technique, but didn't really know what to do with the game system. There was a dice system going on that worked okay, but didn't really feel like it matched the setting - one of those systems that are designed not to interfere with role-playing, more than to help it. The "killer app" (apart from the setting itself) were the fate cards, which introduced randomness and surrealism in the game. They weren't tied to actions, however, just based on player whim. I loved them! (Another game designer had advised Martin and Ole Peder early on to drop the fate cards; luckily, they didn't).<br/><br/>In 2007 I ran an Itras By campaign that was VERY heavy on experimentation. (You can see some allusions to it in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3144/hippie-methods-a-manifesto-dude/p1" rel="nofollow">Hippie Method Manifesto</a> I wrote in May 2007). One of the things I tried out in June that year were some <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/88753" rel="nofollow">impro-based cards</a>. They were a success, and Ole Peder decided to incorporate them into his game.<br/><br/>Itras By was published in Norwegian in 2008, with both fate and resolution cards. (Or chance and action cards, or whatever they/we all ended up calling them officially - there were some different names tried out over time).<br/><br/>In 2009 I put Archipelago II on the internet. It had some major changes - as you've probably guessed by now: I put in fate and resolution cards. The resolution cards were pretty much exactly the same ones that we used in Itras By; the fate cards were generic and very customizable, but the basic idea - to draw a random card that suddenly threw new stuff into the game - was from Martin and Ole Peder's chance card idea. (This has some connection back to the Whimsy Cards of the nineties, but it's uncertain whether the Itras By boys ever actually saw or tried out those cards. I did, once, but while I liked the idea, our group wasn't ready for them at all back in the nineties.)<br/><br/>So there you have it. They came up with Fate cards, I came up with Resolution cards, and in the end, both games ended up using both (in slightly different forms).
