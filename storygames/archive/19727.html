I discovered it in the second issue of Playground Magazine. It's a short game (1 page) that invites you to write a map of a house you've inhabited in when you were a child, then place obstacles to overcome in the rooms, that reflect real-life problems. Then, through your imagination, you enter the house, defeat the foes, collect items after each victory that you might use for the next fight.<br/>It's played in your imagination only and rules are to be bent if it allows a more interesting game.<br/><br/>I've begun an interesting Mooc about <a href="https://iversity.org/courses/gamification-design-online-course" rel="nofollow">Gamification</a> (not sure if it's still possible to join in, I'm following the course but it's already finished) where I was asked as an assignment to play three games and assess what were their respective goals, challenges and rules. Map of house was one of the game I picked.<br/><br/>I put on some introspective music to establish the right mood (I chose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjMCqjDOvRQ" rel="nofollow">videogame Dear Esther soundtrack</a> : melancolic beautiful music, mostly cello and piano) then began to draw a map of the house I lived in most of my life and the totality of my childhood. I enjoyed this part. I used to draw but stopped a while ago by lack of motivation. The game induced me in doing it again. I then created various monsters that I draw a different color. Each one reflected something that causes me difficulty (for instance 'tiredness' or 'lack of focus'). Then I laid down in my hammock and envisioned myself entering with a screwdriver...<br/><br/>I won't further into the details of the journey which is personal on some aspects. But I really enjoyed the game. It was a bit like a dream, induced me to remember what my childhood house looked like and allowed me to be inventive with the story. I didn't plan anything ahead and I think it's a good way to play the game. One action after the other and let oneself to be surprised by one's imagination.<br/><br/>I've the map created on my desk, along a second one that I played later in my current day flat. The second run was played much quicker since I knew the game. It was less surprising (I used the same monsters). But I spent more time on the drawings. I will give it an other try in my first apartment mostly for the pleasure of remembering (a skill I'm usely not very good at) and producing a picture.<br/><br/>The game can be found at page 52 of the second issue of Playground Magazine and <a href="http://www.magcloud.com/browse/magazine/452504" rel="nofollow">all issues can be downloaded</a> for free.<br/><br/>(That's my first post, I haven't introduced myself yet, I'll do it soon at the right place, I'm a 42 y.o. French Larper and occasionnaly story game and RPG player and master)<br/><br/>Quick edit : changed the title for better clarity                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
