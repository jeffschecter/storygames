Although I have no plans for a long campaign in the immediate future, I did have an idea over the summer to try and run a little more dramatic game, mostly to test out the Cortex Plus Dramatic rules.<br/><br/>For my subject matter, I decided to look at Whitechapel during the events of the Autumn of Terror: August-November, 1888, when the Whitechapel murders attributed to "Jack the Ripper" occurred. Don't ask me why, beyond a latent antiquarianism and a morbid fascination with the subject. But I thought it might make an interesting setting for a game, where the PCs aren't investigators but are caught up in it against the backdrop of a terrorized population.<br/><br/>I got interested in using Cortex Plus Dramatic because I think it's a very subversive system and one that does a lot via its mechanics to push stories into a solid dramatic foundation--so I wanted to see how that might work in practice, and how to GM it. I also got to work on some of my "artisinal" GMing techniques, making custom character sheets and a title-sequence.<br/><br/>For various reasons, I decided to do the writeups in the form of a screenplay. The formatting here will get pretty bent, but you can see the<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nq5NH6a0jLfa24LhDyyl7y-nuoGR1_aHgAukP0eVm8E/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"> Google doc in the original format</a>.<br/><br/>I'll use my standard writeup techniques here: <i>[Italicized stuff in square brackets]</i> is my commentary. So far I haven't had to refer to the players in the writeup, but when I do I'll used [Initial of the PC]P to identify them. None of the players from my Masks game are in this one, but I have a feeling I'll run this scenario more than once, so you never know.<br/><br/>Here are the Leads, with links to their character sheets:<br/><br/><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOeS1xQXh0U2VHdGc/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Aubrey Matchington</a></b>: A member of the gentry, Matchington is a brilliant amateur criminologist. He still believes in phrenology, and has a working relationship with both the Met and a mental hospital. Aubrey is intelligent, long-winded, and does the wrong thing for the best of reasons.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOd1hIWTJQNkZVOVE/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Daisy De Lanc\xe9, "Comtesse de Brienne"</a></b>: The daughter of an American steamship tycoon, Daisy married Finnegan Simon de Lanc\xe9, the Irish-Jewish descendant of an exiled French noble family; the title is purely a courtesy, as neither Napoleon bothered to renew it. Daisy has taken up a variety of causes including socialism and secretly works as an abortionist.

She lives in a boardinghouse on Hanbury Street that has an extremely flexible guest policy, allowing it to operate as a very low-end brothel. Rivka works hard to take care of her fellow boardinghouse inmates.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOZFB3WVRUVWtTVTg/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Kathleen Ross</a></b>: Kathleen is an immigrant from County Kildare.

She lives in the same boardinghouse as Rivka, but works as a hatmaker in a factory.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><b>Leah Solomon de Lanc\xe9</b>: Rivka's daughter, adopted by Daisy.<br/><b>Finnegan Simon de Lanc\xe9</b>, Daisy's husband and a surgeon; may be Leah's father.<br/><b>Detective Chief Inspector Nelson Wellington Highgrass</b>: Head of H Division CID; he has worked with Aubrey, and uses Rivka as a reluctant informant.<br/><b>Thomas Ross</b>: Kathleen's father, currently imprisoned in Newgate Gaol.<br/><b>Johnny O'Connor</b>: From the same village as Kathleen and Thomas, a sometime revolutionary and criminal. Thomas was arrested because he was shielding Johnny from getting caught at the riot. In love with Kathleen, an affection she does not return.<br/><b>Dinah</b>: a former inmate of St. Thomas' Asylum.

THE PARLOUR OF THE HANBURY STREET HOUSE \x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>A large crowd of men is mingling with several prostitutes. A young girl tugs on the dress of a woman.</i><br/><br/>GIRL: Miss Rivka?<br/><br/><i>RIVKA SOLOMON, a young Jewish woman in her twenties, looks down at the girl. RIVKA has a kind face, but it shows the determination she has needed to survive the hard years she has spent in Whitechapel.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: Yes?<br/><br/>GIRL: It's Miss Dinah, ma'am. She's went out a while ago to try and earn some money and she ain't back yet.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Did she say where she was going?<br/><br/>GIRL: She said she was going up around George Street, ma'am.<br/><br/>EXT. A STREET IN WHITECHAPEL \x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>RIVKA hurries up the street, pushing through crowds of passersby. She reaches the entrance to a courtyard, and a YOUNG WORKING MAN pushes past her.</i><br/><br/>MAN: Crazy [slur]!<br/><br/><i>RIVKA walks past him and enters a dingy, dimly lit courtyard.</i><br/><br/>TITLE OVER:<br/><br/>6 August 1888<br/><br/><i>RIVKA walks deeper into the courtyard. She glances over to her right, where a woman is passed out near some stairs. She glances the other direction, and then strides purposefully into a corner.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: Dinah!<br/><br/><i>DINAH is revealed hiding in the corner, her back pressed up against the wall.

THE POLICE STATION ON LEMAN STREET IN WHITECHAPEL \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>Several days later, the squad room at the Leman Street station is bustling with activity. Bobbies march their collars in for processing, and clerks hustle around carrying stacks of paperwork. AUBREY MATCHINGTON, a well-dressed member of the gentry in his early 40s, enters the station. He is a little portly but his eyes burn with a fierce intelligence. DETECTIVE CHIEF INSPECTOR NELSON WELLINGTON HIGHGRASS approaches him. HIGHGRASS is also in his 40s, stout, with large muttonchop whiskers. He has a cop's bullish determination, but there is also a touch of sadness and insecurity to him.</i><br/><br/>HIGHGRASS: Good morning, Mr. Matchington. We have a case I think you'll find very interesting. Why don't you come with me to the morgue.<br/><br/>INT. THE MORGUE \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>AUBREY and HIGHGRASS gather around the covered body of a woman on an autopsy table. HIGHGRASS pulls back the sheet.</i><br/><br/>HIGHGRASS: Mrs. Martha Tabram, found a few days ago in George's Court. Stabbed 39 times, if you can believe it. We are of the opinion that she was done by a rip gang, fellows what extort money from prostitutes. Like that Emma Smith who got killed a few months ago. <br/><br/>AUBREY: Any leads?<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS: Not yet. But I'll tell you something, that Rivka Solomon woman, she knows something. More than she's said so far.<br/><br/>AUBREY: How brutal. But sooner or later degeneracy will out. I will let you know if I can determine anything.<br/><br/>EXT. WHITECHAPEL \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>In quick montage we see AUBREY walking through the city, lost in thought, until he arrives in front of the Hanbury Street boarding house/brothel where RIVKA lives.</i><br/><br/>INT. THE BASEMENT OF AN UPHOLSTERY SHOP \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>This basement, connected to DAISY'S house via a tunnel, has been converted into an impromptu surgical theater where she can perform abortions. ANNIE CHAPMAN, a rather run-down woman in her 40s, is led into the basement by JOE, the upholsterer who runs the shop at street level. DAISY, an energetic American woman in her twenties, takes ANNIE'S hand.</i><br/><br/>DAISY <i>(offering her a glass of water)</i>: Please sit down, my dear.<br/><br/>ANNIE: Water? Thank you, ma'am. They say you are a lady doctor--I don't have that complaint, but I do feel dreadful run-down of late.<br/><br/><i>DAISY conducts a brief examination of ANNIE but it is inconclusive, other than demonstrating that she is an alcoholic. There is something else wrong with her but DAISY doesn't have the medical training to be sure about what disease it might be.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: Please lie down on the couch over there, Mrs. Chapman.<br/><br/>ANNIE: Oh, I couldn't stay, ma'am, I have to go out and earn me doss money.<br/><br/>DAISY: A doctor I know will be coming to look after you.

A CELL IN NEWGATE GAOL \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>KATHLEEN ROSS, a young Irishwoman in her 20s wearing her best Sunday dress, is visiting her father, THOMAS ROSS, in his cell. THOMAS was unjustly imprisoned following the Trafalgar Square Riot in November, 1887, but so far KATHLEEN has been unable to prove his innocence.</i><br/><br/>THOMAS: So d'ye have any news for me, Kathleen?<br/><br/><i>(He pronounces her name in the Gaelic fashion, Caitchleen)</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Nothing so far. I tried to talk to some men in the Home Office over the bank holiday, but they were all on holiday or too busy for the likes of me. And some poor woman was murdered.<br/><br/>THOMAS: Ah, you'll get no justice from these English. You're biding John?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN <i>(Annoyed)</i>: I'm pretty sure he's biding himself.<br/><br/>THOMAS: Now Kathleen, John is from our own home town and I told him to watch over you.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: He comes over to check on me when he remembers, but I honestly don't know what he does with most of his time.<br/><br/>THOMAS: He needs a good woman in his life, is what he needs. You bide him. If you're smart, one day the two of you will get honest and move to America.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: I'm not going anywhere while you're still here!<br/><br/>THOMAS: Now, Kathleen, don't trouble over me. Sooner or later the English will find something else to pin on me and I'll be for the noose. Now don't work too hard, a chuisle mo chro\xed. I'll see you soon.<br/><br/><i>(He coughs briefly but violently.)</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN <i>(Looks suspiciously at her father)</i>: Good bye, Da.<br/><br/>INT. THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR OF NEWGATE GAOL \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>KATHLEEN is sitting in front of the desk of WILLIAM FINNEY, the prison governor, a somewhat oleaginous middle-aged man. A loaf of soda bread is on the desk, partially unwrapped--a gift from Kathleen.</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Good day, Mr. Finney. How is your wife? And young Will?<br/><br/>FINNEY: Oh, fine, fine. Mary's enjoying Cardiff. Will is very interested in cricket these days, cricketers this and cricketers that. He's very impressed with his uncle, just back from India. Thank you for the bread, it will brighten my current bachelor state.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: My father seems to be ill, do you know how long he's been that way?<br/><br/>FINNEY: I would have to check my records, but it's not gaol fever--he'd have been removed to the infirmary.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: He has the patience of a saint\x90\u2014<br/><br/>FINNEY <i>(interrupting)</i>: And the constitution of a stout son of Eire.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN <i>(CONT'D.)</i>: --so of course he denied being ill. Is there anything I could bring him? I know it would have to be examined first.<br/><br/>FINNEY: Well, we should discuss this...I would be delighted to repay you for this marvelous bread. Perhaps I could take you to dinner some night?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: I would love to...but my work probably will keep me away. If I can I'll bring some laudanum on my next visit?<br/><br/>FINNEY: Of course, of course Miss Ross.

Tea and some soda bread, baked by KATHLEEN, who is a tenant in the building, are on the table.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: Mr. Matchington.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Miss Solomon. I'm here as a favor to Chief Inspector Highgrass.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Oh, that terrible business. I told the Inspector everything I knew. I found the woman in George Court, and called the constables.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Was she known to you?<br/><br/>RIVKA: No, I didn't know her. I heard people talking about her after, but I didn't know her.<br/><i><br/>[And here we had our first roll--RP put together a pool based around Rivka's Observant distinction to see if she knew anything.]</i><br/><br/>It seems that she was probably being extorted for money--there's a man I know who has been giving us trouble, he beats women with a carpet beater.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I suggest you give the name of that man to the police. One final question: do you happen to know of anyone who purports to have seen the victim before you did?<br/><br/><i>[And now we went into our first conflict, which I badly botched! New systems are fun!<br/><br/>So we put together a pool: Aubrey rolled his relationship with Rivka and Truth. But that was a mistake--his relationship with Rivka doesn't seem to allow for him to not believe her. Rivka put together Dinah and Truth as well.<br/><br/>In any case, Aubrey won by five. And then I effed up the stress. And we couldn't come up with a good way to have Rivka stressed out. Sigh.]</i><br/><br/>RIVKA <i>(Nervously glancing at the ceiling.)</i>: No.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I am sorry to have taken up so much of your time. But I think the police don't know everything yet. The work that was done on Mrs. Tabram was done by a man of passion, not an extortionist with a carpet beater. Good day.<br/><br/><i>[So, Rivka took Frightened stress. AP said that he didn't so much believe that Rivka was lying to him as much as he had said a bunch of scary things to Rivka that made her worried Dinah would be taken back to a mental hospital.<br/><br/>In fact, the conflict should have been centered on Rivka--she wanted Aubrey to stop questioning her and continue to believe that she didn't know anything else...and the whole thing is murky.

I was hoping maybe to have a drink? Now, there's a woman in the back? In the pantry?<br/><br/>DAISY: Not in the pantry--in the\x90\u2014-<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Ah, the hobby room.<br/><br/>INT.

She probably went to get a drink.<br/><br/>DAISY: I told her she could stay the night!<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: But did you give her anything to drink?<br/><br/>DAISY: I gave her water! It seemed perfectly sufficient at the time!<br/><br/>FINNEGAN <i>(reading DAISY'S list)</i>: She's an alcoholic, dear.

Cut things off, sew other things back on. I ran into Highgrass down at the club. Going on and on about that woman who got killed. Dastardly business. He did say something rather unusual--his surgeon claims the killer may have had some kind of medical knowledge.<br/><br/>DAISY: I don't know if I ought to hope if that woman comes back! I don't know if I can fix her--but she does need help!<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Yes, dear. Her and the other eight thousand prostitutes in Whitechapel.

Are you well?<br/><br/>THOMAS: I bide well enough.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I want you tell me why you are here?<br/><br/>THOMAS: I'm here because the English pinched me! I was minding my own business and they swept me up!<br/><br/>AUBREY: Ireland is full of gentlemen who mind their own business, Mr. Ross, and most of them are not in Newgate.<br/><br/>THOMAS <i>(snorts.)</i>: There's more Englishmen than Irishmen in Newgate.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Mr. Ross, starting this week we are going to have more frequent interviews and I want you to understand why. It is on men like you that the future of Britain rests. You have the capacity to become more than you are, or the capacity to become much, much less. Your breeding is not degenerate, that is clear by the offspring you have managed to produce.<br/><br/>THOMAS: Aye, Kathleen is the pearl of great price.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Indeed, she is an admirable girl.

And in that way we may develop a programme to distinguish men like you, whose essential nature is tribal, from men whose essential nature is solitary and predatory. Are you interested in helping me, Mr. Ross?<br/><br/>THOMAS: Well, first off, doctor, I don't think there's any chance of me getting out of Newgate except in a pine box.<br/><br/>AUBREY: There's more chance if I'm inclined to recommend it.<br/><br/>THOMAS: You're not going to be asking me to do anything unnatural?<br/><br/>AUBREY: The natural, Mr. Ross, is what we fall back upon when we don't have any better ideas.<br/><br/>INT. THE PARLOUR OF THE HANBURY STREET BOARDING HOUSE \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>Several prostitutes are sitting around rather listlessly. RIVKA is getting ready to make her weekly visit to DAISY'S house to visit her daughter, LEAH, who DAISY and FINNEGAN have adopted.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA <i>(Looking around.)</i>: What's wrong? Usually you're all at the pub by now.<br/><br/>YOUNG PROSTITUTE: We ain't got any money to go to the pub.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Times are tough. Have you been working?<br/><br/>YOUNG PROSTITUTE: We've been working...I dunno...there's that crazed man about...and...I'd like to go to the pub, but\u2026<br/><br/>RIVKA: Dear, drinking is a luxury. We have to learn to make due on food and small beer in times like this. Have you eaten today? Take some money and buy some food. Then you come straight home.<br/><br/>INT. THE KITCHEN OF THE BOARDINGHOUSE \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>RIVKA enters, preparing to leave through the back door. The building's landlady, MRS. SCHNEIDER, a German woman in her 60s, is sitting at a table drinking gin with POLLY ANN NICHOLS, an English prostitute in her 40s.</i><br/><br/>POLLY: I know what's wrong with them girls. They hain't got no good clothes anymore. Been 'ere a year in a new city, hain't got a thing to wear no more. Nothing like a new dress or bonnet to perk a girl up.  <i>(Knowingly, assuming RIVKA is a de facto madam.)</i> You'll understand this as you grow into yer job.<br/><br/>RIVKA: New bonnets can be lived without.<br/><br/>POLLY: I suppose. I 'ear you have some sort of benefactor.<br/><br/>RIVKA: You mean Mr. Matchington, he is an odd duck.<br/><br/>POLLY: He once came up to me with a pair of forceps! Wanted to measure me 'ead! 'Twas a gennleman, bought me a bottle o' gin after. Not the strangest thing I ever did for me fourpence. But I 'eard you 'ave someone else you call on. Wouldn't mind a new bonnet meself. But as you say, we's gotta 'ave small beer and food before we can 'ave the fripperies.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Now is not a time for it. Let me know if you are in trouble, and I can help you. A new bonnet isn't trouble.<br/><br/>POLLY: A new bonnet can earn a girl fourpence, though. Most of yer girls, this is their first year in London. Some hain't even from England. They can use a bit of cheering up.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Well. As I said, you can ask me for help anytime. Or if anyone you know needs help.<br/><br/>POLLY: You can always ask ol' Polly for the same, Miss Rev--Riv\x90\u2014<br/><br/>RIVKA: You can call me Rebecca if that's easier.<br/><br/>POLLY: Thank ye, I never was good with foreign names. Well, I'm off to the pub.<br/><br/>INT. THE DE LANC\xc9 TOWNHOUSE \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>DAISY meets RIVKA in the parlour, holding a bottle of red liquour. </i><br/><br/>DAISY: Here try this. It's grenadine. It tastes like pomegranate! My sister Virginia sent it from New York. <br/><br/>RIVKA <i>(drinks)</i>: Thank you--<br/><br/>DAISY <i>(CONT'D.)</i>: I don't like it at all! But mys sister sent me a case and I need to try and make cocktails with it. It tastes so industrialized. You can call me Daisy, you know. I'll go get Leah. She's playing piano now, I hope she likes that too. Maybe you should ask her--<br/><br/>RIVKA <i>(trying to keep up with the torrent of words)</i>: I'm sure she likes it very well, ma'am.<br/><br/>DAISY <i>(CONT'D.)</i>: --Well I never liked piano, that was my sister. I'm off to have tea with Mr. Matchington at the club.<br/><br/>CLOTHILDE <i>(coming down the stairs with Leah)</i>: Madame.<br/><br/>DAISY <i>(CONT'D.)</i>: The watercress sandwiches there are terrible, I tried to get them to serve ham but I don't think they listened. Do you like ham? Leah likes it. My father told me there's some new restaurant on Broadway that serves potato crisps. With salt and vinegar, but not chips! Doesn't that sound good!<br/><br/><i>DAISY sweeps up her bonnet and ties it on as she exits the townhouse. CLOTHILDE the au pair returns to the kitchen. LEAH goes to the piano and begins to bang on the keys.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: That's lovely, dear.<br/><br/>LEAH: Maman says that Mozart could play piano when he was just six.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Mozart sounds very special.<br/><br/>LEAH: Maman says I'm going to be just like Mozart.<br/><br/>RIVKA: I'm sure Mozart was a very good boy who minded his mama and that's why he was so good at playing piano. And I'm sure that you will too if you do the same.<br/><br/><i>FINNEGAN enters the townhouse.</i><br/><br/>FINNEGAN <i>(Calling out)</i>: Darling! I'm home--oh! Hello, Rivka, I--I did not know that this was the day. Can I get you anything? I could have Clothilde bring us something to eat...or...something\u2026<br/><br/>RIVKA: That would be very kind, sir.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Good, good, good...er, we can't--that is, we don't keep kosher here.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Whatever you serve me will be fine, sir.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: How have you been, Rivka?<br/><br/>RIVKA: Very well, sir. Despite the news.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Ah, that woman. I'm afraid people get killed all the time in Whitechapel, especially women of that kind\x90\u2014that is...I hope you're all right. Do you need any money or anything? I'm sure I can make it good with Daisy.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Some of the women in the boarding house haven't had anything new to wear in a year. If you had anything you didn't need anymore\x90\u2014<br/><br/>FINNEGAN (Calling out): Clothilde! She'll take you upstairs. Take anything you want from the closet, Daisy will never miss it. Half of it is over six months old, she'll never wear it again. My God, the amount of money we spend on fabric, and then we had to actually bring a tailor in from Paris. I don't know why, all they did was speak French for an hour.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Your wife is very accomplished.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Yes she is, indeed indeed indeed...and one day I'm sure we'll have an heir...to carry on the de Lanc\xe9 name into the next century. I'm sure the twentieth century will be better than the nineteenth...progress and all that. Just hope we don't get into any damned wars by the time he grows up.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Yes indeed, sir.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN (Pained): Rivka, can't we talk? It's just me...it's just Simon.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Sorry, Simon...it's...good to see you again.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: It's good to see you again too. Are you sure I can't do anything more for you? Find you some housing? I could give you some money\u2026<br/><br/>RIVKA: Thank you, Simon. I don't want to move because I need to watch out for the other women there.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: You're such an angel to them.<br/><br/><i>LEAH begins to plink away at the piano keys while the two adults keep talking.</i><br/><br/>FINNEGAN <i>(CONT'D.)</i>: We're trying to raise her just the way you want...I even had a rabbi in a few weeks ago to talk to her. I don't know much about it, that was mother's religion. She was an angry old German lady, always cross with me. If you like, you can come over during the holidays to be with her.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Thank you Simon. I would like that.<br/><br/>RIVKA sits next to LEAH at the piano.<br/><br/>RIVKA: What are you playing now, darling?<br/><br/>LEAH: I'm Mozart!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439280/#Comment_439280" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T15:09:29+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  3:09PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2014 6:54AM by Aviatrix.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EPISODE 1: THE MISERY OF THE EARTH (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>INT. THE XENOPHON CLUB LADIES' DINING HALL \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>AUBREY meets DAISY in the Ladies' Dining Hall. A WAITER and a MAITRE D' follow in DAISY'S wake.</i><br/><br/>MAITRE D': If Madame would just wait one moment\x90\u2014<br/><br/>AUBREY: Hello, Countess.<br/><br/>DAISY: Hullo Aubrey! How are you! Have you heard about that woman who got stabbed? Are you consulting on it?<br/><br/><i>The WAITER shows AUBREY the menu. He nods and turns back to DAISY. Without being asked, the MAITRE D' fills up his wineglass--he is accustomed to DAISY'S visits.</i><br/><br/>DAISY <i>(CONT'D.)</i>: Inspector Highgrass says it was extortion but I don't think extortionists stab people in the stomach, do they?<br/><br/>AUBREY: Highgrass is incomparably Highgrass.<br/><br/>DAISY: You mean that he's an imbecile.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I didn't say it\x90\u2014<br/><br/>DAISY: I'll bet you thought it. <br/><br/>AUBREY: The Countess is as always sharply spoken. Obviously it's not extortion, a crime this brutal doesn't come from extortion. Lust or liquor is what I said when they showed me the body. But the Inspector thinks what he thinks.<br/><br/>DAISY: Have there been other cases like this? The newspapers say it was "unprecedented."<br/><br/>AUBREY: The newspapers think it was an extortion gang with an exceptionally sharp carpet roller--so yes, that's "unprecedented." The usual story is that the man gets angry at a woman he thinks is unfaithful to him. That particular constellation of events doesn't seem likely here, but subhuman men will commit subhuman acts. There haven't been any recent cases like this, though. <br/><br/><i>The WAITER brings out their plates of Dover sole.</i><br/><br/>AUBREY: And how have you been.<br/><br/>DAISY: My sister sent me some grenadine. She thinks it's delicious but I think it tastes like industrial pomegranate juice. Have you tried grenadine, by any chance? Would you like to try it in a cocktail?<br/><br/>MAITRE D' <i>(Aside to AUBREY)</i>: Is monsieur ready for the second bottle?<br/><br/>AUBREY: Please, thank you. <i>(To DAISY)</i> I haven't had the pleasure yet\x90, but I don't think you're supposed to drink it straight.<br/><br/>EXT. STREETS OF WHITECHAPEL \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>DAISY and AUBREY are enjoying the pleasant day by walking back to her townhouse.</i><br/><br/>AUBREY: I've been working on another project. There's a man in Newgate Gaol who is so archetypical of his ethnicity. I don't think he's a bad man--certainly not the kind who would put holes in unfortunate women. He's tribal--loyal to his tribe and to his chieftain. My question is, is it possible to make someone in that position find a better tribe and a better chief--to transfer his loyalties and cease being volatile and instead become a productive element.<br/><br/>DAISY: I don't understand. What tribe?<br/><br/>AUBREY: He's Irish, was arrested during the riots last year. All he knows is that the Irish hate the English and the English hate the Irish, and somehow he has never learned to think anything better. Sad, really.<br/><br/>DAISY: But don't you think it would be better if they got Home Rule? I mean, we set off on our own in America, and that worked out. It seems that Mr. Gladstone's solution is the best, that the only reason the Irish hate the English is that you're ruling over them!<br/><br/>AUBREY: I'm not a political scholar myself; how Ireland will fare when the Irish take over remains to be seen. But this man is in London, and there is no shortage of the problems we have with Irishmen like him, in London. Politics won't solve all of our problems; it may not solve any of them. This is a matter of science.<br/><br/>EXT. THE DE LANC\xc9 TOWNHOUSE \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>FINNEGAN is trying to stuff RIVKA and several packages of clothes into a Hansom cab.

What's going on?<br/><br/>S<i>he grabs a bonnet away from RIVKA.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: I'm sorry ma'am.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Miss Solomon?<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: No, Rivka, keep them--you don't mind, do you darling?<br/><br/><i>DAISY stands in somewhat stunned silence, then leaps into action.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: Cabman, here's a sovereign.

He makes another immediately. CLOTHILDE enters.</i><br/><br/>CLOTHILDE: Tea for five.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN <i>(Slurring his words slightly)</i>: None for me, thanks.<br/><br/>CLOTHILDE: Will that be all, madame?<br/><br/>DAISY: Yes. Just fetch us the grenadine and tonic water.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: I should probably come back when you don't have guests\x90\u2014<br/><br/>DAISY: Don't worry, these guests all arrived by different vectors, and I'm so glad to have you all here for once. Why don't you ever come to my parties, Kathleen? Here's your tonic. Let me know what you think. Rivka what was this about my bonnet? And all these clothes?<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Dearest, I told Rivka she could have your old things, you're not wearing them. And they're just going to waste.<br/><br/><i>AUBREY looks sharply at RIVKA and FINNEGAN and LEAH, trying to puzzle out their relationship.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: OH! Well, they're six months out. But I never wear them, they should go to someone else. But I do like this one, it has the little flowers. If I'm going to give my bonnets and dresses away, do you mind if I go through them first? Clothilde!<br/><br/>CLOTHILDE: Oui, madame. I shall just go unwrap them all.<br/><br/>DAISY: Well, Finegan, I wish you hadn't try to hide this from me! I like this lavender bonnet.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: I'm sorry, dearest, but the last time I asked you about a bonnet, you told me that you didn't wear the black anymore because you hate it.<br/><br/><i>RIVKA retreats to the piano, where LEAH is plinking away.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: That's lovely, darling. What's this song called?<br/><br/>LEAH: Birdie!<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: How are you, Aubrey old man! Have a drink.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN attempts to cover up a fit of laughter with a cough.<br/><br/>DAISY: Are you ill? Can I get you anything?<br/><br/>AUBREY: Your husband is a doctor, isn't he, Countess?<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: No sir! I am a surgeon, and happy to hold the title of "Mister".<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Actually, I come not for myself but for my father. He has a cough, and I was hoping that you could give me a recommendation for something to bring to him.<br/><br/>DAISY: Let me write these down. Tea with honey or peppermint...there's a tonic that my father swears by\u2026<br/><br/><i>The room falls quiet as she writes, everyone basking in the uncomfortable silence.</i><br/><br/>FINNEGAN: What a charming lull in our conversation! I'll have another drink.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Miss Solomon, it's funny to run into you.

It's been a while since I played/read Smallville, but my recollection is that it's more about the cost of RESISTANCE.  The dice do not enforce victory or failure in the conflict per se, only the cost (Stress) for the defender to deny the aggressor from getting their way.  In the example of Johnny trying to drag Kathleen to the pub and winning the roll, my understanding is that while Kathleen lost, she still had the option to Give In and go to the pub, or to stay but take Stress instead, rather than going AND being Stressed.

She tries to step around him, but he plants one arm against the wall, blocking her path. This is JOHN PIZER, an infamous extortionist feared by the prostitutes of Whitechapel.<br/></i><br/>PIZER:  (In Yiddish):  Time for you to cough up some money.<br/><br/><i>RIVKA reaches into her purse and offers a few coins.</i><br/><br/>PIZER:  This isn't enough.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  (In Yiddish):  That's all I have.<br/><br/>PIZER:  Then you'll just have to go get some more money until you can pay the toll. Or those nice ladies you work with will get hurt.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  How much?<br/><br/>PIZER:  Half a crown a day.<br/><br/>RIVKA is visibly stunned by the outrageous amount.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  How much do you think I make?<br/><br/>PIZER:  I think you should go talk to your girls. That's why I came to you, Miss Solomon.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  I don't have that much right now. I'll have to go get it.<br/><br/>PIZER:  Right. But so you know I mean business\x90\u2014<br/><br/><i>He raises a carpet beater menacingly. A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS gather at one end of the alley. RIVKA begins to edge towards them, with PIZER following them. As she gets closer to the crowd, she can hear them muttering angrily.</i><br/><br/>CROWD:  There he is! That's the one! Leather Apron!

THE DE LANC\xc9 TOWNHOUSE PARLOUR \x90\u2014 EVENING</b><br/>KATHLEEN is led into the parlour by a BUTLER. DAISY rises from her chair to greet KATHLEEN.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Kathleen, you came! Finn's at the club. If you wanted to see him\x90\u2014<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  Actually, ma'am, I was hoping for some advice. <br/><br/>DAISY:  Certainly. About what?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  It's about my father, of course.<br/><br/><i>DAISY gestures for KATHLEEN to sit down and they sink into armchairs--DAISY at ease, KATHLEEN a bit stiff and nervous.</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN (CONT'D):  The thing is, see \x90\u2014 I've been in to talk to the Detective Inspector \x90\u2014 if it's been once, it's been a hundred times \x90\u2014 but he's not got the time of day for the likes of me. I've tried to persuade him that my father is pure as the driven snow \x90\u2014 everyone who knows him knows this about him \x90\u2014 and I've started to think that \u2026 well \u2026 it's because I'm nobody that he doesn't listen to me, that he doesn't care about everything that I know about my father. And I've started to think that maybe if I could get important people to say that my father couldn't have done this thing, then perhaps the Detective Chief Inspector would have to pay attention, would have to administer justice. So as embarrassed as I am to be doing it, I've come to you to ask you whether you think this is possible, and whether there's anybody you know who I could plead my case to, who would be willing to talk to my father and learn about what a terrible injustice has been done.<br/><br/>DAISY:  I mean \x90\u2014 I'd certainly be willing to talk to your father \u2026 I mean there are some parts of society who'd cut me off, but it wouldn't be too hard to be cut off from them. And there's Mr. Matchington, of course, who seems to be obsessed with your father for reasons that have nothing to do with Home Rule. I can't remember, he said something about the Irish being a tribe and the tribe being unruly and but then it seems then that they should be separate \x90\u2014 I mean, it worked for us!<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  Yes, ma'am. Of course, if it isn't practical, I'll just have to try something else \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>DAISY:  Of course it isn't practical! Nothing worth doing is ever practical. Most things worth doing aren't the least bit practical. I suppose the first thing I ought to do is meet with your father, and then Mr. Matchington, who probably isn't cut off from so many parts of society as I am. <br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  I've spoken to Mr. Matchington before. I cannot tell what he \x90\u2014 to be honest, I'm not really sure what he's talking about most of the time.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Oh, me either. He's a phrenologist and they're all kooks, though possibly kooks who are on to something, I couldn't say.<br/><br/><i>[For this session I was trying to be a lot more proactive about finding contests. Here I sussed out DP about whether or not this was a contest--since Kathleen was asking for a significant outlay of Daisy's social capital; as I put it, "the ones who would care can't do anything, the ones who could do anything don't care"--but DP felt that until Daisy had met with Mr. Ross, there wasn't enough impetus for a full contest; so we decided it would be a "contest deferred."]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439658/#Comment_439658" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-24T15:13:17+00:00" title="October 24, 2014  3:13PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2014 3:16PM by Aviatrix.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EPISODE 2: Fortune Was Not Kind in this World (Part 2)</b><br/><br/><b>INT. DCI HIGHGRASS'S OFFICE \x90\u2014 DAY</b><br/><br/><i>We see AUBREY walk through the busy Leman Street station bullpen, ignoring the desk sergeant, and walk into HIGHGRASS'S OFFICE. HIGHGRASS is angrily opening drawers, pulling out stacks of paper, looking at ledgers and then throwing them on his desk. AUBREY sits down in front of the desk watches bemused.</i><br/><br/>AUBREY:  Well, I came because I had something to show you, but I think you had better go first.<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  Twenty years I been a copper. Twenty years! It took me that long to get head of me own station. And what happens? They bring back Freddie Abberline!<br/><br/>AUBREY:  This Abberline is a doctor?<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  No! Freddie Abberline is a copper! Used to be head of this very station, til he got bumped up to CID and I got the post. And now they're bringing him back! Because a bloody bunch of [slurs] got their throats slit! Now he's to run the investigation. It's not right, Matchington!<br/><br/>AUBREY:  And what is to happen to you?<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  I'm still to run the station, but Abberline will run the investigation. Freddie's a good cop, but he's going to be running the whole show, and running all over me! He's got contacts all through this bloody borough.<br/><br/>(Pause)<br/><br/>And he's taking my office.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  That I can see as being a problem. Well, I'm no expert in the organization of police forces, Chief Inpsector, but it seems to me that London has not become any less criminal in the time it has taken this mangler of unfortunate women to do his work, and therefore there is no less call for you to do everything you've already been doing, in addition to running a large and complex organisation. If the man who is to be running it should be a subordinate, then I am sorry. But I imagine somebody should be running it, and probably that shouldn't be you, given all your other duties.<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  Well, that's generous, I suppose, Aubrey. What can I do you for, seeing that I am still head of this investigation for the next...three hours and forty-one minutes.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  Good, that should be just enough.<br/><br/><i>He pulls out an enormous sheaf of parchment covered with handwritten notes.</i><br/><br/>AUBREY (CONT'D):  I will explain. No, that will take too much time. I will sum up. I don't know how much use you think I will be on this investigation. After all, I'm not a detective, I don't have your skill in sniffing around people or sniffing around a crime scene. What I have is knowledge of the human mind. And based on the evidence I was able to gather from what was done to the bodies I was allowed to see, I am strongly of the belief that this crime was not perpetuated by an ordinary man for any ordinary reasons. It was done by let us say a man with unusual features for the very most unusual of reasons. Now it is of course a tall order for the police of London to allow me to go around and interview or even examine the skulls of anyone who is remotely suspicious, therefore it seems to me that the only people who would know about this level of abnormality, particularly as directed at the class of victims who have suffered, are other members of that unfortunate class who may have come into contact with this creature or those like him.<br/><br/><i>[Me: We suspect he's mad, but I won't know until I can feel his skull!]</i><br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  So if I understand correctly, what you're saying is that because there's a maniac slitting the throats of women, you want to talk to a bunch of [slurs].<br/><br/>AUBREY:  Your summation is as always admirable.<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  Well, a man of means like yourself shouldn't have any problem, Matchington. <br/><br/>AUBREY:  You may be surprised to learn this, Detective Chief Inspector, but due both to the manner of my presentation and certain proclivities of my temperament \x90\u2014 or rather, the lack of certain proclivities of my temperament \x90\u2014 persons of the kind who I intend to interview often find me off-putting and do not choose to extend the interview for the length of time I require to gain useful information. It is my hope that I will not need to lean on the coercive powers of the law to find out what I need to find out \x90\u2014 but if I do it is my sincere hope that \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  Well, Aubrey \x90\u2014 I can call you Aubrey, can't I? \x90\u2014 as a matter of fact you could not in fact lean up upon the offices of law enforcement as I could not give you that power. However, if you feel that you can, by your investigative capacity, determine some evidence that you could share with, for example, the local constabulary, I for one would be most grateful. As would the population of London at large, of course.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  I have no doubt that your gratitude and the gratitude of London at large would be available should I do anything that particularly deserved it. Abberline, you said the gentleman's name was?<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  Frederick. George. Abberline. Chief Inspector at CID. <br/><br/>AUBREY:  I see. Well, it sounds as though in addition to speaking to you, I should speak to this gentleman.<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  He'll be here shortly.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  Then it seems that I shall return shortly. Would you like to get lunch, as it seems you are about to be relieved of certain unpleasant duties?<br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  Leave the office at eleven o'clock? That would be dereliction of duty. Let's go.<br/><br/><b>EXT. HANBURY STREET \x90\u2014 EVENING</b><br/><br/><i>KATHLEEN ROSS passes down the street on her way home. At the corner she notices a couple of RUFFIANS who seem to be eyeing the boarding house at 25 Hanbury Street. KATHLEEN hurries inside that address.

'E's been watching the 'ouse all day!<br/><br/><i>KATHLEEN looks out and spies a slightly-built blond man across the street. While she looks, he seems to take notice of her watching him, and quickly walks away down Hanbury Street.</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  Good heavens, that's unpleasant.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  Yes, well, if you go around threatening enough of us \x90\u2014 I guess one thing about these murders is that somebody's noticed we're here. As if nothing bad had ever happened to prostitutes in the East End of London before! Suddenly the papers are aware of the fact that bad things happen. I doubt that anything good will happen with the rest of Pizer's gang here.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  If this man is being suspected of the crime, couldn't you mention to the authorities that his accomplices are watching this place?<br/><br/>RIVKA:  (To the YOUNG PROSTITUTES):  We can't afford to not go out, but we need to be safe. I want you all to make sure that you go out with at least one or two other girls, and keep a close watch on each other.

Therefore while I cannot say that you have nothing to fear from them, you may perhaps rest easy in the knowledge that you are not fearing that.<br/><br/>For whatever other fears you may have I cannot say that I blame you. I do feel obliged to point out that this manner of difficulty seems more or less inherent and inescapable in the path of life you have chosen: to wit, courting the company of unreliable men who eschew the comforts of family. Presumably in the long-term there is nothing that I or any man could do about that save for removing you from the equation. <br/><br/>For reasons related to the understanding and eventual capture of the creature who has perpetuated the aforementioned horrors, I will need to conduct a number of extensive interviews at your place of business. If it is your belief that the presence of these men with carpet-beaters is likely to have a dampening effect on the effectiveness of these interviews, I may be able to provide police assistance to prosecute the success of my enterprise.<br/><br/>Please let me know if this is feasible.<br/><br/>Sincerely yours,<br/><br/>Aubrey Matchington, Esq., FRS, etc.<br/><br/><b>INT.

THE LEMAN STREET POLICE STATION \x90\u2014 DAY</b><br/><br/><i>AUBREY walks in to find the station is in a flurry of last minute preparations. Everyone is wearing their cleanest uniforms. HIGHGRASS is standing with his sergeants in a neat line. After a moment's hesitation, AUBREY slides into line next to him.<br/><br/>The doors to the station open and CHIEF INSPECTOR FREDERICK ABBERLINE and his ASSISTANTS stride in. ABBERLINE is a middle-aged man, thickset, with intelligent eyes and a hard demeanor. He wears muttonchop whiskers and has a comfortable swagger earned in years of walking a beat on the East End.</i><br/><br/>ABBERLINE:  (Shaking HIGHGRASS'S hand):  Nelson. Good to see you. And this would be your \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>AUBREY:  Matchington, Mr. Aubrey Matchington.<br/><br/>ABBERLINE:  Ah, yes, the criminologist! <br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  (Deferentially):  You should talk to him, Fred. He has a lot of good ideas about the case.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  Indeed I do.<br/><br/>ABBERLINE:  Why don't you come into my office, then?<br/><br/><i>They walk to HIGHGRASS'S office. Some ARTIFICERS are scraping HIGHGRASS'S name off the door and painting ABBERLINE'S name on it. As he enters, AUBREY shoots HIGHGRASS a look of sympathy. HIGHGRASS mouths "good luck" at AUBREY as he closes the door behind them.</i><br/><br/><b>INT. ABBERLINE'S OFFICE \x90\u2014 DAY</b><br/><br/><i>AUBREY is seated across a desk from ABBERLINE, who reclines in his seat looking extremely comfortable.</i><br/><br/>ABBERLINE:  Now, Mr. Matchington, please go ahead.<br/><br/><i>AUBREY pulls out once again his large sheaf of notes.</i><br/><br/>AUBREY:  I am \x90\u2014 by avocation, at least \x90\u2014 as you may have heard, a phrenologist. As Detective Chief Inspector Highgrass mentioned, I have studied the corpses and other evidence related to this particular investigation, and I do have some theories concerning the nature of the individual responsible \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>ABBERLINE:  Yes, Nelson briefed me on all this, told me about your notes there. And to that, I say: bollocks.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  (Taken aback):  Oh? Do explain.<br/><br/>ABBERLINE:  Twenty years I been a detective on the Met. Twenty years. The way you catch a criminal, Mr. Matchington, is you catch him in the commission of his criminal act, or you catch his accomplices. Your little amateur day book report does not interest me in the slightest. Because you, sir, have the look of another soft, poncey Oxford boy who thinks he can come down and explain to the police how they do their business.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  Inspector Abberline, I have not the slightest idea of how to do your business, nor in fact do I care to. However, I would ask you whether in fact you have encountered anything like this in your twenty years of policing \x90\u2014 that is to say, whether you have encountered creatures who accost prostitutes in order to cut out their generative organs, and if in fact you have, I beg you to enlighten me as to what it is they hoped to accomplish, and how they were found, and indeed what manner of accomplices to this deed they chose to involve?<br/><br/>ABBERLINE:  I did do a little work on the torso murders in '84 and '87, and I've seen my share of bodies blown up by Fenian bombs. So if it's about the gore, I've got that covered, thank you very much. Sir.<br/><br/><i>[Aaand we go to the mechanics! Aubrey's intent is basically to cow and convince Abberline with his native intelligence to get police approval and support for his interviews--including clearing away the toughs watching Rivka's place.<br/><br/>Aubrey's pool was Glory d10 (The world will see that I am right), Genius d12, and Highgrass d10 (the fight the good fight part--not the imbecile part.)<br/><br/>I hadn't really filled out Abberline yet but I quickly gave him Willful d10, Truth d10 (I will get to the bottom of this!), Highgrass d10 (Does what I say) and also rolled The Met 2d8 to represent his position of authority. Aubrey got a 22, easily beating Abberline's 17. I could have pulled in both dice from The Met, but decided that it was more interesting to have Abberline Stress Out while also taking Shamed stress (Shamed was AP's idea; my initial instinct was Frustrated, but he was right.) Abberline ended up with d10 Shamed stress.]</i><br/><br/>ABBERLINE (CONT'D):  Now get the bloody hell out of my office!<br/><br/><i>ABBERLINE grabs AUBREY and half-carries, half-shoves him out the door. AUBREY'S sheaf of papers scatters.</i><br/><br/>ABBERLINE (CONT'D):  You think I don't know how to run an investigation? I'll show you how to run an investigation! Nelson, get this man out of my station, d'ye understand?<br/><br/><i>The entire station house watches in shocked fascination as AUBREY is pushed through the room. HIGHGRASS intercepts him near the door and grabs TC MILLER, who is chalk-white with fear, as well.</i><br/><br/>HIGHGRASS:  Look, just take Miller and see what you can find out. I'll take care of Fred.<br/><br/><i>[The result of the contest was that Aubrey wasn't kicked off the investigation, officially, although he did make an enemy of Abberline.<br/><br/>We also decided that Aubrey deserved a d6 Relationship with Abberline--probably I should have charged a plot point, but it seemed too good to not have it in there--and could add TC Miller as a 2d4 Extra (Constables, Information)<br/><br/>At this point in the session, we worked out the incidents that led to Dinah's incarceration at St. Thomas'. Dinah had gone to Daisy for an abortion; some complication set in (possibly just post-partum depression) that led, unbeknownst to Daisy, to Dinah being committed at the asylum. She learned about it from Aubrey, who casually mentioned in conversation one day that he was treating a woman of Dinah's description. At some time after that, Rivka bribed the administration of St. Thomas' to let her take Dinah away. She's still paying them off, although Aubrey has become aware that Dinah is no longer in the hospital.]</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439716/#Comment_439716" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-27T16:14:32+00:00" title="October 27, 2014  4:14PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EPISODE 2: Fortune Was Not Kind in this World (Part 6)</b><br/><br/><b>INT.

RIVKA'S ROOM \x90\u2014 EVENING</b><br/><br/>RIVKA:  Mr. Tadeusz, you can't have seen Dinah for a long time.<br/><br/>JAN:  It's been three or four years, since she left Krakow. I have been working as a sailor, because the Russians are very, very cruel to us. One day we will free Poland from the Russians. Today is not that day. But it was why I had to leave Poland \x90\u2014 I was a revolutionary. I have heard you take care of people, that you take care of Dinah.<br/><br/><i>[Fun fact: Jules Verne's original vision of Captain Nemo was that he was a Polish nobleman fighting against the Russians. His editor made him trim all explicit references to the Polish nationality of Nemo (Russia was an important ally of France.) Later, of course, in The Mysterious Isle, we discover Nemo to have been Indian. But then again, the timelines of those two books really don't work together at all...so maybe there were two Nemos\u2026]</i><br/><br/>RIVKA:  Have some soda bread. You say you were engaged to her, but she came here years ago?<br/><br/>JAN:  We both had to leave Poland, and of course her family was not happy about her marrying me because I am a Christian.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  I understand. So you haven't seen her since then, and you are looking for her?<br/><br/>JAN:  Yes, I work on boats. I am cattle drover for British ships. I bring cattle on ships, and we bring them to England.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  So you're working on a ship right now, yes? Good. I have to tell you \u2026 have you talked to anyone else about Dinah?<br/><br/>JAN:  I know she has been ill. She was ill a few times in Krakow before we left. But she was always better when I was around.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  I will tell you a little. It's like this: she was ill. She was taken to a place that tries to treat people who are ill, but it wasn't a very good place. The good news is that she's not there anymore. I mean, I've heard she isn't there anymore. I can try to find word for you of where she is. But you need to be cautious about this, because the bad place is still looking for her.<br/><br/>JAN:  I swear to you, Miss Solomon, I will never allow the bad place to get Dinah again. I want to take her with me to America. I apologize for intruding on your holiday evening.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  It's all right, a friend of Dinah's is always welcome here. I will try to find out about Dinah's whereabouts \u2026 can you come back in an three hours? Oh, why were you standing outside our house?<br/><br/>JAN:  I wanted to come in, but I was afraid.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  You don't happen to know John Pizer?<br/><br/>JAN:  No. The Leather Apron man? I have heard of him. <br/><br/>RIVKA:  We were frightened because we think that bad men are watching our building, so when we saw you \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>JAN:  Ah, of course.

Johnny went with Kathleen (Will be my bride yet) d10 and Love d10. KP got an 11, but Johnny managed to sneak through with a 12. This resulted in a d10 of Frustrated stress.

I remember seeing you there, madam.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Yes. I was trying to get arrested, I take it you were not. <br/><br/>THOMAS:  Yes, ma'am. I wasn't trying to do anything, I just got swept up.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  (Crossly.):  You were trying to do something. You were trying to keep somebody out of gaol.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  Aye, and I did, I did. I kept \x90\u2014 that person \x90\u2014 out of trouble.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  My father's very non-political. He's got a sterling reputation at home, everyone in the village knew he's the one to go to if you've troubles, he's the one to go for advice.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  Aye, them's the days, but them days is past, Kathleen.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  My father's the kindest, gentlest, most God-fearing man you'd ever meet anywhere, and the idea that he should be confined in a place like this, coughing up his lungs, being fed God knows what \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>THOMAS:  Now, now, there's no help for it in this vale of tears, Kathleen.

I remember all them Special Branch, and them dragoons. Saw a policeman there, what always had it in for the Fenians.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Who? Do you remember his name?<br/><br/>THOMAS:  Inspector Abberline.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  There wasn't a particle of evidence against him, except that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  Ah, well, so it ever 'tis, between Englishmen and Irishmen. <br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  It isn't right! <br/><br/><i>DAISY looks nervously about, clearly deeply moved but already aware of the fearsome social cost involvement in the affair would entail.</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN (CONT'D.):  So, da, I was thinking that perhaps the right thing to do, and perhaps Mrs. de Lanc\xe9 could help us, would be to find some upstanding Englishmen who would be willing to sign themselves to a letter avowing to your good character.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  That couldn't hurt. But don't bide your head too much about it, Kathleen. Your future's not in this country. You should go to America, where an Irishman can walk with respect. <br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  I'm not going anywhere now. I'm not going anywhere when Mother and the bairns are in Ireland.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  I was hoping that you and Johnny would earn enough that you could take 'em all with you.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  Father, I wish to speak to you about Johnny.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  What about Johnny?<br/><br/><i>DAISY politely slips away and begins examining the medical supplies held in the infirmary.<br/></i><br/>KATHLEEN:  I know that all that you want is for me to be happy \x90\u2014 and I know that you think the world of Johnny \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>THOMAS:  He has his flaws. He needs a good woman to straighten him out.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  I think that his flaws are greater than you know.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  What are you saying, Kathleen?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  Well, for one thing, I believe he's a thief.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  Kathleen!<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  He boasted about it to me. He's running around with a bad sort and he doesn't have the moral character to stand up to them.<br/><br/>THOMAS:  He's not the first Irishman who's had to steal to live in this Englishman's world.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  For another thing, he frequents houses of ill repute! <br/><br/><i>[Me: Like the one I live in!<br/><br/>At this point we put together a pool.

In looking back, maybe Thomas wasn't the precise relationship, but metaphorically she was freeing Thomas of his misconceptions.<br/><br/>KP got a 7, I got a 13.

I'm thinking of some hare-brained plans \u2026 like having a fabulous party where in order to get in you'd have to sign the petition! It would be all about the differences between the Astors and the Vanderbilts.<br/><br/><i>[Me: I'm pretty sure Kathleen is thinking, White People Problems.]</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  Ma'am?<br/><br/>DAISY:  The Astors and Vanderbilts are New York families. The Astors are old money and conservative, the Vanderbilts are new money and more progressive. Mrs. Astor cut Mrs. Vanderbilt at parties all the time \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  With a knife?<br/><br/>DAISY:  No, socially! And they wouldn't invite each other to anything anymore, that sort of thing!<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  Oh, I see. That must be dreadful.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Until one day Mrs. Vanderbilt threw the most amazing party! She decorated her apartments to look like Louis Quatorze's salon at Versailles! Or was that Mrs. Schen \x90\u2014 I can never remember her name, she lives on Lafayette Street. And Mrs. Astor's daughter wanted to go, but she couldn't get an invitation, because her mother had snubbed Mrs. Vanderbilt so many times, until finally Mrs. Astor had to make advances to Mrs. Vanderbilt and I really wish I could do something of the kind with this awful English society, although I'm not sure I have the right qualities, frankly. Mrs. Vanderbilt is an awfully impressive woman. And I'm not nearly at that level yet. I don't have nearly enough money.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  So \x90\u2014 you want to have a party \x90\u2014 a really large party \x90\u2014 and people will sign the petition in order to go?<br/><br/>DAISY:  I want to find a way to solve this that is not quite as ridiculous. Because I am well aware, although I wish I wasn't, that some of my ideas are ridiculous. I could get some people to sign, but I don't think it would be enough. What if I could get Inspector Abberline to sign? That must help. We could present the petition to him.

JOHNNY is standing there, wearing his Sunday suit, with JAN standing next to him in a suit that looks new-bought, holding a bunch of flowers. JOHNNY bustles into the parlour, dragging JAN. Behind them a coterie of WHITECHAPEL LOCALS tramp in, carrying trays of food, candles, more flowers, and the makings of a trestle table and service for several people. Among the crowd is MARIE, although she mostly goes unnoticed.</i><br/><br/>JOHNNY:  Never to fear, me loves! I took young Teddy around and introduced him to everyone at the Cauldron \x90\u2014 we're tight now, we're all looking out for Teddy. Oh, and I even got him one of these skullcappy things.

The crowd parts and AUBREY catches sight of DINAH.</i><br/><br/>DAISY:  Mr. Matchington! Have you come slumming too! Finn's out at the club, I came down here with Kathleen and blundered into this party! It's Rosh Hashanah, have you heard of it? It's the Jewish New Year, you know, because of the new moon. The music's Irish, I'm sure you know that, and I guess the food's mostly not Jewish, but the spirit's the same, really! Don't you think so? It certainly feels different than any party I've been to recently. Isn't it marvelous?<br/><br/>AUBREY:  I was not aware of the party, I was not invited, and I am sorry to have disturbed the festivities. I am here as you expect in a consultative capacity, but I sense that while time is of the essence that this may be a sufficiently bad time for these purposes \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>JOHNNY:  (Passing by.):  You just got here!

No, this is someone different. You've asked about her before.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  You don't have to talk to me about this, Miss Solomon. I suspect both for your safety and your happiness that you would prefer to believe in plausible alternatives. <br/><br/>RIVKA:  Come upstairs.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  I will. One moment, please.<br/><br/><i>AUBREY strides to the door, opens it, and sticks his head out.

You can see they're still there.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  If I were to stay, as you know, it would be to interview your friends and co-workers. I sincerely hope that if it is necessary for the men outside to be dealt with please inform me and I will have my police escort do what can be done.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  We were threatened by that man Pizer. He was going to beat me in the face with a carpet beater.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  I am very thankful for you, and for the sake of justice and mercy in the abstract, that it did not come to pass. And I am sorry that you labour under these burdens as a general matter. I assume you did not summon me upstairs on this matter.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  No. Why did you ask me about the woman downstairs?<br/><br/>AUBREY:  I don't know how much you know about this woman, Miss Solomon. She is sick, and she is certainly a danger to herself and, although I strongly suspect her powers in this regard to be limited, I strongly suspect that she is a danger to those she encounters. I worry for her, and more I worry for you if you are harbouring her. She needs care of a very specialized variety, and she needs treatment. In some sense it is not my concern, I am not an orderly at St. Thomas', but I one who flatters himself in having a generalized interest in the well-being of more wretched creatures \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>RIVKA:  So in order to protect her well-being \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>AUBREY:  Hers and yours \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>RIVKA:  You wish her to be at St. Thomas'?<br/><br/>AUBREY:  You have raised it admirably.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  Have you been there?<br/><br/>AUBREY:  I have. <br/><br/>RIVKA:  It didn't seem that people there were being treated in a way that would improve their well-being.<br/><br/>AUBREY:  We try, Miss Solomon. Our tools are imperfect and our knowledge yet more imperfect. We labour mightily to know what we can of the mind so we may heal its frailties more convincingly.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  Beatings? Binding people to beds? Starving people? Chaining them to walls? All for their well-being? At least you had the courtesy to say that if the man with the carpet beater had hit me that would have been unfortunate. But you wish for others to be beaten?<br/><br/>AUBREY:  If that will cure them, then yes that is what I wish. And moreover, if no cure is possible \x90\u2014 and I sincerely hope that is not the case for Dinah \x90\u2014 I wish that those who are mad and dangerously so should not be in a position to where they could wreak harm to those around them.<br/><br/><i>[And another contest. Rivka's on the assault, trying to convince Aubrey to not take away Dinah. RP went with Dinah d8, Duty d8, and Big-Hearted d10. AP put together Duty d8, Connected d8, and then spent a Plot Point to gain a d8 relationship with Dinah \x90\u2014 nice! Aubrey got an 8 (with a Complication I promptly bought) and Rivka came up with 12, inflicting Stress on Aubrey. This came up d8 Frightened \x90\u2014 that was AP's idea, and fit perfectly with his relationship with Rivka. I pointed out that AP could give in to avoid the Stress, but it would mean that he was agreeing with Rivka that Dinah doesn't belong in the asylum.]</i><br/><br/>AUBREY (CONT'D.):  I'm not going to ruin your festivities, Miss Solomon. Since I am here to save you and yours from violence and death, I will not begin this phase of our association by making myself a spectre of terror. But I want you to know that I have seen Dinah in St. Thomas', where she was being kept, and have spoken with her. I urge you, if you cannot be persuaded to put her in the care of the authorities who are suited to the task, then to look to your own safety. I will return soon with my men.<br/><br/><b>INT.

Do have someplace they could hide?<br/><br/>JOHNNY:  Aye, I know a man who knows a place. Don't worry, the coppers will never find it. That posh git will never find it. If you want her never to be found, I can make it happen.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  That's very good of you, Johnny. We'll have to get them out of London eventually.<br/><br/>JOHNNY:  Aye, if he gets enough money he can take Dinah to America. I can see about helping him with that.<br/><br/>RIVKA:  You're very helpful.<br/><br/>JOHNNY:  Thank you, Becky. If you could put in a good word for me with Kathleen I'd appreciate it.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  You should go to America, Johnny.<br/><br/>JOHNNY:  We should both go.

Is it helping? I've punch pillows myself. Is everything all right? I'm guessing it's not, but is everything all right in a way that you're comfortable talking about?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  It's just \x90\u2014 my father has the patience of a saint. And believes the best of everyone. Including that lout out there. He even wants me to marry him.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Which one?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  The lout. Didn't I say?<br/><br/>DAISY:  There are several gentlemen out there who could match that description. <br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  He's the one that got my father locked up in the first place.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Oh, the one your father was trying to help. <br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  The most frustrating thing about it is his complete indifference to my refusal to marry him! It's completely unsupportable!<br/><br/>DAISY:  That must be very frustrating indeed. I had a few suitors like that. Mostly I put frogs in their beds.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  But my father expects me to take care of him, you see. He reproaches me for not being kinder to Johnny.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Well, that's a dilemma. My father wasn't very kind to anybody. It certainly didn't bother him when I put frogs in the beds of suitors.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  My father has it in his head that a good woman will make him better. But I shouldn't like to marry anyone I didn't admire. And I despise him! I mean, of course \u2026 he does mean well \x90\u2014 sometimes.<br/><br/>DAISY:  Lots of people mean well sometimes. <br/><br/>KATHLEEN:  He was certainly very nice to that couple. I just wish it didn't have to be tonight for him to be nice. <br/><br/>DAISY:  It's certainly harder when they're nice some of the time. It makes it harder to properly hate them. My mother says my father was that way once. Have I ever told you about how he was an admiral for twenty hours?

Plus, we had the impromptu Rosh Hashanah celebration, which was simply lovely.<br/><br/>I came up with Jan based on DP's notes to me that Dinah had so far only functioned as a Madwoman Spouting Prophecy, so I wanted to give her a little more dramatic oomph. I realized at some point that I could also use the introduction of Jan to humanize Johnny, who had been a little too much of a jerk to justify Thomas' faith in him during the first session.<br/><br/>Annie Chapman's death as presented is one of the more plausible reconstructions. There are issues with the timing of the workingman's recollections--according to him, he heard the thump and woman crying "No!" <i>before</i> Annie was observed talking to a man near 29 Hansbury Street, but exact measurement of time was pretty difficult in those days. I gave Kathleen the job of having inadvertently walked by the Ripper--obviously, this was a different person in the real course of events, although she is almost certainly the person who came closest to the Ripper. Sadly, she was not able to come up with a definitive description (and in fact her recollection is somewhat at odds with our best composite portrait of the Whitechapel murderer.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439751/#Comment_439751" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-28T20:48:02+00:00" title="October 28, 2014  8:48PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lovely stuff: a great write-up, enjoyable to read as fiction, and great to have all the mechanical notes in there, as well.

Unbelievably enough, I rolled a couple of Opportunities (the group declined to buy out my 2d6), and Aubrey managed to beat the roll. I asked if he wanted to turn the Contest around and attempt to stress the Ripper \x90\u2014 this was kind of metaphorical, but it seemed pretty interesting, and possible depending on how Aubrey managed to talk to the police. AP also wanted to get into a contest with Abberline, but I decided to resolve the Ripper contest first but have it be the results of Aubrey's profile.<br/><br/>KP asked if Aubrey can indeed use Genius given that phrenology doesn't work, but I pointed out he was a Genius despite his beliefs. The pool was Genius d12, Glory d8, and Abberline d6, plus a plot point to include Wealthy d10. I think I went with Glory d8, the Met d8, and Whitechapel 2d8. Aubrey rolled a complication but got a 19; I bought the complication, and had to burn the Ripper's Whitechapel resource to keep him from stressing out.

It's multi-part and probably complicated.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Tell me everything.<br/><br/>DAISY: I've got friends in the Socialists. Don't tell Lady Snottington or any of Lady Snottington's friends \x90\u2014 they're not supposed to know. They probably already know \x90\u2014 they know everything \x90\u2014 but we don't mention it in polite company something something something. I plan to get your father to tell me about other innocent Irish men, ones who aren't Fenians, because if we get any Fenians then everything's ruined. Once we get the list, we go to the Socialists with it, because they like causes, and justice, and this is a just one. And there's really nothing else to work on right now. <br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Begging your pardon, but will Socialists care about Irishmen?<br/><br/>DAISY: Oh, yes. There are plenty of Irish Socialists.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Oh. Irish Socialists\u2026<br/><br/>DAISY: Socialists are an international organization! They have plenty of Irish people, and Polish\u2026 African\u2026 <br/><br/>KATHLEEN: So Irish Socialists.<br/><br/>DAISY: Yes, Irish Socialists. Also the other kinds of Socialists.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: But they wouldn't care.<br/><br/>DAISY: They will care! It's for the cause of justice! In England! Which is \x90\u2014<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Irishmen.<br/><br/>DAISY: Anyway, we'll get the Socialists to care about us. Then I'm going to write an editorial \x90\u2014 and I write fairly well, because my father thought I should learn, and it's been very handy. Then I'll find some gentleman and publish it under his name, because they'll never let me publish it under my own.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Why would he let you publish it under his name?<br/><br/>DAISY: Because he likes me, that's usually how this goes. And it will be all sorts of conservative and be about how if England wants to maintain its reputation for law and order it can't go around jailing people unjustly. Which it can, but you can say it can't in an editorial. And then I'll start making noise about it as myself. This is called manufacturing consensus and we're going to do it, and then likely someone will decide \x90\u2014 if we've manufactured consensus correctly \x90\u2014 that this is a popular cause and they have to do it. Because it's neither monetarily nor politically possible to release your father and those others who were sentenced.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: They are Irish though.<br/><br/>DAISY: They are Irish. But people do political calculations that end up doing moderately all right  things for the Irish all the time. They don't like it, but they do it.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: But whom will they be trying to please? The Irish Socialists? Or the gentleman who obliges you by publishing the conservative editorial?<br/><br/>DAISY: So probably it will be something like we must court the conservative elite and also not give the Socialists ammunition and then there's this calculus. I'm probably the least important part of the mix, but I hope to help manufacture consensus by being the liberal progressive woman who says these things, as opposed to that conservative guy who published this editorial and those Irish Socialists over there.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Very well. What can I do?<br/><br/>DAISY: First of all, I could use you asking your father about other Irishmen in jail who are innocent and are agreeable like he is and who are not Fenians. They need to be sort of model people like he is. And they can't be Fenians, or guilty, or we're sunk. Or Socialists, who are always scapegoats.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN seems to be pondering people she knows and mentally crossing names off the list.<br/><br/>DAISY: And I'll go looking for a stalking horse, or a cat's paw \x90\u2014 I can never remember which one it is. The sort of person who would publish an editorial not written by him under his name. Probably a Conservative. God, I hate Conservatives, but they always seem charmed by me.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: What must I do after I have the names?<br/><br/>DAISY: Well, if you want to go to the Socialist hall with me, I can surely take you. I have absolutely no idea how you feel about them. I quite like them.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Do they leave honest women alone?<br/><br/>DAISY: That depends on the Socialist. They do tend to be very principled, so they have that. Some are interested in Free Love, but you just have to give them a swift kick in the balls and tell them you're not interested.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: <i>(Involuntarily grinning.)</i><br/>All right then!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440673/#Comment_440673" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T16:44:24+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  4:44PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2014 4:44PM by Aviatrix.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode 3: Dark Is Life... (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>INT. HANBURY STREET BOARDINGHOUSE PARLOUR \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>RIVKA is sitting with some of her housemates. There is a knock on the door; RIVKA opens it to find FINNEGAN and LEAH standing on the stoop.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA <i>(To Leah.)</i>: Hello, darling. What are you doing here?<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Hello, Rivka. I was wondering, if you weren't doing anything, I thought maybe we could all go out \x90\u2014 you could have some time with Leah, we could go to the park\u2026 <br/><br/>RIVKA: Let me go change.<br/><br/>INT. HANSOM CAB \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>RIVKA has changed into her best dress and is sitting with FINNEGAN and LEAH.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: How are your piano lessons coming, darling?<br/><br/>LEAH: Good. I can play "Twinkle, twinkle little star" but teacher says it's really called "Oh vous dirai-je maman".<br/><br/><i>[The French name of the tune Anglophones call "Twinkle, twinkle little star\u2026" Mozart wrote a series of variations on it.]</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: That's very sophisticated. <br/><br/>FINNEGAN: She's very talented. Have you eaten? I'm sure \x90\u2014 I'm sure we could find someplace\u2026 <br/><br/>RIVKA: I've eaten a little, I suppose that we could\u2026 Simon, the only thing I'm worried about\u2026 I suppose we could get some bread and cheese.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Ah, like I used to do in Paris when we would go to the Bois de Boulogne. Bit cold for it today, but a capital idea. Driver!<br/><br/>The cab makes a quick stop at a shop and FINNEGAN jumps out, runs into the shop, and quickly returns with several bundles and a few bottles of wine.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: So what do you say, head to Hyde Park? Or the Thames Embankment?<br/><br/>RIVKA: Those seem rather\u2026 public\u2026 <br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Oh\u2026 of course. I know just the place, it's in Chelsea. Driver!<br/><br/><i>[In-session I said Islington; London geography fail. Chelsea as the "borough of artists" makes much more sense.]</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: Simon\u2026 have you told Mrs. De Lanc\xe9 about this outing?<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: I told her I was taking Leah to see you, yes.<br/><br/>RIVKA: My concern is that people might wonder why I'm out with you and her daughter.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Well\u2026 I would like to say, "damn their eyes for their impudence", but I can see where it would be a concern. This place we're going is very discreet, there's a little room in the back and no one will see us.<br/><br/>INT. THE BACK ROOM OF AN ENGLISH ROADSIDE RESTAURANT \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>RIVKA and FINNEGAN are sitting in a quiet room for two. LEAH sits by the fire, playing with a doll.</i><br/><br/>FINNEGAN: I'm sorry, Rivka, I suppose you probably think this is all very unusual. It's just that\u2026 I really wanted to see you\u2026 it's not that I don't care about you and Leah in your own way\u2026 Daisy's wonderful but\u2026 my life is extremely complicated now\u2026 I don't think I'm making any sense, damnit. Damnit, now I'm an Austen hero!<br/><br/><i>[RP: Well, Rivka hasn't read those books anyway.<br/>Me: Yeah, and you'd probably have to half-translate them into Yiddish to understand them.<br/>RP: Are we having this conversation in English or Yiddish?<br/>Me: English. Finn probably doesn't speak Yiddish well or at all.<br/>KP: But he feels guilty about not speaking Yiddish!<br/>Me: Yes! Well, he feels guilty about everything\u2026]</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: I'm sorry that your life is stressful. I think you're doing a very good job.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: I'm just sorry you don't get to see Leah\u2026 and I don't get to see you as much\u2026 as much as any of us would care\u2026 <br/><br/>RIVKA: I'm always happy to see Leah, but I wouldn't want to do anything to keep her from her mother.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: You're her mother.<br/><br/>RIVKA: But that isn't any good for her. The things that you and Mrs. De Lanc\xe9 can give to her are better than the things I can give to her, which is why she's your daughter.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Well, that's not fair either, is it?<br/><br/>RIVKA: No\u2026 but the person I care about the most in all of this is Leah. I want what's best for her.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Don't you understand, Rivka, I haven't done well by you. <br/><br/>RIVKA: You've done immeasurably better by me than I had any reason to suspect anyone ever would. You and Daisy both.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: What are you saying?<br/><br/>RIVKA: What I'm saying is that a woman in the position I was in six years ago had no expectation of any help whatsoever. Your wife's hobbies are sort of an acknowledgement of that.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Yes\u2026 I just don't\u2026 want to face a world where I can't see you anymore, Rivka.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Simon, you can see me. I'm right here. I just don't want to do anything that would jeopardize Leah's relationship with her mother, or her father. Or her mother's relationship with her father.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: Yes, we must keep up appearances, musn't we.<br/><br/><i>[So we went to a roll, but it was hard to decide who was stressing who. I decided to do a pool where Finn was stressing Rivka to keep seeing him, and either that would get turned around or we'd do a second contest. (I also realized what one of Finn's d8s was: Love (I am torn between two women). The pool was Love d8, Likable d8, and Rivka (I've wronged you) d8. Rivka went with Duty d8, Leah d10, and Not Born Yesterday d4. This ended up with Finn winning 13-12, and inflicting d8 Shamed stress.]</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: Simon, we both want whatever's best for everyone involved in this. And I think what's best for everyone is\x90 \u2014 when we see each other alone, or alone with Leah here\x90 \u2014 it isn't going to be the best thing for everyone. And it's going to cause problems between you and Mrs. De Lanc\xe9.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: I don't ever want to hurt her. I mean, I love Daisy \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>RIVKA: Of course you do. And she's Leah's mother\u2026 and we don't want to do anything to hurt us all down the line.<br/><br/>FINNEGAN: My God, what have I done?<br/><br/>RIVKA: No, Simon! Simon, we're all on the same side here! We all want the same thing, and we all want to do the things that will get us what we want. If you want to see me \x90\u2014 look, you are an important person to me, you and Mrs. De Lanc\xe9 are Leah's parents and are important people to me. I have a debt I cannot ever satisfy. If the two of you wish me to visit both of you and Leah, I would do that whenever you wished. And that would work out well for everyone.<br/><br/><i>[We decided to put together a pool. KP wondered if Finn could roll against himself (if anyone can, he could), and I wanted to see what stress Finn took. I gave RP a d6 as part of his Guilty pool, then rolled Duty, Guilty, and Rivka. Finn still managed to win and avoid stress.]</i><br/><br/>FINNEGAN: You're right, I've been so foolish.

A large CROWD has gathered in the road, moving against the direction the cab is traveling \x90\u2014 towards Leman Street, in point of fact. Voices in the CROWD ring out:</i><br/><br/>CROWD:  They've got him! They've picked him up! They pinched Leather Apron!<br/><br/>INT. THE DE LANCE TOWNHOUSE PARLOUR \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>DAISY is walking KATHLEEN toward the door.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: I suppose I should explain Socialism to you. How many Socialists have you talked to?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: How would I know if they're Socialists?<br/><br/>DAISY: You've heard about Socialism, right?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: I've heard\u2026 Socialists believe people shouldn't stick to their place.<br/><br/>DAISY: The world is, terrible, you know that, right? I mean \x90\u2014 you were at the Jewish New Year celebration, right?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: The Jews celebrating New Year's is the problem? It is a mighty strange celebration \x90\u2014 they blow a loud horn, but I don't think that they're worshipping the Devil in my experience.<br/><br/>DAISY: I mean \x90\u2014 it's not the Jews at all \x90\u2014 everything's terrible, and the Socialists are trying to do something to stop it! The world is awful and somebody, somewhere should do something to fix it!<br/><br/><i>[Me: Somewhere Karl Marx begins banging his head on a desk. (Well, spinning in his tomb; he was dead in 1888.)]</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN: What aspects of the world being awful are the Socialists trying to remedy?<br/><br/>DAISY: I mean, you have injustices like what happened to your father, where arbitrary Irishmen are put in gaol because they're arbitrarily Irish \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Well, if that's what Socialism is about, then I know lots of Socialists.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Soda bread Socialists!]</i><br/><br/>DAISY: And there's workers being paid awful wages to do horrible, dangerous work! And women like Rivka forced to become prostitutes! And England's great! They've got resources so that nobody should live like that! Nobody should have to live with rats!<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: So Socialists are against the rats. Rats are indeed very inconvenient.<br/><br/>DAISY: They're about the redistribution of wealth and power!<br/><br/><i>[Me: This really is Daisy's understanding of Socialism, isn't it? "Socialism is good! That's why I believe in it! What? No, I wouldn't give up my servant, why do you ask?"]</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Redistributing how?<br/><br/>DAISY: By getting laws passed so that things like arbitrary Irishmen aren't in prison and people get paid better wages. I suppose the rich get taxed more \x90\u2014 my father would grumble about that \x90\u2014 but I don't do my own taxes anyway so that hardly affects me.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Well, that all sounds very nice \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>DAISY: And it's an international movement, so there's Irish Socialists, there are even Socialists who aren't Irish who are against the arbitrary imprisonment of Irishmen. Because it's an affront to justice in the world. I mean, I'm American and you still talk to me, and would try to get me out of gaol at least a little bit if I was put there.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: I'd try to get you out of gaol. I don't know if I'd be any good at it \x90\u2014 I don't know very much about the world, if you say it is horrible and the Socialists are trying to make it better that sounds all right.<br/><br/><i>[I had Daisy put together a pool to see how much she may have stressed out Kathleen with her plans. Daisy used Justice, Kathleen, and Manipulative, plus a 2d4 from the Hanbury Street Boardinghouse (to help illustrate Socialist principles). She also spent a plot point to add Willful. This resulted in Stress for Kathleen \x90\u2014 d10 Frustrated. Daisy also rolled a complication which I picked up as "Kathleen doesn't trust Socialists d6" for later use. I'm not sure that's exactly how the rules work, but it seemed like a better use of the 1. KP said Kathleen's understanding of all this was, "Socialists think the world is horrible; Kathleen doesn't understand how the world is horrible for Daisy. And Socialists are against rats."]</i><br/><br/>INT. LEMAN STREET POLICE STATION \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>AUBREY is talking with a group of CONDESCENDING DETECTIVES who are "instructing" him in the basics of police methods. The doors open and SERGEANT THICKE leads JOHN PIZER into the station. Outside the clamour of a crowd can be heard.</i><br/><br/>ABBERLINE steps out of his office and observes THICKE and PIZER.<br/><br/>ABBERLINE: Oh, God. Aubrey! Could you come over and help with the interrogation of this Pizer? You wanted to learn police work, right?<br/><br/>AUBREY: But Detective Chief Inspector, I don't know anything about police work!<br/><br/>ABBERLINE: Never fear, we'll show you how it's done!<br/><br/>INT.

From police, from people. My brother was there.<br/><br/>ABBERLINE shakes his head, looking at THICKE, who shrinks away from his chief's glare.<br/><br/>ABBERLINE: So you say you have a profile, Matchington?<br/><br/>AUBREY: Indeed I do, but first I'd like to demonstrate a certain fact I've learned about proper police work. Mr. Pizer, we recently found the corpse of a woman behind a boardinghouse of ill repute on Hanbury Street. Let me show you the autopsy photographs.<br/><br/><i>PIZER turns pale.</i><br/><br/>PIZER:  That \x90\u2014 that is horrible! That should not happen to anyone, especially not a woman.<br/><br/>AUBREY: My way is faster.<br/><br/>ABBERLINE: We'll hold him for a few days anyway. Take him down to holding, boys. Gently, gently.<br/><br/>INT. LEMAN STREET POLICE STATION \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>As AUBREY comes out of the interrogation room, he notices a rather comely Irish prostitute standing by the front desk.

I'm going to ask you several questions, this may be a lengthy interview \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>MARIE: Aye, if it's going to be that long, maybe we could have something to drink?<br/><br/>AUBREY: If you get thirsty, I'm sure water could be arranged \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>MARIE: Water? That'll rust your insides!

AN INTERROGATION ROOM IN LEMAN STREET STATION \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>MILLER, MARIE, and AUBREY are seated at a table.</i><br/><br/>AUBREY: Before I get to specific questions, I do have one extremely broad question because frankly I must defer to you own expertise before I begin with my own. As you have undoubtedly heard by this point, the murders that have been occurring in Whitechapel amongst members of your profession are disturbing and gruesome and not at all the kind of affairs that are conducted by conventional criminals for conventional reasons. Now I know you do not purport to know very much about this sort of thing \x90\u2014 and I don't expect you to \x90\u2014 but I must ask you, in the course of your \x90\u2014 forgive me \x90\u2014 extensive experience with men, do you think you have any sense of what kind of person would be likely to be interested in doing something like that in a way that ordinary men would not?<br/><br/>MARIE: Oh, there are some gents what would like to beat you, and you have to charge 'em extra if they tell you up front \x90\u2014 hard to collect after if they've beat you up. A gent with a knife, that's a new one to me. I've heard tales of gals getting their face all cut up by their pimps, but this\u2026 <br/><br/>AUBREY: That would at least be ostensibly for business reasons.<br/><br/>MARIE: You hear about all sorts of things. Me friend Cate has a friend down on Commercial Street and she tells me there's an abortion lady operating thereabout. I mean, it could be a woman, couldn't it?<br/>AUBREY: The murderer?<br/><br/>MARIE: Aye, no one would suspect\u2026 <br/><br/>AUBREY: It's true that no one would suspect, and if I were to hire someone to do this kind of deed I might very well hire a woman of low character. But I have trouble imagining the kind of woman who would have the interest, frankly. Anyway, I want to ask you some questions about the kind of men you encounter whom you say want to beat you.<br/><br/>MARIE: They usually don't beat me! My Joe wouldn't stand for it!<br/><br/>AUBREY: Other women of your acquaintance, then.<br/><br/>MARIE: Aye, now and again you'll hear of some fourpence Sally what got her face kicked in. 'Tis life in Whitechapel, I'd think a man of the world would know that.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I am a man, it turns out, of only certain corners of the world.<br/><br/>MARIE: Well\u2026 that can be remedied, I know some high-class girls. Used to be one meself.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I will take that under advisement. Now, can you tell me about any distinguishing features of these men? Can you tell by observing them if they are the kind who would be taken to commit abuses like the ones that have occurred?<br/><br/>MARIE: I don't know anyone in particular like that \x90\u2014 the kind what would beat a gal's face in. Truth is you can never tell, seems any man is as likely to strike ye as to kiss ye. But maybe you're on the track o' something \x90\u2014 it seems to me that a man like this wouldn't just start with murder. So maybe you should look for cases what are similar but didn't go so far. Anyway, I'll be happy to tell all my friends about what it is you want, and if they know anything they can apply to you. There's a reward, ain't there?<br/><br/>AUBREY: I suppose something of the kind could be arranged, yes.<br/><br/>INT.

THE OFFICE OF JAMES FEATHERSTONE \x90\u2014 MORNING<br/><br/><i>This rather spartan office overlooks the production floor by means of a large window behind the unadorned wooden desk. A large cross hangs on one wall; on the other is a portrait of a rather severe-looking older woman, probably Featherstone's mother. The desk is bare except for a blotter, a pen set, a few folders, and a well-bookmarked Bible. FEATHERSTONE sits behind the desk, leaving KATHLEEN standing in front of it.</i><br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Are you acquainted with a Mrs. Daisy De Lanc\xe9?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Not on duty, sir. On duty I am acquainted only with hats.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Yes, yes. It was a personal question, Miss Ross. It seems this Mrs. De Lanc\xe9 has been asking around the Club for a certain kind of gentleman. One who could assist her in \x90\u2014 well, in helping you, Miss Ross. There's something about your father being in prison.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: My father is in prison, sir.

However, as much as it pains me to say so, I do not do this merely out of charity. I cannot speak to whether your father is justly or injustly held \x90\u2014 I must assume the wheels of justice did not grind him without due course. However, I am willing to allow that the law is fallible and human \x90\u2014 for we are all fallible until we reach the Kingdom of Heaven.<br/><br/><i>(Pauses.)</i><br/><br/>Are you acquainted with Mr. Aubrey Matchingon?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Slightly, sir.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: It seems Mr. Matchington has taken quite an interest in your father.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Yes, sir.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I don't know what opinion you have formed of Mr. Matchington, but my opinion is that he is a meddler and a fool, with a poor moral compass and an inability to understand the necessity of hard work and labor. He was born to his wealth, whereas I and my father had to work our way up. My father started out as a loom-maker in Manchester. It took us thirty years to reach this, but now I own six factories in London, and four mills in Manchester.<br/><br/><i>[AP: How many times has she heard this speech?<br/>Me: Probably quite often.]</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN: That must have taken a great deal of work, sir.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Yes, yes. A man like Matchington would allow the lower classes to simply waste away in idleness under some regime of hygiene that is completely unnecessary and will only damage the productivity of this great nation. But that's above your station, you needn't worry your head about it.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: It certainly sounds above my station, sir.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Which reminds me: let me just say one thing, Miss Ross. If any man under my employ should ever give you any trouble in the slightest, let me know so that I may set about his immediate sacking. This is a Christian firm and we will not allow anything of that sort.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Thank you, sir.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: If you can help me discredit my rival, I would be more than happy to assist you and Mrs. De Lanc\xe9 in putting together a campaign to revisit your father's case. I should mention that I am on rather friendly terms with an undersecretary of state in the Home Office.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Thank you sir. What has Mr. Matchington to his discredit?<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: He insists on publishing his ridiculous papers on the dangers of mercury poisoning and other hazards of the industrial millinery process. They are complete lies and falsehoods \x90\u2014 there's not one iota of scientific proof in them \x90\u2014 yet he insists on writing these papers, and those Liberal idiots in Parliament continue to investigate this matter, and that costs me time and money. Barristers do not come cheap, Miss Ross, as I am sure you are no doubt acquainted.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: That does sound very expensive, sir.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: It is indeed. So if you can find me anything on this Matchington that will help me in my position, I'm sure that I can help with your position.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Thank you, sir. I am bound to say that I am but a lowly hatmaker and it seems to be far greater than my ingenuity to rescue my father from English jail.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Well, Miss Ross, my grandfather was a saddlemaker, my father made looms. You, my dear, I am sure you will be a credit to your race by showing the necessary industry and desire.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: What do you wish him to be found guilty of, sir?<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I don't wish you to commit any crime, my dear. Just find out something that will help me discredit this Matchington. I understand he's mixed up in the Whitechapel investigation; I'm sure he'll sod that up too.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Thank you, sir.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: You'll only be docked for five minutes, even though this meeting has lasted ten. Please return to your station.<br/><br/>INT. AN INTERROGATION ROOM IN LEMAN STREET STATION \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>AUBREY, MILLER and MARIE are concluding the interview.</i><br/><br/>AUBREY: Mrs. Barnett, I told you at the beginning of our conversation that after I made use of your expertise, I was going to acquaint you with mine, and the time has come for that. This is going to be a bit technical, but I do think you will find it possibly lucrative and perhaps beneficial to your safety, so I urge you to pay attention carefully. I am not personally familiar with dangerous men of the type who are capable of the crimes we are discussing; all my knowledge of them is theoretical, and at times troublingly speculative. Be that as it may, I do think that I understand what they are like, and more importantly, how they can be identified in a concrete sense.<br/><br/>MARIE: Sure. We're going to have that drink now?<br/><br/>AUBREY: As soon as I am finished.<br/><br/>AUBREY pulls out a sketchbook and proceeds to draw an image of a the skull of the murderer, according to phrenological science.<br/><br/>AUBREY: As you can see, the sloping forehead indicates a low moral intelligence, and the indentations above the maxillary process indicate his uncontrollable lust\u2026 <br/><br/>MARIE: So you're saying if I can split his head open and see his skull I'll recognize him right away?<br/><br/>AUBREY: I'm saying that on the first hand, if you see men whose cranial features are similar to these, then they are probably dangerous to you, which could be useful information for a woman in your line of work. But more importantly, if you or anyone you know should be in a professional capacity with a man like this, and you should have any reason to think that he is harmful or threatening harm, I encourage you to first absent yourself from the location for your own safety if you can, and second to report your situation to me or to a constable who will bring the information to me.<br/><br/>MARIE: I don't trust no constable, he'll just run me in for solicitation. Or for being Irish, it's one and the same with them.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Have the information sent to me, and I will see to it that you or the person who sends it are rewarded.<br/><br/>MARIE: All right, we can do that.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Excellent. Take this sketch, then.<br/><br/>MARIE: Now we're getting that drink?<br/><br/>AUBREY: And also take this half a crown. I'm afraid I am very pressed at the moment.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440677/#Comment_440677" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T16:51:15+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  4:51PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode 3: Dark Is Life... (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>INT. THE HANBURY STREET BOARDINGHOUSE PARLOUR \x90\u2014 DAY<br/><br/><i>RIVKA greets JOHNNY as he enters the room.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: Good day, Mr. O'Connor.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Becky, good day. I just wanted to let you know that we've settled your Dinah girl and her Teddy. I won't tell you where, they're totally safe and somewhere the coppers will never go.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Thank you, Johnny. You're a good man to take an interest. I hope you don't tell anyone else more than you've told me. Take care of yourself as well. Would you like some bread and cheese, and wine?<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Thank you, don't mind if I do. Thanks! You're very sociable today, Becky.<br/><br/>RIVKA: You're welcome. Did you know that bread other than soda bread existed?<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Well, not in this place I didn't. I mean, I couldn't help but think about poor Teddy. I'd want somebody to help me if poor Kathleen \x90\u2014 if she were in trouble\u2026 is her Da really poorly off?<br/><br/>RIVKA: I hear he has a cough, a bad cough and is being kept in the infirmary with a lot of other people who are very sick.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: He doesn't have the gaol fever? Or the consumption?<br/><br/>RIVKA: It's not clear if he has it yet, but he might well catch it from where he is.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Well, damnit, that's not right, is it?<br/><br/>RIVKA: No, it very much isn't right. <br/><br/>JOHNNY: Is there something I could do to help?<br/><br/>RIVKA: I think the person who will know best is Kathleen.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Aye, but Kathleen will never talk to me about helping her, she hates me.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Well, maybe the next time Kathleen asks you to come to visit her father maybe you would say yes. I think he must care for you a lot, so I'm sure that seeing you would do him a world of good.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: I haven't wanted to go because \x90\u2014 well, Newgate's not the kind of place any Irishman wants to walk into. I tell you what, Becky, the next time she's going to go, please let me know, no matter what. I'll come over and do me best to convince her to take me. And I'll try and help her Da, I don't know if there's anything else I can do \x90\u2014 have you heard anything?<br/><br/>RIVKA: Mr. O'Connor, I understand that it was in part to protect you that Kathleen's father was there in Trafalgar Square?<br/><br/>JOHNNY: 'Tis true, 'tis true \x90\u2014 when they came to get me he got me out in time and then they closed the Square and he couldn't leave. It could have easily been me on the docket, instead of him.<br/><br/>RIVKA: So he's clearly a good man who cares about you a lot \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>JOHNNY: Aye, everyone knows Thomas is the best man in the world \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>KATHLEEN stalks into the room, talking angrily to herself, not noticing JOHNNY.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: How am I supposed to be able to tell who's a Fenian and who isn't?<br/><br/>JOHNNY: You need to know who the Fenians are, Kathleen? It's very easy, I know most of them in London. Half of them are spying for the police, and the other half are spying on them for the Fenians. It's a little complicated, but I could help you out, make you a key\u2026 would you like some wine?<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: No thank you.<br/><br/>RIVKA: It's pretty good wine.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Oh, it's from you? Thank you then.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Mr. O'Connor here was just saying how dreadfully sorry he is that your father was imprisoned on his behalf \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>KATHLEEN: I should bloody well think so!<br/><br/>RIVKA: \x90\u2014 and how very much he'd like to help.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: It's true, Kathleen, anything I can do for Tom, it's me fault for not being a better man to him.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: Yes, it is.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: 'Tis. I admit it.<br/><br/>RIVKA: You were just saying about \x90\u2014 Fenians? I'm not sure even what those are.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Fenians, Becky, are men fighting for Irish independence because they don't think the political process is going to work out for them.<br/><br/>RIVKA: So they're the people who started that riot?<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Well, that was the excuse the British used. It was mostly just Socialists and Trade Unionists.<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: If I can think of any way you can do to help I'll certainly let you know.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Just let me know what your plans are. Or not. I don't mean to \x90\u2014 I just came here to tell Becky that Dinah \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>KATHLEEN: If you're here to see Becky than maybe I should be off!<br/><br/>JOHNNY: I didn't come for that \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>KATHLEEN stalks out of the room.<br/><br/><i>[And we decided to find out if Johnny got stressed; Kathleen had a Duty (to protect her family from Johnny), and a relationship with her Father. Johnny decided to Challenge his relationship with Kathleen\x90\u2014"You will be my bride yet"\u2014in order to avoid Stress. He beat Kathleen 12 to 10, but had to step down his relationship with her.]</i><br/><br/>JOHNNY: Ah, I really screwed the pooch with her, didn't I.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Mr. O'Connor, if I can recommend is that \x90\u2014 I think that the best way you can help right now is\u2026 she has some concern that her father was wrongfully arrested. Not just wrongfully in that he didn't do anything morally wrong, he didn't even do anything anti-British. Whether or not you think that's morally wrong. He didn't actually commit something the British would think is a crime, in addition to not doing something bad. And she's trying to get British people \x90\u2014 who think that various things you don't think of as wrong are crimes \x90\u2014 to understand that he hasn't actually committed those crimes. <br/><br/>JOHNNY: Well, sign me up for that!<br/><br/>RIVKA: It's possible that some of the things that you have done, the British would consider crimes.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: I'm pretty sure of that, aye.<br/><br/>RIVKA: So the problem is that the British she's trying to convince to free her father probably don't want to hear that he's associated with someone who has done things the British consider to be crimes.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: So the only thing I can do to help her is to stay away. That's dreadful, Becky, that's dreadful. I'll have to go and think this over down at the Caldron.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Probably the best thing you can do is to wait until she has a plan, and if she tells you a part of the plan you can help with, then do that. But it's probably not best to improvise. <br/><br/>JOHNNY: I can do that, I think.<br/><br/>RIVKA: You're a good man, Johnny.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Thank you, Becky. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440678/#Comment_440678" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T16:54:02+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  4:54PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode 3: Dark Is Life...

THE XENOPHON CLUB LOUNGE \x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>DAISY, led by the MAITRE D', enters the lounge and goes to a table occupied by JAMES FEATHERSTONE.</i><br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE <i>(Rising and taking DAISY'S hand)</i>: Mrs. De Lanc\xe9. I see you got my note.<br/><br/>DAISY <i>(Sitting down.)</i>: I did. What can I do for you?<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I think it is what I can do for you that is the subject of our conversation. I understand that you would like me to assist you in the matter of Thomas Ross.<br/><br/><i>[We're back on recording from here on out.]</i><br/><br/>DAISY: The British take a great deal of pride in being the most civilized and law-abiding nation in the world but I don't think it would be so easy for them to claim that if they are putting obviously innocent men in gaol. But nobody will listen to me because I'm a woman and an American. I need some help.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: You understand that it is difficult for a man in my position to assist a woman in your position.<br/><br/>DAISY: I don't want you to sleep with me if that's what you mean!<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE <i>(Pales.)</i>: Mrs. De Lanc\xe9! That's vulgar even for an American! <br/><br/>DAISY: Well then I don't know what you were implying.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I meant politically, madam. We are on opposite sides of the issues.<br/><br/>DAISY: Oh, you mean the Tory-Liberal spectrum! But there isn't any difference between your parties \x90\u2014 they're right-wing and more right-wing!<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I am afraid Mr. Gladstone would rather strenuously object to that characterization.<br/><br/>DAISY: Well, piffle to Mr. Gladstone, then!<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: As would Lord Salisbury.<br/><br/>DAISY: Well, piffle him too! <br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Piffle to the Prime Minister, madam?<br/><br/>DAISY: Yes! Piffle to them all, I say!<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: You are clearly trying your utmost to persuade me to your cause, I see.<br/><br/>DAISY: Well? You're about to ask me to do something, I can tell.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I merely point out that it is very difficult for me to assist you because you find the company of Mr. Aubrey Matchington to be socially acceptable. <br/><br/>DAISY: What does Mr. Matchington have to do with it?<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I cannot stand the gentleman, he is my great rival and quite damaging to my interests.<br/><br/>DAISY: You want me to break off my friendship with Mr. Matchington? Look, what I want you to do is to write an editorial, what on Earth does this have to do with Mr. Matchington and how he may or may not be odious? <br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Only my great respect for your father would allow me to even entertain the idea. I cannot give you much hope.<br/><br/>DAISY <i>(Incredulous.)</i>: What? Could you please say that all again? Not actually in the same words, but explain what you want of me. Also, you don't have to speak circuitously to me, because I'm an American and will understand anyway.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I'm not entirely convinced of that, madam. Mr. Matchington is a man who is quite damaging to my interests. It is difficult for me to associate socially with anyone who considers him a friend.<br/><br/>DAISY: I don't need you to associate with me socially! I need you to publish an editorial.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Then I suggest you hire Frederick Engels. Good day, madam.<br/><br/>DAISY: Look, if I broke a friendship with Mr. Matchington \x90\u2014 despite not understanding what this has to do with the unjustly imprisoned Thomas Ross \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I'm afraid, madam, that as you have ventured into the sphere of politics \x90\u2014 which is properly a man's sphere \x90\u2014 you will discover that this is the way things are done. I'm sure your father could explain it to you, he's an excellent man \x90\u2014 I have had the good fortune of meeting him on a number of occasions. <br/><br/>DAISY: Let me be clear. I will certainly break off my friendship with Mr. Matchington to get you to publish an editorial.<br/><br/><i>[DP: Give me a plot point!<br/>(The Manipulative Distinction gets you a plot point when you tell someone to trust you \x90\u2014 even if you don't mean it.]</i><br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Will you, now?<br/><br/>DAISY: Absolutely.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: Madam, I shall entertain the thought. Have your gentleman send over the text of this editorial and I will see what can be done.<br/><br/>DAISY: Very well then.<br/><br/><i>(Pauses.)</i><br/><br/>If I may ask \x90\u2014 purely of a lady's curiosity \x90\u2014 what have you got against Mr. Matchington.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: He is convinced that my methods somehow are deleterious to the populace and especially to my workers, which is completely scientifically unfounded and quite ridiculous, but a man like him, born to ease and wealth, has no idea of what it takes to become a captain of industry.<br/><br/>DAISY: A man born to ease and wealth has no idea how to discover the effects of a poisonous liquid? Interesting.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: No, madam. He does not understand the necessities of business and capital.<br/><br/>DAISY: I'd rather this happen sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I'm sure you do, madam.<br/><br/>DAISY: If it does happen sooner rather than later \x90\u2014 well, I'm only a woman, and one with certain leanings at that. But Aubrey is himself a most peculiar man, and peculiar people sometimes gain wind of each other's peculiarities.<br/><br/>FEATHERSTONE: I see. Well, in that eventuality, I'm sure my barrister and my man of business would intercept any nasty rumours. And in turn, madam, one hears all sorts of stories about you.<br/><br/><i>["Let's roll!"

DAISY is wearing a veil and a plain black shirtwaist \x90\u2014 her normal disguise for these events. KATHLEEN is wearing her Sunday dress and looking around suspiciously at the Socialists. DAISY is complaining in her rapid-fire fashion about the awfulness of her encounter with FEATHERSTONE.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: \x90\u2014 such a horrible man! I can't believe I have to work with him! I can't believe you work for him!<br/><br/><i>DAISY falls silent as the presenter reaches the lectern.</i><br/><br/>PRESENTER: For tonight's program, we have a wonderful anti-capitalist poem by Mr. William Morris, we will discuss the latest editorial in the Whitechapel Star, and Madam X and Miss Kathleen Ross will present the case for the freeing of the Trafalgar Six.<br/><br/>EXT. BERNER STREET \x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>This lane runs very near the International Workers' Educational Club. RIVKA is passing down it.</i><br/><br/><i>A woman is dragged into a narrow alley and thrown to the ground. A Jewish man and two other men observe this and quickly begin to walk away. RIVKA runs up to Commercial Street, where she sees JOHNNY leaning against a lamp-post.</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: Quick, come help \x90\u2014 a woman is being assaulted!<br/><br/>JOHNNY: We'll soon get him sorted!<br/><br/><i>They run down Berner Street. Johnny steps into the mouth of the alley, and the woman's assailant, seeing him, quickly runs off. The woman stands up and we see her clearly in the dim light of a street lamp. This is LONG LIZ STRIDE, a Swedish charwoman and sometimes prostitute in her 40s.</i><br/><br/>LONG LIZ <i>(With a Swedish accent.)</i>:  Oh \x90\u2014 thank you. It's rare that you get anyone to help you in streets such as these. My name is Liz Stride, they call me Long Liz on account I am so tall. You are that Rivka lady? <br/><br/>RIVKA: Yes, I am\u2026 how do you know me?<br/><br/>LONG LIZ: Everyone hears about you, you are so kind-hearted. <br/><br/>RIVKA: Well, it was really Johnny here.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: No, no, weren't anything.<br/><br/>LONG LIZ: What is this place? This Workers' Club? <br/><br/>RIVKA: I've never been in there myself. I think it's political people.<br/><br/>LONG LIZ: Ah, like those Socialists, ja? I don't know from them. I'm from Sweden, it seems impossible that we would have Socialists.<br/><br/><i>[I waited three weeks to use that joke.]</i><br/><br/>RIVKA: Are you all right?<br/><br/>LONG LIZ: Oh, ja. It was just a john of mine, you know how that goes. Some people are never satisfied.<br/><br/>RIVKA: If there's anything else I can do, just let me know.<br/><br/>LONG LIZ: I will. Everyone always says how good Rivka is.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: You're famous amongst the whores of Whitechapel! That's a distinction to be proud of.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Do you have anywhere to stay?<br/><br/>LONG LIZ: Ja, but I have to get my fourpence first.<br/><br/>INT. THE INTERNATIONAL WORKERS' EDUCATIONAL CLUB \x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/>PRESENTER:  And now, Madam X and Miss Ross will speak about the Trafalgar Six.<br/><i><br/>The AUDIENCE applauds politely as DAISY and KATHLEEN walk to the lectern.</i><br/><br/>KATHLEEN: You are supposed to be workers for justice and the plight of the common man. If you care about justice \x90\u2014 if you care about making the world a better place \x90\u2014 then you should care about the plight of these God-fearing innocent men. <br/><br/><i>There is silence that stretches uncomfortably as the crowd realizes that KATHLEEN has apparently finished her speech.</i><br/><br/>INT. LEMAN STREET POLICE STATION \x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>AUBREY, HIGHGRASS, and ABBERLINE are making their way out of the station, having finally decided to call it a night. TC MILLER bursts into the room.</i><br/><br/>MILLER: Sir! Sir! There's been a murder!<br/><br/>AUBREY: Of course there has.<br/><br/>MILLER: I mean \x90\u2014 one of those murders.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440681/#Comment_440681" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T16:58:06+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  4:58PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode 3: Dark Is Life...

THE COURTYARD OF THE IWEC\x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>DAISY and KATHLEEN are making their way outside only to discover a large crowd has gathered in the courtyard.</i><br/><br/><i>MILLER, AUBREY, HIGHGRASS and ABBERLINE reach the edge of the crowd.</i><br/><br/>TITLE OVER:<br/><br/>30 September 1888<br/><br/>MILLER: A carter was coming up the alley. He saw something lying there. He went to go pick it up and saw it was a girl. With her throat slit! It's got to be the work of the Whitechapel ghoul.<br/><br/><i>DAISY pushes through the crowd and rushes to the side of the corpse, kneeling down on the pavement. We see that it is LONG LIZ. Her throat has been cut, but her body has not been mutilated. AUBREY comes up next to her.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: Oh my God! She's still warm!<br/><br/>AUBREY: Mrs. De Lanc\xe9, please stand aside.<br/><br/>MILLER: Come on, ma'am! This is too terrible for a lady to see! <br/><br/>AUBREY: Mrs. De Lanc\xe9, I apologize terribly for this imposition \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>DAISY: Get on with it.<br/><br/>AUBREY: You are a woman, so I need you to do something I cannot. I need you to examine this woman's lower extremities and determine whether they have been \x90\u2014 interfered with \x90\u2014 beyond the normal course of human nature.<br/><br/><i>DAISY nods and begins to perform a very matter-of-fact examination of LONG LIZ.</i><br/><br/>JOHNNY finds KATHLEEN in the crowd.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Kathleen! Are you sure you want to be out in all of this? Some poor girl's been killed! It isn't safe around here!<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: It isn't safe anywhere for an Irishwoman in London.<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Aye, but the fiend could still be around here someplace!<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: And what are you doing here?<br/><br/>JOHNNY: Just walking around! I ran into Becky!<br/><br/>KATHLEEN: She's here? We better go find her, then. She's less safe than we are.<br/><br/><i>DAISY has finished her examination. MILLER has flushed bright red.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: Nothing out of the ordinary here.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Well. Doesn't look like our man, but I imagine we'll want to find out everything that we can.<br/><br/><i>MILLER brings over LOUIS DIEMSCHUTZ, a Jewish jewelry salesman, to Aubrey.</i><br/><br/>MILLER: This is the man who found her, sir.<br/><br/>DIEMSCHUTZ <i>(With a heavy Yiddish accent.)</i>: Are you with the police?<br/><br/>AUBREY: In a manner of speaking.<br/><br/>DIEMSCHUTZ: I had nothing to do with this! I was driving my cart up the alley there. Something was blocking the way, my horse would not go forward. I got down to find out what is, I light match. Could be bundle, maybe somebody drop something? I see is girl and she is bleeding. I go find constable. I did not see anything else. Maybe somebody was there, heard my cart coming?<br/><br/><i>Some CONSTABLES pass by with several LOCAL PROSTITUTES, including RIVKA.</i><br/><br/>MILLER: It's true, sir! No one closed off the yard \x90\u2014 he could have been here the whole time!<br/><br/>AUBREY: Well, it's good then that we had some people here who understand good old-fashioned police work!<br/><br/>MILLER: I'm just a trainee!<br/><br/>AUBREY: Yes \x90\u2014 one of us in this relationship is supposed to be a policeman, and I think I know who it is. Excuse me, Miller.<br/><br/><i>(To RIVKA.)</i><br/><br/>I'm terribly sorry to take time out of your evening. Do you know this woman?<br/><br/>RIVKA: I saw her earlier tonight, I didn't know her before then. She called herself Long Liz. I saw her being beaten up over in the alley there \x90\u2014 she said it was just a john who got rough, she didn't seem surprised by it. Another man came and frightened her john away.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Can you identify any of the parties? I know you don't like to provide names, and I don't like to ask for them.<br/><br/>RIVKA: I do not know the name of the client\u2026 but the man who hit her was about thirty, dark hair and a brown mustache. He was wearing a long coat, and a round hat.<br/><br/><i>[Added post session to conform to the description given by possible witness Israel Schwartz.]</i><br/><br/>AUBREY: Can you tell me any more about the man who chased him away?<br/><br/>RIVKA: He was just the first man I ran into\u2026 <br/><br/>AUBREY: I assure you, Miss Solomon, we're not going to harass anyone.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Six feet tall, black hair.<br/><br/>AUBREY: Miss Solomon, I won't detain you any further. These are trying times, and I am sure we both have a great deal to do. Unless you would find it troublesome or inconvenient, may I attend your home later this evening?<br/><br/>RIVKA: Yes, sir.<br/><br/><i>RIVKA, JOHNNY, and KATHLEEN leave together to return to Hanbury Street. A cart is driven up by some constables, and the body of LONG LIZ is loaded into it. DAISY watches them lay her body inside the cart, and AUBREY finds her there.</i><br/><br/>AUBREY: Mrs. De Lanc\xe9.<br/><br/>DAISY: Mr. Matchington.<br/><br/>AUBREY: It's amazing the places we keep running into each other.<br/><br/>DAISY: Yes.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I'm sorry, I'm going to ask this, and it's going to come out the wrong way. I don't mean to pry and I don't intend to convey disapproval, because frankly I don't care. These are very unusual circumstances in which I find you, and it's not the first time we've run into each other in a situation approximating this one. And curiosity compels me to ask, why this is so?<br/><br/>DAISY: Would you like to talk a bit on my way home, Mr. Matchington?<br/><br/>AUBREY: A bit perhaps. I do actually have to return to this neighborhood later as I have other errands to attend to.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440682/#Comment_440682" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T16:58:26+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  4:58PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode 3: Dark Is Life... (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET \x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>DAISY and AUBREY are walking down this broad main street.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: I am a not-very-secret Socialist \x90\u2014 secret for respectability's sake, which is why I go through this nonsense with the veil. I in fact was recruited by Miss Ross to assist her in freeing her father.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I see. Go on.<br/><br/>DAISY: Since it seems like there was indeed a miscarriage of justice there \x90\u2014 indeed, an appalling one at that \x90\u2014 I complied, especially as he is sick, maybe with typhus or even consumption. She made a speech tonight at the Socialist hall. I helped.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I see. I do not have much concourse with Miss Ross personally. I do wish that if she had concerns about her father that she would have come to me. I can't say that I know much about the justice of the case \x90\u2014 I can only say that if the police swept him up it was probably for no reason \x90\u2014 <br/>but if he has become ill because of mistreatment, I am appalled. I am perhaps more interested than anyone in that man's well-being. I will attend to this shortly.<br/><br/><i>(Pause.)</i><br/><br/>I think we were going to discuss our mutual acquaintances at some future date, and that moment seems to have arrived. As I believe I made clear earlier, I know Miss Solomon through my previous investigations, and the current crisis has only increased our contact. She has been most useful in the course of our earlier interactions, as she was again tonight. You understand, of course, that my interest in her is of an academic and professional nature, although I do find her to be rather above the grade of the type of woman of her vocation one commonly encounters. Indeed, in her own way she resembles Mr. Ross and holds a similar fascination for me. In much the same way. I find.<br/><br/><i>[This is my best attempt to put AP\u2019s "I try to get Daisy to understand that I have interactions with Rivka that don't involve me soliciting her or being creepily in love with her" into dialog.]</i><br/><br/>DAISY: Of course. <br/><br/>EXT. THE HANBURY STREET BOARDINGHOUSE \u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>RIVKA, JOHNNY, and KATHLEEN are approaching the entrance to the house. RIVKA has just told JOHNNY about the description she gave AUBREY.</i><br/><br/>JOHNNY: Six feet tall? That's very flattering. You did right, Becky. Never tell them damn coppers anything.<br/><br/>RIVKA: Well, I wouldn't tell them anything about you\u2026 I wouldn't want them to know anything about you that would get their attention.<br/><br/>EXT. THE DE LANCE TOWNHOUSE \x90\u2014 NIGHT<br/><br/><i>DAISY and AUBREY have reached the front door of DAISY'S house. They pause for a moment in the light of a streetlamp.</i><br/><br/>DAISY: I approve of your knowing Miss Solomon. She's my friend! I met her through Finn, you remember. He was doubtless doing things before I met him.<br/><br/>AUBREY: I see. That would account for it, yes. Thank you, Mrs. De Lanc\xe9. <br/>DAISY: Anyway, she's a wonderful woman, frankly better than a lot of those hens at the Xenophon club \x90\u2014 <br/><br/>She stops as she sees TC MILLER comes tearing down the street toward them.<br/><br/>MILLER: Thank God I found you, sir.
