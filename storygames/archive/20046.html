Let me cut to the chase.<br/>Last week I stumbled upon John Harper's brilliant game Ghost//Echo.  I liked it so much I decided to try my own hand at creating what he calls an oracular game.  Thus we have my own microsystem, Shadow &amp; Light  (Note the shameless similarity <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ).<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4fy1b7d83p4iyc9/Shadow%20%26%20Light_v3.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">Dropbox Link</a><br/><br/>Now, I extrapolated Mr. Harper's idea of defining setting and circumstance throughout play to say, "Well, why not define the characters themselves with equally cryptic designations and then give that definition a mechanical consequence."  Thus we have what I call Traits.  They are the four "I am" statements.  <br/><br/>A friend of mine, has expressed concern that leaving these statements so nebulous introduces too much "derp."  For example, someone defining the codename Echo to give them some crazy advantage that just barely fits narratively or hardly makes sense in regards to the name.  I'm not against this entirely -after all the philosophy seems to be, if you can justify it, it is.  However, I can't necessarily refute his claim that such wide open terms for Traits impose no restriction at all.  If the point is to provide a cryptic kind of restriction that the players explore to find meaning and thus bring life to their character, a term that essentially has no restriction because it's too vague is pointless.  This seems a fair point to me.  <br/><br/>My solution to this is to go back and re-term the codenames as clear archetypes of Face character, Sneak Character, Caster Character, Tech guy, Melee Character, and Ranged Character.  However, I'm hesitant to give such clear cut restrictions.  I don't know.  I'm wondering if what I have now is accessible enough, or just too vague to be useful.<br/><br/>Secondly, I stuck to the idea of cryptic when creating terms for player starting equipment.  Slipsuit has no intrinsic meaning, my hope was a player might read that and conjure up some image of a working combat/infiltration suit and say my slipsuit is so named because of X and Y functions.  Which I would allow them to use to drive the narrative of their actions.<br/>Example, "My slipsuit can create a temporary camo field a la metal gear solid IV to help me sneak by the guards hugging the walls of the corridor."<br/><br/>Have I pushed the concept of an oracular game too far?  Did I inadvertantly reach the point of so vague as to be meaningless and thus introduce massive chaos?  I was trying to inspire creativity without being too stifling.  Conversely, is "so vague as to be intrinsically meaningless" a viable method to let player imagination impose their own constraints?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ArtPatient" title="ArtPatient"><img alt="ArtPatient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ArtPatient">ArtPatient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443483/#Comment_443483" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T19:37:11+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  7:37PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Apologies for the length of reply. I'm working through something similar and am examining your game mainly from a nuts and bolts perspective. I'm trying to take somewhat less vague traits and get players to creatively build off them. The issue seems to be basically the same, though.</i><br/><br/>There is a hard to define middle point there between too vague and too specific, somewhere, and I suspect the sweet spot differs from person to person. I am a firm believer that the right restrictions can enhance creativity across the board, though.<br/><br/>I always see a lot of advice for freer-form games that goes "don't just say you're a fighter; instead say you're Captain of the Guard. Better yet, Hereditary Captain of the Queen's Royal Honor Guard" or something. It's hard for some to invent things wholecloth that dovetail with the rest of the setting. So I like the gear and codename vagueness.<br/><br/>The difference of vague/not-vague-enough seems to be a matter of shared setting context that provides direction. The clues I see about the general setup are an angel/devil image, a dripping (blood?) font and that characters are insurgents for the resistance. The oracular elements deal with spy, military, monsters and sci-fi stuff. These are all neither too vague nor too specific and are constructive. Then the characters appear to have to choose whether they will be light or dark from moment to moment, which should make for good drama. Melee Character would be too specific a role; not everything should be decided by melee, obviously.<br/><br/>Which leaves the context to act as the creative restriction but I'm not sure what that is. Are you aiming for a Shadowrun feel? high end 007 action with sci-fantasy trappings? Mission Impossible planning and deception against monsters? Bourne takes on Ghostbusters? Perhaps that's supposed to be worked out in the character creation somehow? Or maybe it's meant to be generic and work for whatever happens to include the oracular elements? (I prefer to keep the sci and fantasy separate, so maybe that colors my perception.)<br/><br/>What (besides the particular objective) are the characters are supposed to do? Why do they have to choose light or dark? Why must they be part of the insurgence?<br/>If I understood that then I would know how my creative choices should be constrained in creation and play.<br/><br/>I was going to suggest adding an Antagonist like you see <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20054/thousand-descended-petty-lordlings-a-ghost-echo-inspired-vehicle-for-an-exalted-y-maneuver-system" rel="nofollow">here</a> (<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20054/thousand-descended-petty-lordlings-a-ghost-echo-inspired-vehicle-for-an-exalted-y-maneuver-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20054/thousand-descended-petty-lordlings-a-ghost-echo-inspired-vehicle-for-an-exalted-y-maneuver-system</a>) but it would need to go beyond that. Luke has to go with ObiWan because Stormtroopers or Darth Vader? No, there's something more to discover.<br/><br/>Maybe everyone has a different reason for wanting to stop the 'Ancient House Blackbird from planning to enslave the Moustached Republics.' Maybe they have all be wronged by House Blackbird? Is House Blackbird a bastion for light or dark? (I don't know what the right thematic question is, but I doubt it revolves around the light/dark bit. It seems like the light/dark thing is emblematic of something else even though it's referenced often.)<br/><br/>Whatever it is, if it gets established in the setup somehow, the maybe it's not so hard to see if a player contribution based on a vaguely named element fits the game and avoids the derp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443623/#Comment_443623" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T20:40:27+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  8:40PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>Apologies for the length of reply.

This game was my very first attempt at a microsystem, and the very first thing I "published" for consumption, so to speak.\n<blockquote><br/>Which leaves the context to act as the creative restriction but I'm not sure what that is.

The 007 or shadowrun or fantasy spin was to be determined by those playing the game.  Not just the GM, but the crew as a whole, deciding what elements were a part of their world, depending on how they flavored their characters and their equipment.  I wonder if maybe a short bit of text to the effect of:<br/>"Begin play by deciding the tech and fantasy level of your world, then select objectives.. etc." would be helpful?\n<blockquote><br/>What (besides the particular objective) are the characters are supposed to do? Why do they have to choose light or dark? Why must they be part of the insurgence?<br/>If I understood that then I would know how my creative choices should be constrained in creation and play.<br/></blockquote>\nTwo things: 1) I left some of their motivation out to keep the page count to one.  Terrible form, I know. :P  2) My thinking w/ the light and dark and the big question of "Are you Shadow or Light" is that the rest of the world doesn't know what to make of them.  Because of their high facility and overall competency, these characters are veritable chameleons who can be anything required of them at any given moment.  The unofficial name I gave the PC crew was Nephalem Squad, being both angels and demons as they needed to. When "angelic" they are powerful, imposing figures who stand-out and force the world to take notice.  In the eyes of the public, they are like righteous titans whose sheer power demands that people wake up to the world around them.  When "demonic" they are shadowy predators who tinker behind the scenes with silent efficiency.<br/><br/>Now, beyond the objective, what are they to do?  Honestly, I don't know.  I had imagined this whole thing as a quick adventure game, so I'm not sure there is any goal beyond this one small skirmish in the name of the resistance. <br/>I like the idea of everyone deciding why they are fighting in the resistance, I'm going to see if there's someway I can work that into the character creation.  My general philosophy was, if they determine an aspect of their character it has to be useful and relevant to them somehow, so maybe I need to re-tool that area a bit as well.  Any suggestions on what I can do in furtherance of that?  It may very well come down to having to abandon the generic setting idea in favor of a more defined world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ArtPatient" title="ArtPatient"><img alt="ArtPatient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ArtPatient">ArtPatient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443713/#Comment_443713" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T13:39:25+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  1:39PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That background explains away most of my questions (and it would be hard to add that setup and still be a single page.)<br/><br/>If it's just a quick, one-off type game, then maybe nothing more is needed IMO. If it's ever meant to be campaign style, you might consider adding a faction list or do something like 13th Age's icons - something to tie the PCs to the larger world. Those, too, could be cryptic in name so it's not as clear as simply choosing light vs dark.<br/><br/>I'm digging around looking at faction systems, so I don't have any concrete suggestions there - I want something that gives some traits to each faction, including basic goals, methods and some resources that matter for this game.
