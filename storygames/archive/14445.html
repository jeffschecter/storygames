Sounded like it might tie in to the more "open-ended"<br/>games you've talked about. Is this an angle you're familiar with? Any resources you might suggest? Any recommendation for an gateway "open-ended" game for a group that likes board games such as Settlers of Catan but isn't so interested in a fantasy theme?</blockquote>\nMy first though was Fiasco, and I also sent him some info about Baron Munchausen and Marc's <a href="http://gamepoems.gizmet.com/" rel="nofollow">Game Poems</a>. Anyone have any other thoughts or suggestions, especially for improv-technique-based games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328454/#Comment_328454" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T09:26:07+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  9:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been playing a big office game of Diplomacy via <a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.playdiplomacy.com/</a> and it's working out really well.

That said, failure is the more enjoyable and likely outcome, and it's a dark black comedy, so it might not be office-appropriate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
