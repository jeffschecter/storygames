Player characters and intelligent monsters will always know their alignment languages. They will also recognize when another alignment language is being spoken, but will not understand it. Alignment languages are not written down, nor may they be learned unless the character changes alignment. When this happens, the character forgets the old alignment language and starts using the new one immediately.</i><br/><br/>This made perfect sense to me when I was 13.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257434/#Comment_257434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T12:44:18+00:00" title="February 21, 2010 12:44PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah that alignment language was really strange.

If that were setting material in a modern sense nobody would blink an eye, but D&amp;D sure does represent itself in all editions as only distantly rooted in a proto-setting that should by rights be adaptable to whatever you want it to be. That's just the sort of super-specific stuff that makes no sense whatsoever outside the particular campaign world. The newer versions of the game have this sort of specificness, too.<br/><br/>In comparison, at least the newer editions of Tunnels &amp; Trolls make a bit more effort at separating the setting from the rules. The text is usually pretty clear about how "this is the way things are in Trollworld". Nothing like GURPS or other specifically settingless systems, but at least a nod in that direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257442/#Comment_257442" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T13:15:34+00:00" title="February 21, 2010  1:15PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some interesting readings on alignment languages:<br/><br/>From <a href="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=23223&amp;p=847028&amp;hilit=alignment+languages#p847028" rel="nofollow">HERE</a><br/><i>"In the old days, everyone was assumed to speak Common--whatever that was.

It was considerd that you might ask a phrase in Good to an innkeeper, like a secret recognition thing like in They Would Be Kings, to check his trustworthiness. This what what we did; other campaigns never went in that direction. A lot of the stuff I published in the magazine was about thinking outside the box and looking for new answers as well as methods.

I mean, there are plenty of setting-based explanations available for this sort of thing, it only seems strange because the text doesn't try to justify it or even clearly flag it as a strongly setting-based conceit. If the text said that "in this game world people basically have telepathic concord with people whose souls are of matching type" it'd be much easier to understand what that rule about alignment languages is about. That's not more off-genre for tolkienistic or sword &amp; sorcery fantasy than bulettes or paying 10 000 gold pieces for training, it seems to me.<br/><br/>That'd be one pretty cool basic explanation for the phenomenon, actually: all people have a soul whose type is determined by their Alignment, Glorantha-style. Similar souls simply understand each other instinctually, with little but a meaningful glance and some universal gesturing. This seems incomprehensible to other souls because of the lacking metaphysical element, and in fact many people think that those of opposite Alignment do not even have souls. Very hippy.<br/><br/>The other explanation is that there really are a couple or three world-wide secret societies with secret languages in the world, languages consisting of passwords and other signals. A very D&amp;D-like frivolous explanation for the automatically appearing and disappearing language facility could be that a "wizard did it" - each secret society uses some magic ("Mordenkainen's Universal Grammar" or something) to automatically record the correct language in your head. The spell has a limitation of only one magically learned language at a time, so the new language overwrites the old one.<br/><br/>Does Neutral have its own language, and if so, in which edition? I seem to remember that it did in some edition but not in some other one. Not having a neutral language would definitely make more sense for the secret society interpretation: people would be born Neutral, but most everybody would be inducted into the Lawful society from a young age (babtism, say). Chaotic evilsters of course would run around undoing this the best they could, and perhaps there'd even be some Chaotic societies where everybody is Chaotic instead of Lawful. Maybe just druids and such would belong in the small "True Neutral" secret society.<br/><br/>To make this weird setting complete I wouldn't of course forget racial languages, which I'm sure would cut through the Alignment language issue in some obverse manner. And then there is Common, which makes all of the above completely irrelevant in a very funny way. I have to say that getting rid of Common seems like almost the only reasonable way of getting anything out of this language issue - who needs Common if your society is ostensibly Lawful, and therefore everybody needs to know Lawful to get by? But then, if everybody automatically knows Common, it's not a choice between that and Lawful - Common is just what you use when talking with the Chaotics before you kill them.<br/><br/>I guess that even Common makes sense if you do indeed interpret those "languages" as simple codes or cants, instead. Like, "Lawful" is just Common, except you scratch the fish on the sand while innocuously chatting about weather. That still brings up the secret society angle, except now we could assume that most everybody is actually neutral and outside these societies. If we assume that only committed clergy and mighty heroes belong in the Lawful secret society, then it all starts seeming more sensible - it's essentially like fantasy freemasons, and the game's rules-premise just becomes "player characters belong in the fantasy-freemasons". This does nothing to explain why you forget the cant magically when you get out of the society, but I think I could work around that in a serious game: you've probably learned it all in dangerous induction rites anyway, rites that laid all sorts of psychic blocks and curses in you. So leaving the Lawful society, aside from making your dick go limp, would likely make you forget all of their secrets, too.<br/><br/>I guess that the "secret societies with secret cants" angle, although really far-fetched as setting-neutral rules, is probably the most immediately interesting approach gaming-wise. That gives you plenty of hooks, anyway: when player characters go meet the King, they can flash the Sign to the royal guard, which immediately marks them as members of freemason elite and conveniently explains to us in the audience why the King decides to trust them with the fate of his kingdom. The same works the other way around, too: the player characters, as members of an elite secret order, may expect that a temple with a Lawful leader will surely aid them in any manner possible in their work for a more Lawful world.<br/><br/>Yes, that seems entirely feasible. As an added bonus, consider how this also retroactively explains level titles: they seem pretty foolish as some general in-setting naming conventions, but if they're actually ranks in the fantasy-freemasons, they're not out of place at all. My character being "Grand Magister" or "Superhero" or whatever would be pretty understandable if that referred to his position in the secret society. Name level is when you get to start your own lodge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257464/#Comment_257464" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T15:47:28+00:00" title="February 21, 2010  3:47PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2010 3:49PM by droog.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes BUT: if a person doesn't use an acquired language, certainly they may forget parts of what they've learned.

I mean, I've always gotten the impression from between the lines that early pre-80s rpg play did actually feature pretty much as elaborate, consistent and literary fiction as I do in my own games (this, we have to remember, comes from a guy who is only as consistent as a given game's purpose requires), but that's certainly not what you get from the game texts. Reading the Monster Manual (which itself is a very anti-consistent idea, when you stop to think about it) gives you an impression of complete arbitrariness, which is not aided by the numerous "funhouse" dungeons and arbitrary rules like this Alignment language thing. In many ways I'd be more interested in the fiction that was created in tandem with these game texts but left out of them.<br/><br/>It is true that you can get a really trippy game out of old D&amp;D texts if you read all the weird things in them as literal setting advice in the spirit of "that's just how things are", but it seems to me that what most people rather do with these texts is to ignore the weird bits. The trippy thing, even - I'm pretty sure that it wasn't the intent of all this textual material to paint the image of an absurd world where only elves can find secret doors (better have an elf at hand if you want to find one you built yourself, apparently) and languages are learned and forgotten overnight. It all probably made perfect sense in the campaigns from which these rules are culled, but for some reason these designers seem to have been working with a sort of shovel-like writing philosophy: if it's a rule and we've used it, we'll put it in the book, no matter of consistency or explaining what any of it means.<br/><br/>It's not quite an early text by most measure, but in many ways I find that the Mentzer series of D&amp;D books encapsulates and enshrines this whatever-it-is that I'm trying to capture here - for some reason the whole rules-set, written at a time when eminently consistent dramatism was already becoming the default mode of rpg writing outside D&amp;D, is full of absolutely zany stuff that doesn't make a whit of sense outside of a specific campaign. I mean, check out this bit from the Mentzer Companion rules set:<br/><br/><i>A Crucible of Blackflame is a four-sided pyramid (as a four-sided die) made of rare wood, with a solid base, a triangular hole in each side, and a very odd fire inside - the Blackflame. This is exactly the reverse of a normal flame, black in color and emanating darkness and coolness, with flickering reverse \u201cshadows\u201d of light. The flame will burn anything normally not burnable, and will not harm combustible items (hence used to light a torch without burning it, and<br/>inflicts cold damage in the same manner as a normal fire (but reversed). Blackflame will also restore ashes to their original form, but does not return an incinerated victim to life.</i><br/><br/>That just seems like a moderately wacky magic item if you don't know that it's actually some sort of holy capstone item for halfling clans. It's like a signature magic for them, apparently each clan creates one of these things if they possibly can. (Dwarves and elves have similar things, but they're much less unexpected - a magic tree for elves, a magical forge for dwarves.) I have no idea what sort of metaphysic is going on in the game world to make halflings and Blackflame go together like hand and glove. The weirdness continues in how this holy magic item is then used in constructing a further magic item of amazing power:<br/><br/><i>Using the Crucible and the Blackflame, the halfling Keeper of the Flame, Clanmaster, and several halfling sheriffs can work together to construct a web of shadows. Occasionally but very rarely, the odd shadows cast by a Blackflame have material existence for a short time; if caught and immediately placed in the Crucible, these wisps of material can be stored. When enough shadows have been caught (a procedure that takes over 200 years), the Keeper can draw power from the Crucible itself (using the ancient secrets) and weave the web of shadows, a 10\u2018 square net of gossamer strands. It cannot be seen by any means (even magical) except in shadows or moonlight, and is carefully kept and stored by the Keeper.<br/><br/>The web is used for only one thing- collecting moonlight. When the Keeper and Clanmaster hold the web for an entire night under the light of a full moon, chanting the ancient phrases known only to themselves, the moonlight is caught and distilled, forming a single drop of silvery liquid. This oil of moonlight is collected and stored in shadow, avoiding the light of day. A full ounce is required for any effect (gathered over 7-10 years), and may then be rubbed into a fabric<br/>(often to make a sail or kite). Any object thus treated gains the ability to fly at 360\u2018 per turn when in moonlight which propels it.</i><br/><br/>I find that description hilarious: the most amazing halfling magic involves an artifact that reverses entropy. Its singular most important use is in making another artifact in a very arduous process that takes 200 years. This second artifact is only used in one thing, which is the making of a third, presumably even more powerful artifact. Quite epic, except for the part where the amazing power of this final artifact, constructed through ten years of tenuous, monotonous work, is to bestow <i>flight</i>, something available as a mid-level wizard spell. I'm sure that there must be a fascinating halfling mythology out there somewhere that justifies this one.<br/><br/>The Mentzer edition is probably the best version of the game if you like the sort of trippy shit the Alignment languages represent. At first I read through this stuff in disbelief (in 2008, I think), but then I concluded that this Frank Menzer guy must have simply liked the zany underground aspect of D&amp;D even in the relatively late mid-80s - no boring Conan pastiche for him, his version of the game would gather all the weirdest bits of older D&amp;D texts, add a dash of new weirdness and make it all into a coherent whole that has more in common with underground fantasy than the established literary fantasy genres of the time. The game series even ends in a properly new age manner in that Immortals box, in which the player characters transcend the mortal plane altogether (to join the Beatles on the Yellow Submarine, I presume).<br/><br/>To get this train of thought back to my point, I suppose that at some point the crazy specificity of the rules with no effort at providing a setting necessarily turns into a sort of setting definition, just one that doesn't have any geography, history or other bits traditionally associated with world building. Like this Mentzer D&amp;D, for instance; it has pretty elaborate rules for what and how demihumans are and live, as well as similar explanations of what different character classes do at different levels. Those careful explanations of how wizards build their towers and how demihumans gather in the wild places of the world, living in clans of limited size, it all ultimately defines a very specific setting. You can't use the Mentzer ruleset for playing in any setting except the "D&amp;D world", unless you want to specifically redesign the character classes and races and much else in the game's rules. It's not generic in the least unless you practice consistently selective reading.<br/><br/>I've yet to read any of the Mentzer era D&amp;D adventure or setting materials, actually. I probably should, just to find out if those actually pay respect to the zany dwarven land-submarines, questing immortal-elects and other weirdness from these rulebooks. My limited D&amp;D literacy has given me the sense that concurrent AD&amp;D material is very much more consistent than this stuff (Dragonlance, say - a perfectly reasonable campaign setting by today's standards), so it'll be interesting to find out how the spirit of the rules books has carried to other D&amp;D products, or if they are more like AD&amp;D lite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257503/#Comment_257503" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T23:02:36+00:00" title="February 21, 2010 11:02PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>See, Jeff, that's the thing I like: it's mystical.

Suddenly, the character knows he fell from grace only because he can no longer understand any of his friends.<br/><br/>This is talk about over on Dragonsfoot in the thread that Tim Kask oversees. There is some mention of players writing down an alignment that is false and later reveling their true alignment. The only way to figure out who is one what side would be by their actions and comprehension of the alignment tongue. <br/><br/>It's not to hard to imagine a situation where all the players have written down false alignments on their sheets.<br/><br/>Alignment and alignment languages also serve as a guide for what equipment the character can use.<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257687/#Comment_257687" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T18:06:04+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  6:06PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's a typical sort of equipment that would be tied to Alignment?
