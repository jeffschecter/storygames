It's in the Forge glossary, and its members treated "FitM" as a local term of art ("Around here, we call that Fortune in the Middle," someone would say, for example) but it seems to have been imported from the pre-Forge Gaming Outpost discussions, since (a) it shows up early, like maybe around 2002, and (b) no one spends a lot of time arguing about what it is; everyone who's been there a while just seems to know it. <br/><br/>As a term, IIEE comes later, and gets argued about quite a bit, so "the middle" to which the term as originally coined is referring is meant to indicate to something else. <br/><br/>As you know, "fortune in the middle" refers to resolution mechanisms where the operation of chance is used to establish whether there are circumstances materially affecting the outcome of an action. You're an Olympic fencer, I'm not, but if I roll high and you roll low, I beat you--because you had a sprained ankle or a head cold or were distracted by girl troubles. The die roll determines the outcome of the fight, and tells us that we need to come up with fictional reasons for why it came out the way that it did. <br/><br/>This is distinct from "fortune at the end," where the resolution mechanism incorporates all material factors as before-the-roll inputs, and the roll itself reflects the resulting probability. You're an Olympic fencer, I'm not, so just based on our relative skill levels the chances are 99% that you'll win, but the system provides die roll modifiers based on physical and mental circumstances, which we take into account to bump my odds up so that you're only 75% likely to win. "Fortune at the end" means that we only roll the dice once we've accounted for everything going on in the fiction. In contrast, "fortune in the middle" means we know some stuff, we roll the dice, we use the result to figure out the rest.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone ever bothered to specify "fortune at the beginning" as a thing, although it clearly can be used to refer to (a) random character generation, and (b) oracular prompts. Anything where the dice or cards come first and completely shape the fiction.<br/><br/>"Fortune" is of course a pretty common synonym for "chance," and maps onto Jonathan Tweet's typology of resolution mechanisms from <i>Everway</i>, where (1) Drama referred to someone deciding the outcome based on narrative fitness, dramatic necessity, or story sensibility, (2) Karma referred to a straight-up comparison of quantified character stats, and (3) Fortune referred to probability-based comparisons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468576/#Comment_468576" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-22T09:24:27+00:00" title="December 22, 2017  9:24AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2017 9:25AM by Rickard.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" rel="nofollow">Bill_White</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't think anyone ever bothered to specify "fortune at the beginning" as a thing, although it clearly can be used to refer to (a) random character generation, and (b) oracular prompts.

Ingoing is things like "I got this. Now lets make the best out of it", like a poker hand, while outgoing is "I did everything I could, now it's up to luck" - pretty much like playing on horses, but also include things like craps or playing on a slot machine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468577/#Comment_468577" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-22T09:58:23+00:00" title="December 22, 2017  9:58AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill explains it, nothing much to add.<br/><br/>The "middle" in FitM is not in the middle of the IIEE breakdown; as Bill notes, the concept predates IIEE, and they're distinct frameworks anyway. I think it was originally understood as simply a relative position in the resolution process: is the resolution over and done with when the dice hit the table, or are there still decisions to be made?<br/><br/>Fortune at the beginning was discussed cursorily, I remember, but it was more of a curio due to the lack of concrete relevance. FitM and FatE were more important to the early Forge due to how they illustrate a certain blind spot prevalent in the way task resolution used to be traditionally understood. The concept became much less used as attention shifted to other, more wide-ranging issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468580/#Comment_468580" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-22T20:49:15+00:00" title="December 22, 2017  8:49PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's interesting!

And distinguishing Karma at the End (KatE) from Karma in the Middle (KitM) would be helpful in games like, say, Amber Diceless, where in some circumstances you'd want to be able to just say, "The guy with the higher Strength wins the arm-wrestling contest," and in others you'd want to go, "Well, yes, you do have time to compose a stratagem, so we'll use your Warfare score versus his Strength." Something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
