The players will, naturally, be the crew, but I need a list of jobs and skills for the crew to have.<br/><br/>I'm thinking two separate lists: firstly, the Role of the PC and the basic responsibilities of that Role, and then another list containing Skills, things that any PC could potentially have in their background that aren't tied to any Role. Overlap is OK.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>ROLE: Commander; you're responsible for keeping crew morale up, as well as having a basic knowledge of the combat subsystems of the station.<br/><br/>SKILL: Your time on a poorly-maintained mining colony has left you with a greater-than-average comfort in extra-vehicular/microgravity operations.<br/><br/>Thanks for any help!<br/><br/>-AD.<br/><br/>(Edit: I'm also looking for some guidance on my conflict-resolution system <a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=430&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">over on Praxis</a>.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308466/#Comment_308466" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-16T18:27:21+00:00" title="January 16, 2011  6:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks sounds like fun - who are you playing it with?

I once read a SciFi story (Asimov?)  about a robot/android on a space station that was basically a prostitute.  Put there by the company to keep people from going insane.  IIRC she became ancient during the course of the story and was finally obsoleted. Might overlap in function with the Chaplin character given by Suna.<br/><br/>Similar characters exist in the (very good) Sean Connery movie Outland, but they are of flesh and blood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308681/#Comment_308681" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T15:43:46+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  3:43PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Musician</b> - you're just here for the beauty of space, and of course experimenting with how the low grav affects your masterpiece <br/><b>Skills</b> - quantum sonics, music theory, interpersonal relationships, nimble fingers<br/><br/><b>Doctor</b> - not really too familiar with how the body works, you just push buttons on machines that analyze and heal people. this gets old.<br/><b>Skills</b> - button pushing, bureaucracy, drinking, carousing                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308694/#Comment_308694" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T18:23:27+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  6:23PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EMT: Oh sure, it sounds like you're just a medic, but when an inbound ship collides with the docking bay, it's you that has to go outside in a suit and figure out how and who to save as well as keep all the air on the inside of the station.
