Uses Keys a la Blackbird/TSOY, and a fun but simple die mechanic inspired by Otherkind dice which gives a lot of "bang for the buck". <br/><br/>The game includes lots of adventure seeds and ideas, but requires an experienced and motivated GM.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a fun two-player game, take a look! The rules fit on about two pages, plus a character sheet.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lneoncexkt1etwu/Thus%20began%20the%20Adventures%20of%20%C3%89owyn.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">"Thus began the Adventures of Eowyn..."</a> (PDF)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450790/#Comment_450790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T07:48:07+00:00" title="January 21, 2016  7:48AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Update 1: fixed a couple of readability issues, added two additional <i>Rumours</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450805/#Comment_450805" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T17:52:49+00:00" title="January 21, 2016  5:52PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A question:<br/><br/>The game doesn't have a "GM" portion.

I really love it!<br/> <br/>From \u201eRumours\u201c I really like the last idea of balrog (maybe Lungorthin, Lord of Balrogs? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>). Powerful element and really dreadful one. One part of balrogs, which is especially awesome - is that it is possible for someone powerful enough to defeat them... but they must sacrifice themselves to do so. No one ever survived the defeating of balrog, not even Maia. Gothmog vs. Ecthelion, Glorfindel vs. Balrog and Durin\xb4s bane vs. Gandalf \u2013 the victor was always killed in proces.<br/> <br/>I used this element in my gaming as I introduced the \u201eboldog\u201c (lesser Maia who wore orc body) as general of angmarian hosts. One of the characters recieved a prophecy that he will die if he tries to fight him. All players knew that and accepted it as a fact. And yet, it came down to showdown where this character fought boldog to save some prisoners. He knew full well, that he will die and still did it because it was a right thing to do (I felt it was really Tolkienesque moment). The character died as was predicted, but managed to take that foul creature of old dark days with him in a duel. Really awesome ending of our campaign \u2013 strong emotions and victory that was paid dearly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450884/#Comment_450884" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T17:34:35+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  5:34PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an excellent addition!

Here are some initial thoughts:<br/><br/>1. For both players:<br/><br/>Play will be smoother and more "coherent" if you apply the rules of the game with an eye on the imagined situation taking place. When you decide which dice to draw on, which questions to ask, or which dangers to face, consider what is happening and how it is happening. If it is not clear, ask each other questions to clarify the situation further: "What does that look like?" "How are you doing that?" "What is the door made of?" And so on.<br/><br/>The clarification will help you apply the rules to the game. When marking dangers, for example, mark only such dangers which flow logically from the events of play. If something seems like it doesn't fit, don't choose that option. Both players should maintain the discipline of following the logic of the imagined situation and applying the rules accordingly.<br/><br/>2. For the Narrator:<br/><br/>* Always be on the lookout for opportunities for Eowyn to earn circles from her Key Traits. Point them out to her and ask her what she wants to do. The Key Trait rewards are designed so that following them will complicate her life and enrich the tale.<br/><br/>At any time when you see such an opportunity, say it: "The young girl really wants you to take her back to her village, even though you explained that it's been overrun by Orcs. Since you promised to deliver her to her family, following through on your word would earn you three circles... do you want to do that, despite the danger?"<br/><br/>However, always remember to make it clear to the player that the final choice in every situation is theirs; you may apply such pressure to them but you can never violate Eowyn's free will.<br/><br/>* Carefully observe which events Eowyn's player marks as Victories, and look for opportunities to bring those into play. The player has marked something as a Victory in hopes that it will become relevant again.<br/><br/>These things will lead you reincorporate material from early adventures.<br/><br/>* To prepare some interesting situations or adventures for Eowyn, always begin by looking at her character sheet. Try to come up with things which will give her opportunities to earn circles from her Key Traits or apply her Victories. If you have a great idea which doesn't seem to do that, don't discard it just yet, but see if you can modify it to bring in one or both of those things.<br/><br/>Example: You think it would be really exciting to have a nearby village attacked (and perhaps destroyed) by barbaric marauders. However, this has nothing to do with Eowyn's Traits or Victories.<br/><br/>She has the Trait "Born Warrior", which an earn her circles is she takes on someone in combat. She also earned a Victory against a Southron lord in an earlier adventure, whom she sent fleeing into ignominous retreat.<br/><br/>Perfect! Take your original idea and add an element to target each aspect. First, you might decide to place the Southron lord in the attack: perhaps leading it, perhaps among the ranks of the marauders, or perhaps as a traitor who has made the village vulnerable to the attack in the first place.<br/><br/>Second, include some kind of truly fearsome warrior in the situation. It could be the Southron lord, if that makes sense, or someone else (Eowyn has defeated him already, after all). Make this frightening enemy overconfident and honour-bound, so Eowyn could challenge him to a duel and attempt to defeat him.<br/><br/>Now the situation is ready: you have created opportunities for Eowyn to earn and spend circles, and reincorporated earlier elements to lend coherence to the story. This isn't some random raid; this is an old enemy coming to harrow her once more.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450950/#Comment_450950" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-28T21:21:05+00:00" title="January 28, 2016  9:21PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ecthelion,<br/><br/>The first chapter of Eowyn's travels South involves her riding through a small town, once a a part of Gondor, long ago, but for now independently ruled by a local Lord (of uncertain lineage). Presumably Elessar will come hither someday and make them bend the knee...<br/><br/>She finds there a difficult situation:<br/><br/>In the centre of the town, a young woman is at the gallows, about to be hanged! <br/><br/>Eowyn decides she's not going to let that go. She rides into the crowd on horseback!<br/><br/>There followed a daring chase scene, where Eowyn spirited this unknown girl off into the woods (and cut off one of the guards' ears in the process!). She vowed to protect her from the Lord and his men (according to her Key Trait of "True to her Word"), but the hounds found them and took the girl back into custody.<br/><br/>Disguised as a serving-woman, Eowyn snuck into the keep and escaped with the girl before they could attempt to mete out justice once more. In the process, however, she had to call upon the ghost (which affected the young woman in some strange fashion, though we don't know how just yet), and then the girl killed a guard on their way out. (I'm thinking I'll hint that this was somehow the ghost's influence at play, although it's also a very fitting action for this young woman, who is, unbeknowst to Eowyn, a rebellious, hot-headed freedom fighter with her heart full of anger. But of course she idolizes Eowyn!)<br/><br/>The backstory, which Eowyn doesn't know just yet, is that this girl has been training to fight with sword and shield (like Eowyn, she found a need to fight during the War of the Ring, and now takes her own protection seriously), and teaching the other women to do so, as well. When a guardsman came to take her sword away from her - after all, that's not a woman's weapon, and not allowed to the villagers - she drew on him and, in the ensuing scuffle, killed him. That's why she was being hanged: for the murder.<br/><br/>I also have, in my back pocket, a possible complication to the plot, if more is necessary: the woman have found and nursed back to health a war elephant (Oliphaunt/Mumakil). The creature is twisted and mad; if things get worse in the town, the women (a "knitting circle") might unleash it on the Lord's men (or even the gates of the keep).<br/><br/>That's more-or-less what has been going on. The game has moving along nicely, with all the mechanics supporting our story as well as Eowyn's choices.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion" title="Ecthelion"><img alt="Ecthelion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/725/nSOWTUWM8G2D0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion">Ecthelion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450961/#Comment_450961" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-29T17:11:02+00:00" title="January 29, 2016  5:11PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Paul:</b> Really cool! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> I like it a lot! <br/><br/>The idea of some independent and petty Lord (in South Gondor/Near Harad I take it) is particulary cool.

It works pretty nicely, and the psychological incentive to pile on more dangers when you failed the first roll is not to be underestimated.<br/><br/>I could condone counting dangers from round one as having happened as a possible change. Now you have to add NEW dangers to the second roll, if you want those dice. But that makes the system REALLY harsh. <br/><br/>Two dice per danger... that's interesting! I'll think on it.<br/><br/>Both those changes sound promising, but, so far, unnecessary. The math is fairly static, but psychologically it doesn't seem to matter. <br/><br/>I also considered "6 or 1, but discount any matches" as a possible rule. Use that if you prefer! So if you roll two 6's, that's still just one success.<br/><br/>In summary, I completely DO expect players to Push On whenever they need to, so I don't mind if there's no particular downside. The first roll is kind of a "freebie" - nail it and you got a "critical hit" of sorts.<br/><br/>It's roughly like this:<br/><br/>Nail the first roll? That's like a 10+ in AW (though with the possibility of bad stuff happening, of course).<br/><br/>If you didn't, now we reroll to see if you have a 7-9 or a miss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451193/#Comment_451193" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-08T16:21:57+00:00" title="February  8, 2016  4:21PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2016 11:32PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gave this some further thought overnight.<br/><br/>1) Although your logic isn't entirely incorrect, the odds ARE different. The chances of rolling a "full success" are lower on the reroll than they were on the initial roll. Not only do you need two successes, but you have to choose 6's OR 1's (not both added together).<br/><br/>In effect, your odds of a complete success are much lower (roughly half, though it depends on the number of dice rolled).<br/><br/>2) If you want to make it harsher, DO trigger dangers on the first roll, which means those dice are removed from play (unless it somehow makes sense to trigger a particular danger twice) and the circumstances are rougher for Eowyn. <br/><br/>(I'd been considering the second point in design anyway, but backed off at the last minute, as I worried it would seem to unforgiving. In many regards, it works better than the current rules, of course - in particular since it attaches a cost to failure once in a while.)<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451206/#Comment_451206" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-08T23:32:49+00:00" title="February  8, 2016 11:32PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I misread my own rules for a second; I went back and edited the post above to be a little clearer.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451207/#Comment_451207" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-08T23:47:45+00:00" title="February  8, 2016 11:47PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, ok!<br/>Sixes OR ones, not both together.

First, you might decide to place the Southron lord in the attack: perhaps leading it, perhaps among the ranks of the marauders, or perhaps as a traitor who has made the village vulnerable to the attack in the first place.</i><br/><br/>If one follows this advice, two things happen.<br/>Firstly, victories and traits become "motifs"/"themes" for the adventure.<br/>Secondly, reincorporation of victories and breaking of key traits become the transformative acts and "gifts of the goddess" if one believes in formula of "the hero's journey."<br/>I don't know how correct this is, just grabbed it off google.<br/><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Heroesjourney.svg/2000px-Heroesjourney.svg.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Heroesjourney.svg/2000px-Heroesjourney.svg.png</a><br/><br/>But you even have supernatural aid in form of the companion - maybe even threshold guardian. I dont find "The Hero's journey" universally true or completely satisfying, but its quite cool how your game meshes with it.<br/><br/>That would be my qualified guess of how they will feel in play.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I really love the opposed pushing on by the way, at least in theory. And it packs some punch.  You know the mountain witch? It has orthogonal stakes, and if two characters square off, either side can demand Ai-Uchi. Mutual success, basically.<br/><br/>Maybe you want to add some form of that as an option. We did in one of my earlier games. It created some very intense moments of deliberation and contemplation.

I'm adding three circles."<br/><br/>That's when you (typically, the GM, in this case) just say:<br/><br/>"Cool.

I've done this myself, with success.<br/><br/>All you need is to be able to write your own Keys (or adapt some from online, as I outline above in this thread).<br/><br/>I use a "generic handout" which serves as a rules summary when I play this game.<br/><br/>Here is a Dropbox link to the summary (the Qualities and Expertise are intended for a low fantasy/medieval setting, but you could make your own list for other settings without much trouble):<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uaov0k1ykme2pwe/Eowyn%20Generic%20Handout.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://dropbox.com/s/uaov0k1ykme2pwe/Eowyn%20Generic%20Handout.pdf?dl=0</a> <br/><br/>At some point, I'll update the original rules document with these, two; they're a little cleaner than the original writeup, so you can consider them to supercede the original rules where they don't match.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
