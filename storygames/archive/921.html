                    In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=879&amp;page=1#Item_18" rel="nofollow">another thread</a>, Joshua Newman commented:<br/><br/><em>What's the point of playing through if you know the plot will happen anyway? I leave that as an exercise to the reader. Hint: it's a trick question. Hint: OK, here's the answer: I think it's a dumb way to structure games.</em><br/><br/>I disagree, but it's definitely an interesting topic for discussion. Where's the play value if you know what's going to happen?  I'd suggest that, just as a public secret allows players to drive the game toward its intent and eventual revelation, an explicit end state allows to players to explore the journey without worrying about the (pre-ordained) destination.  I'm quick to defend this sort of structure because both The Roach and Grey Ranks follow it, and for The Roach at least, it works great.  My Life With Master, The Mountain Witch - same deal.  <br/><br/>Maybe the key is that while the structure is rigidly defined, the actual outcomes are not.  You know there will be a Christmas Ball, but you give that event meaning in play.  Plot without metaplot?                </div>

Exactly.  Making elbow room in the D&amp;D dungeon scenarios, only taken to a story-games level.  <br/><br/>You know that there will be a city festival. You know that the emporer will die. You know that you will get in a duel with Evil Guy X. But you don't know what will happen AT those events.<br/><br/>It's a little like a cross between scripted events (like going through a Shakespeare play) and improv.<br/><br/>Thinking about this problem/solution is hitting home for me, because the adventures in that game I'm translating (<a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com" rel="nofollow">Tenra Bansho</a>) By Definition have to be somewhat structured: A GM has to basically decide what events he wants in Acts, if not right down to Scenes. The Outcome of those Acts is not defined (although it can be assumed), but they are pretty structured.  The wackiness comes from playing through the GM's predefined acts (straightjacket), but putting on a performance, in the "acting" sense, in any way they see fit that entertains the other players (freedom).  <br/><br/>At least one guy from the Tenra list is pretty vocal about how he doesn't like the idea of roleplaying like that.  Well, luckily there's more than one RPG in the world and all that, but still to make the game better I'm going to have to explain the balance between framed scenes and role freedom, and give some tools to help people play the game easily, so it's something I'm wrestling with.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>ps: Sorry if my sentences are hard to read, my mind feels really dull this AM, and my thoughts are kinda rambling out here.                        </div>

                            Great topic. I've messed with chronology in my games many a time, even in relatively mainstream games. The example I always give is Gotham City Adventure! and my RIddler scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I hate riddles, and 4 out of 5 players concurred with me that they would rather chew their own fingers off than have to deal with actual riddles in a game. Besides, the riddles are just a gimmick, the cool things about the Riddler are: 1) he's so damn smart, 2) he's so damn cocky, 3) he's so damn sad. <br/>
<br/>
So the scenario played like this. We sat down to play. They knew today's session would have something to do with the Riddler, but they didn't know what. I said "He's laughing at you. He's jumping over the side of the fire escape and sliding down the ladder, wearing his green suit with the black question marks on it and that little derby with the question mark right in the middle of his forehead, and he's laughing at you. The rooftop underneath you explodes, sending you plummeting into the building below, but you can still hear him laughing, high above. He's getting away. You've chased him for three months and he's getting away. What do you do?"<br/>
<br/>
Everyone leapt into action (grappling hooks, athletics, etc.) to try to get him, I let them escape the deathtrap and get on his trail and then I said "Two months ago." and started a scene just after the Riddler had skunked them with a riddle with two answers, a scene semi-connected to the Riddler but also connected to some ongoing plots and personal life stuff they had been going through.<br/>
<br/>
I was worried that knowing they were going to catch the Riddler would suck the tension out of the flashback scenes, but oh my god, hell no. What it did was it gave a license to every single player in the room to ham it up, grab the spotlight, get emotionally invested, just go absolutely ape in their pursuit of the guy. Afterwards they told me that it was heightened emotionally, not suppressed, as I feared.<br/>
<br/>
I had told them earlier that I would be adhering to comic book plot arc structures: the villain can do no wrong when they arrive no matter how overwhelmingly powerful the hero and no matter how silly the villain or pointless his plans, then the tide shifts and the heroes gain the upper hand and finally take the villain down after a confrontation. But being told that, even by someone you trust, is not the same as experiencing it, is not the same as knowing that the game is absolutely committed to taking you to a place.                        </div>

                            In our Nine Worlds game, we use the conflict resolution system to determine how a scene will play out, then act out in detail how that happens, and that works really well.  It's a lot of fun to know how the scene will end, but not know how it will get there except for a broad outline.  In particular, talking sort of conflicts work out better than not knowing how it will turn out, because you can roleplay your character slowing losing their resolve and becoming convinced the other side is right.<br/>
<br/>
Which is determinism on a different time frame than what other people were describing, but still a matter of embellishing things already half determined.                        </div>

                            Er, here's what I meant:<br/><br/>In a James Bond movie, this is what will happen:<br/><br/>1: We'll see James finish off a mission (or a colleague).<br/>2: He'll get the new mission briefing from M, and Q will give him goodies and admonish him to please return them this time.<br/>3: He'll go do some preliminary investigation, during which he'll meet a woman who's a) intimately involved in the plot and b) physically attractive.<br/>4: He'll use his connection to her to get close to the villain.<br/>5: He'll get captured.<br/>6: The villain will tell him his plan (because he's a megalomaniac) and then not kill James (because of some reasons that are no doubt very important but unrevealed).<br/>7: He will thwart the villain, blow the place up, and get the girl.<br/><br/>So, if I'm playing a James Bond game, I will be disoriented if those things don't happen. They tell me the things around which I need to do my stuff. Those are all given for the genre. But if I don't have control over the variables? That's a drag. Here are the system points of contact over which I would want control as one or more of the players:<br/><br/>I get to design my gadgets. They can do anything I want. They're maybe great for one thing, good for something else, bad at a third thing.<br/>I get to make the girl's story up and decide her powers. She probably works like a gadget.<br/>I get to make up a villainous plot.<br/>I get to determine how the plot gets thwarted.<br/>I get to determine how the clues get discovered.<br/>I get to kill the villain in an appropriately creative and gruesome manner (probably with the option for him to escape and return in a subsequent story).<br/><br/>Those are the parts where I have creative control, and they all matter because the plot is known Ã¢â‚¬â€ preferably, expressly described in the rules Ã¢â‚¬â€ and therefore more of a creative constraint than actual challenges to overcome.<br/><br/>The issue here is that, given the productive constraints of genre and other pre-arranged elements, you have creative control over the parts that matter. When playing Shock: we know what the final conflict in the story will be about (though we don't know which way it will go). Our purpose during play is to get to that question. In AG&amp;G, we <i>don't</i> know, but that's OK because we get to do all sorts of stuff that matters and a plot will emerge.<br/><br/>Either way is fine. The point is to engage in the parts of the game that matter: the issue in a James Bond game would be not "Do we defeat Blofeld?" but "In what new ways does James Bond turn out to be a sociopath? What creative uses for wacky gadgets can we come up with? What does the Villain say about world events?"                        </div>

<i>What's the point of playing through if you know the plot will happen anyway?</i><br/>
<br/>
I think it boils down to how much illusionism you can tolerate.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think that PnP RPGs are unique as an artform because of the lack of determinism and as soon as you take that away you may as well read the novel, watch the play or see the movie instead.<br/>
<br/>
But hundreds of RPG campaigns are based purely on illusionism, so it's a matter of taste.                        </div>

                            I think I was twenty or twenty five when I first read Lands of Mystery and the idea of discussing scenes before they happened pole-axed me in the face. I maybe able to trace to just that moment the exact time I decided to be a hack game writer. Aaron Allston is still the man who has most expanded my gaming mind.

                            To drastically oversimplify things, there's three things we play for: to find out what happens, to find out how it happens, and to find out why it happens.  A game can lock down one of these, make it public knowledge, and the players can then focus <em>more</em> on the other two.  So if we already know what's going to happen, we can focus lots more on how it comes about and why the people involved make the decisions that they do.  Most traditional dungeon-crawling games lock down the why -- the dungeon is filled with evil things and has a valuable or important thing at the end -- and let the what and the how play out.<br><br>What a game really shouldn't do is lock down all three, because then there's no reason to play because there's nothing to find out.  If I know that the assassination attempt on the President is going to be stopped, <em>and</em> that it's going to be stopped by the counterespionage team decrypting the coded messages and trapping the would-be assassin, <em>and</em> that the counterespionage team is operating more out of revenge against the assassins than patriotism and duty... well, what's the point in actually playing that out?  At most I could play it to insert some clever lines of dialogue in there, but even then that probably falls under the 'how it happens' category.<br><br>Two interesting questions pop out for me, though: (a) is it possible to lock down how something happens? and (b) can a game lock down two of the three and provide engaging play that only explores one of these things?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Okay, to simplify it <i>even further</i>:  There are things that are important about the game, and there are things that are not important.<br/>
<br/>
Taking away people's choices about unimportant things just helps them to focus on the important ones.  If you say "So the villain has fled to Westoria.  You hire a courier-ship and pursue swiftly.  Now we're in Westoria harbor," that can be <i>just fine</i>.  Better than fine.  Better than asking "What do you do next?" when it's a meaningless question about pointless trivia.<br/>
<br/>
If "Do we save the world?" is an important question in the game then answering it ahead of time will reduce people's fun and engagement.<br/>
<br/>
If "Do we save the world?" is not the important thing then saying "Yes, you're going to save the world," right up front helps people to focus on the important questions.<br/>

                            Er, some people would call this a Creative Agenda. That is what the group in actual play seeks to create in the game in question. OK, slightly different, in that what the game itself presents and the CA may be different things, but it's what the game presents to work on that, if anything, informs play with regard to CA. <br>

                            I don't think this really equates to Creative Agenda.  CA is first of all a very broad umbrella term for a lot of things, and this is a relatively small component we're talking about, here.  Secondly, CA is (to my mind at least) far more about <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> you do things rather than <em>what</em> you're doing.  In other words, a "Gamist" experience could manipulate the reasons behind decisions as much as it could manipulate how events occur -- what is significant or important in a given game is not determined by CA.  CA determines what's important in the experience of playing the game, which is a little different.                        </div>

                            GNS is about the how and why, but part of why CA exists as a concept is, because as you say it's bigger than GNS, and includes things like the what. In agreeing to play a police procedural game, you're agreeing that exploration of something like dungeons is just not part of what we want to see getting creativity applied to it. <br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, like I said above, this is about how the game delivers the CA. Like Tony says, it's about focus. Which is what we always say about CA, too. Deliver a clear vision of play. <br/>
<br/>
And, yeah Joshua, new perspective is good. I don't mean to be dismissive, but merely to try to link the theory back if it seems to merit it. <br/>

                            Ha ha, he said "GNS".<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here's some other techniques we learned from messing around with time in that game (which I did a lot after the success of the Riddler scenario.)<br/>
<br/>
If you use a prop in a "future" scene, when it comes up in a "past" scene, everyone gets really super-involved.  "This amulet's going to end up on Ra's al-Ghul's table, and here we are chasing the goon that's got it!"  This to some degree offsets the "dang" feeling people have when a goon gets away in normal A-to-B-to-C play.<br/>
<br/>
The commentary of NPCs who were not there for the events of the characters' play can go a long way to making players feel like they're awesome. We did a whole fight scene in the form of a future scene (with flashbacks) of GCPD officers reconstructing the fight between the heroes and the Jokers' goons and at one point they just stopped and stared at the wreckage of something and finally someone said, "Her sword went right into the engine block." And everyone was grinning at each other. The cops are baffled by us. And in a much more visceral, up front way than just me saying "The cops are baffled" or describing a newspaper story that says "The police are baffled."                        </div>

                            Oh, good point, Alex.  That's also the central tenet of the Harold in long form improv.  When it works an audience is delighted and amazed, particularly when connections are drawn across a great distance thematically or temporally.  <br/><br/>Recently I saw a Harold with two early scenes - one had a guy who, for no apparent reason, just lay on the floor and ordered people around.  The other was a guy on a bike being hit by a car.  Later - much later, the last scene of the show - they did a scene in which you saw the bike guy ordering people around, and realized it was the same person, seen out of time sequence - he was paralyzed in the accident.                        </div>

                            There's a very fine line between prescribing creative input, and adding creative constaint.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point---<i>Mountain Witch</i> Fates. Fates add constaint without actually inputting anything into the game. The Fates in-and-of-themselves are meaningless. They require interpretation on the part of the player to add meaning. Think about "Past Allegiance". What does it mean? Who's past allegiance? What's the character's relationship to this allegiance, good or negative? What's the history? What's the allegiance's connection to the Witch or the mission? What are they going to ask? There are many kinds of stories the player can tell.<br/>
<br/>
Now consider this potential Fate that someone suggested: "'Criminal Past'---You've engaged in some sort of intense criminal activity. Someone wronged you and you dealt with it outside of the permission of the law." This one (which I think is just a variation of "Past Allegiance") I believe crosses the line and prescribes creative input. This fates answers alot of questions, instead of raising them. It prescribes alot of history, the relationship with the past allegiance. It prescribes what kind of story the player will tell, or at least constrains it---this is obviously going to be a story about remorse or retribution or forgiveness. The player doesn't have many options.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see what I'm saying? I believe narrow games is a very important trend in gaming. But as we move forward this is an incredibly important issue we need to consider in our designs. Are we designing creative springboards, or are we prescribing what the player's story will be?<br/>
<br/>
This question has no easy answer, and will most likely have to be decided on a case by case basis. Looking at some of new crops of games, such in the Ronnies and IGC, some do a very nice job and some corss the line.                        </div>
