I am looking for feedback on the classifications, and game selection. If anyone has any suggestions or recommendations please share them.<br/><br/>Week 1: New Perspectives (transitioning away from traditional games):  FATE (probably a Star Wars themed game with pregens and fixed scenario)<br/>Week 2: Succeed... Differently (looking at conflict vs. task resolution, and success with consequences): Lady Blackbird<br/>Week 3: Let's be the Bad Guys (unusual roles, fixed outcomes, shared collaboration): My Life with Master<br/>Week 4: Who Needs a GM? (looking at GMless games): Fiasco<br/>Week 5: Dice, what Dice? (looking at alternatives to dice mechanics): Dread                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344328/#Comment_344328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T21:46:13+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  9:46PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Week 1: Zombie Cinema<br/>\n<br/>\nDunno why, but I can't say I've ever been jazzed about FATE.

Aspects are a pretty interesting mechanic. But hey, I haven't played any FATE yet either(Dresden is on our short list though).<br>\n<br>\nAs for your categories, if you want more of the success with consequences with Week 2, that phrase instantly brings Apocalypse World(maybe Dungeon World too, haven't seen it yet) to mind. The 7-9 results are much more reminiscent of the success with consequences than Lady Blackbird, from what I can tell from looking at AW and playing Lady Blackbird. Lady Blackbird is much more suited to a one-off though than Apocalypse World though, from what I can tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the not-dice week, I support Dread(especially since if it's October it'll line up to Halloween). If you want other options, though, there are some neat card-based games out there. I think Primetime Adventures is card-based, but maybe that's again not suitable for a one-off. Like most of everything else I'm saying here, I'm missing play experience. The Halloween thing makes me say stick to Dread though.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344332/#Comment_344332" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T22:40:20+00:00" title="September 28, 2011 10:40PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Week 5: Mortal Coil is another diceless game; it actually uses a bidding mechanism (between the player and GM) to achieve uncertainty.

The way that Ron talks about task and conflict resolution, Rustbelt has both. The way that Vincent talks about it, it only has conflict resolution.<br/><br/>The way it works is, for unopposed actions (termed "checks") that might conceivably fail <i>and</i> have a consequence for failure, you roll a d10, add it to an appropriate stat (one of Tough, Savvy, Grizzled, Slick, Cagey, Personable, Thorough, or Uncanny), and compare it to a target number. For opposed actions (termed "conflicts"), the people acting against each other compare their roll+stat.<br/><br/>Whichever it is, if your roll isn't good enough, you must choose: Push, or Give. If you Give, you take your failure and like it. If you Push, you pay a Price and get to succeed anyway. In cases of "conflicts" where both intents could feasibly come true, if you Push then they <i>both</i> happen (the first guy 'cause he won the roll, you because you Pushed). However, when the intents are mutually exclusive, the other guy gets a chance to Push Back, in which case you go to Deadlock and there's one or more roll-offs (with more Prices paid each time you refuse to Give) until someone decides to back down because things are getting too heavy.<br/><br/>Where it gets interesting is when you're performing a check and are in a conflict at the same time. There's a lot of permutations here, and things get very very ugly in a very Tarantino-esque way. But basically you only roll+stat once, and that's compared separately against the target number (in the "check") and the other roll+stat (in the "conflict"), and you can Give or Push separately and individually in both (with separate and individual Prices). Depending on the situation, Giving in the "conflict" may forfeit your "check," or vice versa, or it may not.<br/><br/>(As for the Price, it can take many forms, ranging from injury to loss of important stuff to compromising changes in the situation. The GM names two or three Prices and the player chooses which one.)<br/><br/>But, the thing is, those "conflicts" aren't <i>conflicts</i>, the way that Ron talks about Conflict Resolution. They're actually just tasks against another character -- it's all about character competence and performance in that moment, as to whether he can hit the dude or whatever. The actual Conflict resolves when one guy decides he's taken enough punishment and the other guy decides to stop kicking him, or they both decide to back off because things are getting too heavy and not going anywhere, etc. In other words, dice don't resolve conflicts; people do. But what happens is, all the stuff that's established via the Task Resolution -- what succeeded, what failed, and what Prices were paid -- is what informs the people in their course of resolving the Conflict as a whole. The Conflicts are basically resolved by negotiation, while the Tasks serve to establish one or another person as being in a better position to negotiate for what he wants. The process of the Task Resolution is so uncertain, messy, and thoroughly undignified that it casts a very interesting light on the very <i>prospect</i> of Conflict -- it's not uncommon in this game for someone to demand something, pull a gun, and get what he demanded, without dice coming into play: guns have consequences, and if you're not prepared to face those consequences, then don't go up against the gun. (On the other hand, if you <i>are</i> prepared to face those consequences, it's very easy to take the gun and turn the tables. 'Cause, y'know, if you're willing to take a bullet in order to take the gun, there's not much anyone can do to stop you.)<br/><br/>Um, I hope that makes sense. Please ask questions if you need to.<br/><br/>(By the way, it's very very easy to get Rustbelt out of postapocalypso. The book even tells you how and has three examples: a weird fantasy thing, a Guy Ritchie kinda thing, and a Firefly ripoff.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
