I'm confused about Theme Guides and Event Guides and exactly what they're supposed to do. I'm just generally confused about the rules.  If anyone can give me an overview or synopsis I would really appreciate it :-) Examples of play  would be great and probably help me a lot :-) Or if you can steer me in the right direction I would really, really appreciate it :-)  thanks :-)                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461046/#Comment_461046" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-09T18:41:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2017  6:41PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2017 6:42PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So everybody is a Guide for everybody else. You are Event guide for the person on your right  and Theme guide for the person on your left. <br/><br/>Your job is to highlight, support, and bring tension to the character in the spotlight by laying on details and presenting interesting stuff related to the event or the character's themes. Usually this will be a light touch, just little lay-ons during scenes, but sometimes you may be called on to do something more substantial as guide. <br/><br/>So the person to your right is playing The King and has a scene in the Queen's Garden, and it is their first visit, right? They are going to look to you to introduce a ghost tied to a theme (that's what the card says). And The King's themes are ancestors and laws, so that's easy. Put your head together with the player on the other side of the person playing The King - who is the guide to their themes - and decide on a gnarly, problematic ancestor (or a wronged lawgiver, or whatever). <br/><br/>Later the person on your left is playing The Princess and in the middle of the scene decides to cast a spell. You are fully authorized to jump in as theme guide and describe what magic looks and feels like (Hey, her themes are the Gift and rebellion, so run with that), maybe offer some interesting complication or opportunity, or otherwise paint the scene a little. If The Princess is doing a good job of it, feel free to leave it alone, but know that if things are feeling a little flat it is on you to liven things up.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461047/#Comment_461047" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-09T19:12:32+00:00" title="March  9, 2017  7:12PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So everybody is a Guide for everybody else.
