I mean, if you really grok how most old D&amp;D modules setup and ran, they're pretty horrific, even if you disregard things like Tomb of Horrors and Ravenloft and obvious horror-fantasy.<br/><br/>Maybe part of why I think 4E has gone the wrong way: no more sense of danger and fear of the darkness below; now it's all Superheroes with Swords.<br/><br/>But that... is another thread....<br/>----To which Andy replied----\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Maybe part of why I think 4E has gone the wrong way: no more sense of danger and fear of the darkness below; now it's all Superheroes with Swords.</blockquote>\nJust an aside, that was never a problem with 4e alone. I saw it all the way back in 2E. It's all about the DM setting up the monsters correctly. I know that I can do Ravenloft (even the original Ravenloft adventure with some mods) "right" with 4e, keeping the creepiness and horror in there. And I've seen enough "this AD&amp;D game is all about HORROR, because you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your companions as always, but this time I throw Horror Monsters at you!" I had a totally uninspiring encounter at an RPGA event some time ago with one of those horrific Ravenloft Living Walls, basically the worst traits of a gelatinous cube, a flesh golem and a Clive Barker book... which sucked, because all we did was stand toe-to-toe with it and traded blows until it fell. Other times, we ran in horror from a neutral Ottyugh monster because the DM really played up the horror and suspense. That was all on the DM, not the Edition.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/>---To which I reply----<br/>I hear ya--can't blame the system ('cause system doesn't matter). <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But seriously, I think that older D&amp;D--even at high-ish levels--instilled a sense of the PCs' fragility, in GM advice on running encounters and in the descriptions of monster strategy for encounters and so forth. Now, maybe there's stuff like that in the 4E manuals, but I don't see it in APs or in convention games that I (briefly) watch or (at length) join for demoing the system.<br/><br/>Consider why CoC is so horrific (or at least tense): you are all normal schlubs, maybe with a gun that is going to do little more than tickle (or enrage) the Horror That Shall Not Be Named. Same with Chill, as I recall. And I argue same with OD&amp;D and AD&amp;D, at the low- to mid-levels (before you got your 30 men at arms or your wizard's tower or what-not).<br/><br/>Counter that with Champions: sure, a "good GM" can make a horror Champions campaign (note that HorrorHero talks about 100 point PCs, not 250+Disads!), but the core competence and versatility, if well-built, of all the PCs means the players don't really feel threatened. At least not on the level where fear or trepidation is produced... maybe a bit on the mechanical "Oh my god, look at its Speed, it's going to HOUSE us!" level.<br/><br/>So how can that be reinforced, mechanically, in D&amp;D4E, when I have this stack of Feat cards and my thoughts are always drawn to Attacks of Opportunity and flanking and marking, not the foetid odor of the dank and dark dungeon? not the inherent boogety-boogety of the monsters? Where's my SAN check, in D&amp;D? They don't even have Morale checks anymore, do they? My silly lackeys won't even flee the horrid lich lord!<br/><br/>Yes, a GM can cram all that back in. No, I don't think it's really embraced anymore by the current direction of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198547/#Comment_198547" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T11:00:33+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 11:00AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should take a look at what Marshall Burns is currently cooking up over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8957" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.

I mean, the example of Horror Champions characters being made with fewer points is a common way that RPGs have dealt with it in the past -- weaker characters are easier to threaten. But... it doesn't always work. I've had lots of games with fairly vulnerable/incompetent PCs that weren't really scary. OTOH, one of the most horrific games I ever ran was Earthdawn. <br/><br/>In Earthdawn the characters are super-heroic fantasy heroes. All PCs have magical abilities, and some of them get right up to comic book hero levels of badass. Its also got all these weird fantasy races, like talking lizards and big-eared elves and shit like that, all of which should mean it isn't that horrific by a lot of the standard theories. But man, this game was. And the reasons it was can be broken down into a few core areas: <br/><br/>1) Shit was really at risk. Everything the PCs cared about could be taken from them. Their lives, the lives of the ones they loved, their control over their own minds and actions, everything was up for grabs. <br/><br/>2) Evil was subtle, insidious, powerful, and everywhere. Horrors, the big bads of the setting, work slowly by corruption -- so while you know when someone gets fully fucked and ready to come after you with a chain saw, you might not know it far enough ahead of time to get out of the building. There are evils and plots, ancient corrupted shit that looks like nifty magical items, everywhere. And because of that it wasn't just that evil was external -- it could be in you too. You could be possessed, tricked, and used as a tool to do evil by manipulations gross and subtle. <br/><br/>3) Every power the characters had, every amazing thing they could do, could thus be turned against them. You can call lightning powerful enough to blow a dragon out of the sky? Congrats, someone is going to try to use you to blow away the walls of the city you live in. (One is reminded of the Watchmen movie....) <br/><br/>Those things played hard... they made the game terrifying. <br/><br/>Really, there are ways in which I think the problem with horror in D&amp;D 4th has less to do with power level or lack of morale rolls (which, IME, have more to do with simulating the fear of characters than actually putting anything of the player's emotions on the line) -- I think it has to do with the "points of light" heroes who are good doing good and bringing good in worlds in which the good and the bad are often pretty clearly delineated. The idea is really based on power fantasy of doing good by killing shit -- and the game is set up to make that okay. <br/><br/>But, if you take that apart a little, I think D&amp;D does have some of the tools to make a horrific campaign work. There are already some powers, for example, that make targets attack others on their own team. Expanding those, turning them into a way to make the Paladin unload his +5 holy avenger hammer smash onto some kid in the street... well, then you've got things at stake again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198563/#Comment_198563" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T12:08:06+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 12:08PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend told me about a game where the characters were trying to stop a D&amp;D-style mummy, complete with mummy rot, in a campaign without Clerics. The character were *much* more cautious about how they dealt with it when they realized that mummy rot was basically a death sentence. The DM was apparently able to turn that caution into terror through judicious use of atmosphere - slowly creaking boards from upstairs as the mummy shambled around, a character wandering into a dead end room and seeing a shadowy figure stumble into the lighted entrance.<br/><br/>I played in a similar scenario where we were low-level PCs trapped in a town with a troll. Only one troll, but a good swipe from his claws would have killed us. Trolls are creepy - fetid breath, rubbery bodies that let them slip through a hole in the floor, and they can scramble up walls. Again, we unconciously turned into "survival horror" protagonists, right up to luring the thing into a trap at the cost of one of the PCs lives - we dropped a church bell on the damn thing and burned the building down around it.<br/><br/>Brand's description of Horrors points up something else - is the reason they're scary because they threaten to break control of your character?  Mind/body-horror stuff has always been the scariest stuff for me. Maybe one key to making D&amp;D horrifying is threatening the PCs with partial loss of control of their bodies (some creeping disease) or their will (possesion), *without* taking away too much of their control and making it simply "sadistic GM" un-fun. Probably a fine line to walk, but I think it's do-able if the GM and players are on board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198565/#Comment_198565" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T12:21:04+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 12:21PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Brand that power-level has something to do with it, but for me a big part of it is knowledge and predictability.<br/><br/>My partner played 4E with a bunch of friends this weekend; I'm not to taking part in the campaign just because I'm just kind of tired of 4E in general.   I wandered through the room where they were playing occasionally and caught bits of the conversation.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting moments (to me) was when they jumped into a room to face another group of monsters.  The GM described the scene, but in doing so actually just listed the names of the monsters (this one is a Goblin Hexer, this one is a so-and-so).  Another player, who's made a habit of memorizing the Monster Manual since the days of OD&amp;D, immediately rattled off a bunch of stats and powers and started figuring out strategy with the rest of the players.<br/><br/>It got me thinking about that sense of dread that came about the first time I (and I think a lot of players) tried Old Skool D&amp;D.  A lot of it seems like it was fear of the unknown.  What would we find around the next corner?<br/><br/>Later, I lost that.  Oh, it's blink dogs.  Oh, it's a carrion crawler.<br/><br/>Add the predictability of monsters (what they are and how they act) to the "absolutely every possible action is already mapped out in the rules" take that 4E and other games seem to have (rules for drowning, rules for jumping, rules for...), and it really limits that feeling of the unknown.  That anything's possible.  It's a Kobold, after all, there's only so much it can do.  And I'm only a Level 2 Warlord, there's only certain things I can do.<br/><br/>The Mega-dungeon thread got me really interested in Tunnels &amp; Troll's ridiculously open-ended system.  One small set of rules for melee (roll dice and compare), and then everything else is "saving rolls" based on stats.  It's really made me want to run something totally open-ended from moment to moment.  Describe the monsters viscerally and no more.  No names for anything.  No limits on what the players can try.  Just put yourself in the situation and go.<br/><br/>Am I totally fooling myself that doing might manage to recapture the horror/excitement element that Dave is describing here? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198567/#Comment_198567" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T12:32:33+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 12:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me of a snippet from one of the Dresden Files books.

The scene in question involved purple winged-monkey demons that flung flaming poo, and a box of puppies. The series does have its moments. The novel with the horror-show monsters coming to life got pretty creepy at parts. But what it does, the very thing that David is talking about, is makes it quite obvious that the creatures the hero is facing are way, way too powerful to go toe-to-toe with. He runs. He fights when cornered, and usually loses. He does desperate things, and occasionally gets lucky.

I re-skinned every non-human monster I ran, finding pictures of intimidating creatures from the internet (mostly from wizards' galleries for 3rd edition monster manuals), giving them new color and description even when it was something as boilerplate as a ghoul.  I'd often tack on a mechanical power that quickly revealed this "thing" was not like the "ghouls" they were familiar with.  <br/><br/>So players never really knew what they were dealing with.

In addition to accord (mostly) about relative strength.<br/><br/>To summarize the <i>systemic changes</i> that seem to fuel horror:<br/><br/>* Hamstringing - The PCs lose a typical defense, making an otherwise manageable threat into a real terror (mummies without clerics).<br/>* Overpowering - The PCs, even as a group, have little chance to handle the threat head-on (Dresden Files - running as default procedure).<br/>* Disenfranchisement  - Player authority over PC action jeopardized (SAN loss, mind control).<br/>* Intolerable Stakes - The threat jeopardizes much more than the typical threats to the PCs only (the evil that eats children).<br/>* Unpredictability - Perhaps a combination of the above, or a "meta-method." The threat follows no known (to the players) patterns or past encounters.<br/><br/>Couple that with these <i>presentational</i> approaches:<br/>* Ambiguity - Goes with unpredictability. The players are never given a complete, clear picture of what they are facing.<br/>* Atmosphere - GM's tone and inflection; detail emphasis (perhaps over-emphasis or under-emphasis); focusing on isolation<br/>* Isolation - There's no way out; trapped with the horror without a safety net or a cavalry on the horizon.<br/>* Loss of Control - Perhaps also a meta-method. Players are accustomed to having a certain level of information and freedom to act--take that away.<br/><br/>So that seems to tell us a lot about how to run a "Horrific Dungeon Crawl":<br/>* No fast exit, no easy way back out, maybe even trapped and can only go forward or die trying.<br/>* More at risk that hit points and loot; the Evil Terror doesn't WANT the PCs dead... it wants new servants and playthings.<br/>* Barely balanced enough to make it through on given resources. Or, worse, impossible to make it through--someone's going to be left behind.<br/>* No brightly lit rooms; no rectilinear-form dungeon maps--the place is dark, dank, foetid, and a confused jumble of criss-crossing passages and dead ends (think Shelob's Lair, here).<br/>* Perhaps the cleric's devoted acolyte is along; or the wizard's apprentice; or the PCs stumble upon prisoners which become brudens (and are possible sources of both foreshadowing of the PCs fate if they fail, OR a source for betrayal).<br/>* No labels, no common stat blocks, never-before seen monsters. Even lowly kobolds becomes a filthy, snuffling, dog-headed hunters that can be heard everywhere... but only glimpsed out of the corner of the eye, flitting from cover to cover. Never mind that thing which can barely be described, because its form is ever-shifting and seems to swallow the light (hehe: Gelatinous Cube, again).<br/><br/>Anyone else want to augment the list? Can there be system that makes horror more than a morale stat; and if so, how would we hack it into (say) Burning Wheel or D&amp;D4E?<br/><br/>This is kinda fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198581/#Comment_198581" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T13:33:00+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  1:33PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite>Darkness is something that's extremely prevalent underground but it's hard to remember it both as a player and a GM.

If I sit down and imagine what it would be like to really be there, marching through dark hallways possibly filled with traps or monsters or both or maybe even something worse...it would freak me out, definitely.<br/><br/>But here's an interesting thing:  I don't generally play most of my D&amp;D characters as seeming freaked out and disturbed by dungeon crawls.  They joke around, they make thoughtful plans, they are fascinated by the architecture, they make sarcastic jibes at the expense of others.  And there's a reason why, the same reason why coroners tell the best jokes: because if you're actually seriously going to do that job day in and day out, you're going to find a way to distance yourself enough from the freakiness of it all to still be able to function.<br/><br/>I mean, if it was me as an actual person down in Undermountain or the Temple of Elemental Evil or wherever, I'd definitely sob pitifully while shivering in a corner until I died of a heart attack.  I'd be next to useless, because I wouldn't want to be there and I wouldn't be able to insulate myself from the horror of it all.  But when a character I'm playing is <i>choosing</i> that kind of life, that means that most of the time he's going to be making quips or acting stoic or cheerfully composing verses about the grand adventure he's on: he won't be showing any signs that the hardships of it all have any effect on him.  If he was the kind of guy who was as freaked out by dungeon crawls as a normal person would be, he wouldn't be going into dungeons to kill monsters and take their stuff.<br/><br/>Not that my dungeoncrawling PCs never freak out, mind you...it's just that it'll only happen maybe once in three or four dungeons, and only when things have seriously gone off the rails, because then it'll <i>mean something</i>.  So generally, I wouldn't like it if the (awesome) techniques brought up in this thread were used all the time to their best possible effect.  I'm happier if the really horrific moments, the parts that make the guy who whistled past every graveyard he ever saw suddenly break down, are the exception rather than the rule.  Most of the time I want his coping mechanisms to work just fine.  He'll laugh or get angry or get coldly logical before he'll admit to any fear.<br/><br/><br/>(This is why I generally don't sweat it when I'm running a horror game and a player starts cracking jokes during the scariest and most stressful moments -- because that's what people actually DO in scary and stressful situations.  They deflect, distract, and defuse.  It's an appropriate response both in- and out-of-character, I think.  If it's an in-character joke, it works for the story just fine.  If it's an out-of-character joke, then that suits my purposes, too: I don't want to scare the <i>players</i>, after all, I just want to give them decent material to work with to show what their <i>characters</i> do when they're scared.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198620/#Comment_198620" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T17:20:22+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  5:20PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2009 5:25PM by Wolfe.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>[blockquote]...most of the time he's going to be making quips or acting stoic or cheerfully composing verses about the grand adventure he's on: he won't be showing any signs that the hardships of it all have any effect on him.[/blockquote]</p>\n<p>Quoted for truth.</p>\n<p>I'm reading this, and suddenly have to remind myself that we're talking about fiction, here.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198685/#Comment_198685" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T07:28:09+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  7:28AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm... dungeoneers as coroners. You know, two guys that hang out at my pub drive the corpsewagon for a local mortuary, and they're definitely pretty funny, jocular guys over a couple of beers. Then, on other days, they come in ordering shots... and it finally comes out, quietly, that they had to use a snow shovel on the last pickup.<br/><br/>Something there, definitely. Perhaps there has to be a SAN element to ANY dungeon crawler, which both insulates them (I don't consider finding enjoyment in a dungeon to be particularly "sane") and which provides the eventual mechanical signal for a breakdown. Too sane: you run out screaming or would never go in, for any supposed prize. Too insane; you become a gibbering idiot, or sociopath, or worse (is there worse?).<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>A brief, perhaps illuminating, anecdote of my own "dungeon crawls" as a youth:<br/>--We nutty D&amp;D-playing kids used to make up torches (broomsticks, wired-on cloth, and lighter fluid) to go explore the drainage sewers in our neighborhood, which were "open drains" in a couple of places, all eventually heading down to Greensboro's major open aeration drain: Buffalo "Creek". Now it was a bit creepy, hunched over in those 4' diameter tunnels, straddling the trickle of runoff water down their centers, the shifting torchlight bouncing off the walls, discovering almost ethereal "grottoes" where a junction occurred and some light peeked in from the manhole cover holes and curb drains above. We mapped out the whole system within a couple of square miles, and soon lost the sense of creepiness, with familiarity.<br/><br/>Then, one day, we'd pushed as far down-system as we'd ever gone, reaching a juncture where one pipe ran into Buffalo Creek--the EXIT! A new land beyond the mountains! And all that. Turning to the other tube...<br/><br/>A FUCKING SWARM of katydids or crickets of SOMETHING was literally a writhing CARPET suspended from the top of that tunnel... and when the stinking torch smoke hit them, they did what millions of years of evolution taught them: jump in every fucking direction until they could find clear air. For a couple thousand of them, that meant right past me (the "thief" leading the party) to the Buffalo Creek exit.<br/><br/>Ho. Lee. Shit. I'm not joking, that moment is still SEARED into my memory. Harmless little cave crickets, turned into the stuff of nightmares (at least a handful of them, over the ensuing weeks). I'm sure I screamed, probably like a girl.<br/><br/>That's horror. From confident, knowing, laughing--not even thinking of how creepy this place was when first we started exploring it weeks ago--to panicked scrambling, knees in sewer water, to get away. From harmless crickets.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>So, yeah, there's something to that idea of the norm--even the bizarre norm--being shattered by the alien, the overwhelming.

The only thing she says for weeks afterwards is "His shadow was too big.  His shadow was too big."  Nice one, jerks.  Also, the crimelord sets up a meeting with you the following Tuesday.  Horror!<br/><br/>Punch the King in Yellow.  That will surely get you over the certain knowledge of the time and precise circumstances of your death. No doubt it will help you forget what you learned when you opened that bottle with your name on it.  You'll definitely never be haunted again by the image of yourself being torn apart in sexual transports, an eager smile on your face, willing concubine to a Thing with too many mouths, on 12 Jun 2012 at 11:39:41.04 GMT (though you'll be nowhere near Greenwich), once you lay fists on the Living God.  Horror!<br/><br/>Cthulhu is not about breaking up cults with shotguns. <i>Cthulhu is not about breaking up cults with shotguns.</i> That is boring and stupid.  Most published modules are boring and stupid.<br/><br/>Cthulhu is not about killing sorcerers and taking their stuff. Cthulhu is not about fighting ghouls in a 10-by-10 sewer.

Dungeoncrawling is a shit job, but it's the only job these people are fit for.</blockquote>I gave this some thought, and I'm not sure I agree with the base premise (their class makes them fit only for it) though I can agree with where you end up (it's what these specific folks are fit for). So how do we meet at the same place? (Maybe this should move to your thread? But it's still "horror-relevant" as I intend to approach it below, so....)<br/><br/>First, I see most--no, all--of the classes as quite viable in society (presuming a Tolkien meets Western Dark Ages society):<br/>* Fighter - C'mon! That's pretty much the class of everyone not a serf or a sitting noble. And even some serfs, if levied.<br/>* Wizard/Sorceror - Strikes me that these cats would be the first "artillery" in the world, as well as very valued advisers... or assassins. Or nobles (Charm Person? Hello?!?)<br/>* Cleric/Monk - Third most common job in this society, religion being the silk glove over the mailed fist of nobility. Shares scholarly duties with magic-users. (Includes Paladin--Jesuits, basically; Crusaders)<br/>* Thief - Fourth most common job in this society, after serf, fighter, and clergy of various stripes.<br/>* Bard - Minstrel to jester, traveling circus performers to heralds. Basically the only form of entertainment, from mean road-side shows to courtly plays and pageants.<br/><br/>So that leaves us with Rangers, who could be wilderness guides or border patrol or or military scouts or even tax collectors... but otherwise, yep, Adventurers With A Capital A.<br/><br/>So what I think makes ANY such class--folks who really could find a more comfortable niche than the serf (well, except maybe the Bards, the arts being less than a premium in these days)--into an Adventurer With A Capital A is some form of psychosis or less-than-common mindset.<br/>* Greed - Common enough. "I can make a year's pay in a couple of days exploring this collapsed mine!"<br/>* Curiosity - Killed the cat, they say. "I wonder what's in this dank, confining, probably dangerous hole in the ground?"<br/>* Altruism - Yep, it's selected against, if it's not for someone of your gene line. "I will help these total strangers deal with the ravening monsters from yon ruins!" (Never mind that it's the job of the local lord and his knights or soldiers.)<br/>* Desperation - Folks have done worse than dungeon delve, in a time of crisis. "Either I make a big score grave robbing the local crypts or Big Luthor is going to have my knee caps for shot glasses."<br/>* ...Or Worse - Those motives above are just for the GOOD folks. "I can find new minions to subjugate--or new ingredients for my experiments and spells, if they don't conform--in this underworld's teaming metropolis!"<br/><br/>So I say again, you gotta be a little bit nuts to accumulate a very marketable skill set, disregard steady and reasonably safe work for pay, and enter extremely hazardous (never mind creepy) locales on a gamble that there will be Great Rewards (even though the players know--because of the reward system--they will come, there's NO reason a character would expect them to be automatic). And ya can only be but SO nuts, or else you'll snap like a dry twig in the face of the first horrific monster that makes its Surprise Roll (or however it works in 4E).<br/><br/>I really think there's a mechanic hidden in this notion of mine, similar to CoC SAN, but having two "end points":<br/>* What will make your PC even CONSIDER taking up the trade?<br/>* What will make your PC a fucking loon, unfit for the trade?<br/><br/>And then you can attach something like Shock checks... and the opposite, Sane check... to try to push PCs toward one pole or the other.<br/>* See a Gibbering Mouther for the first time? Roll a SAN check or take 1d10 Shock points. Do you bug out?<br/>* Spend a soothing night in the arms of a fair damsel, who seems to really dig you? Roll a SAN check or take 1d10 Calm points. Do you say "fuck it" and marry her and go apply for a post with the City Guard?<br/><br/>And how many SAN checks before PTSD starts to set in? Imagine a 10th level Wizard who has nightmares and awakens screaming Words of Doom!<br/><br/>Just drifting the thread a bit, with horror as a motivator to quit, not "just" something the "pros from Dover" can shrug off because they're so well suited, by virtue of their class (i.e. training) for the work.<br/><br/>Make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198955/#Comment_198955" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T15:17:35+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  3:17PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>First, I see most--no, all--of the classes as quite viable in society (presuming a Tolkien meets Western Dark Ages society):</blockquote>\nOh, right, definitely.
