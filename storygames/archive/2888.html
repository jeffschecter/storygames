Because I never did quite follow the whole push &amp; pull thing, but carrot &amp; stick makes perfect sense.

I wasn't on the original discussion here, but I think that it's interesting that these exact same terms were used by the Traveller folks way back in their GM advice rules. Here's what I find useful:<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrot: Mechanical reward for a certain sort of behavior.<br/>\nStick: Mechanical penalty for a certain sort of behavior, which hopefully brings about the opposite behavior.<br/>\nPush: Player provided impetus intended to get a player to have a character do something by creating a situation that seems to force the issue.<br/>\nPull: Player provided impetus intended to get a player to have a character do something by creating a situation that would seem to attract the character of the target player.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\nCarrot: Bonus dice in Sorcerer for cool description allows the player to select for cool descriptions, and get rewarded.<br/>\nStick: Penalties to having a character downhill in D&amp;D; give players incentive to have their characters seek high ground in fights.<br/>\nPush: The GM says that the COPs are coming to arrest the character, if they don't leave immediately, which intends to get the player to have the character leave the scene.<br/>\nPull: The GM has an NPC tell you that they'll pay you 2 Million Credits if you take the whatsis to Planet X, intending to get the player to have his character go on the adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrot's and Sticks hit the player. Pushes and Pulls hit the character, and maybe the player, if he feels like playing along.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see my bias showing in this analysis, of course. See also "Grabs" vs "Hooks." Grabs are situation that engages the player. "Hooks" are situations aimed at forcing the player to engage by making alternate behavior implausible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65525/#Comment_65525" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T13:06:46+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  1:06PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2007 1:09PM by Brand_Robins.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thought on it, without going deep into it and without driving myself to drink, is that carrots and sticks are probably one way of pulling and pushing. I think that in terms of what Mo was talking about way back in the way back, which included game reward bribery and such things, carrot and stick do fit in. They may not be the whole thing, but one specific example of it, but they do feel like they really are part of it. <br>\n<br>\nMuch of what others have said also rings true, and I like Mike's analysis and Tony's thoughts for specific applications and giving more specific terminology to the level on which things work. (Tony's thing about bangs, in specific, feels really right to me. And Mike's different levels of deviation, while not what I was thinking at first, may well be a good direction to go in development.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

It's only from the perspective of the guy going through the door that there is a meaningful difference.

I had to start looking for Push/Pull in the larger context of general social situations, and then I was like, "Oh! THAT!"<br/><br/>They seem to be slightly gendered concepts, seeing as they came out of a set of discussions about how the mode of discourse common in online gaming forums, although not overtly sexist, was somehow discouraging to women. I think men more intuitively understand Push, to the point they can assume it's the only way to do things; Pull kind of looks like a trivial subtlety to us. When you see it, your first reaction might be, "Why is that a big deal?"<br/><br/>I definitely don't think it's a case of merely being the two subjective sides of a single event. I think dragging in how a Pull might be mechanically tied into the reward system merely clouds the issue. I think the terminology is sound and Mo is smart for coming up with it.<br/><br/>Eric, I think carrot/stick is an adequate set of terms to describe the concepts, although lacking a bit of the nuance of push/pull. I think the only problem with those is, as Arref points out, that previous gaming texts have describe "carrot vs stick" approaches to GMing (yeah, like the Traveller texts), which in that case might both be Push techniques. But if they work for you, then cool.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66261/#Comment_66261" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T21:23:39+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  9:23PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2007 4:01AM by Call Me Curly.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Carrot" and "Stick" are clearly synonyms for "Reward" and "Punishment".<br/><br/>in a word: Consequences.<br/><br/>"Operant Conditioning" is the psychology term for how Behavior is influenced by consequences.<br/><br/>The terminology of Operant Conditioning becomes kinda confusing, in that "positive" refers to anything-- any reward OR punishment<br/>added in response to a behavior.  And negative refers to anything-- any punishment OR reward which removes something in response to a behavior.<br/><br/>So the seemingly-oxymoronic term "positive punishment"  would be exemplified by spanking (adding pain).<br/>And "negative reward" would be something like freeing a prisoner for confessing (removing confinement).<br/><br/><br/>I offer this as an example of how the terminology of Push &amp; Pull ought to be standardized-- in order for discussion to make any fxcking sense.<br/><br/>If behaviorists didn't all agree that "Positive" and "Negative" only refer to adding and removing things/ and some behaviorists insisted on<br/>using those terms as a value judgement on the nature of stimuli (all spanking is negative!)-- their words would be misread by everyone else.<br/><br/><br/>In the case of Push &amp; Pull, there's a another layer of confusing connotation-- that Push is pushy-bad-bully-male and Pull is polite-good-cooperative-girly.<br/>Or, from another bias direction-- that Push is straightforward and Pull is passive-aggressive.  <br/><br/><br/>While I'm at it-- I'll note another operant conditioning term: "Extinction"-- which means a lack of consequence to a behavior.  Like if you say hello to a wall,<br/>and it does nothing in response-- you'll eventually stop talking to it.      Actually, I think extinction ought to refer to the part where you give up trying-- that what it<br/>sounds like it should mean.  But according to wikipedia, it refers to the non-response.<br/><br/>Does the mere absence of Push constitute Pull?   Is lack-of-consequence a Pull technique?<br/><br/><br/>The only reason I know any of this psych jargon, is because of the wikipedia entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_training#Rewards" rel="nofollow">dog training</a>, which I found helpful with an actual puppy. That entry links to other design-relevant entries, such as "reinforcement" and "reward system".<br/><br/>There's also a Learning Theory section about the 4 markers or signals which one can give a dog:<br/>(Release marker, Keep going signal, 'No reward' marker, and Punishment marker)<br/>These terms are closely related to the others I've offered, so they too may be helpful for expressing discreet-but-similar concepts which have previously been conflated in past discussion of Push &amp; Pull.<br/><br/><br/>I would love it if someone would describe a hypothetical example of a person using Push with a dog,<br/>and an example of using Pull with a dog.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66393/#Comment_66393" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T12:59:10+00:00" title="May  1, 2007 12:59PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for everyone's input.
