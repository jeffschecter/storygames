And so that was how I ended up <a href="http://www.samhawken.com/?p=2518" rel="nofollow">watching <i>Breaker! Breaker!</i></a> and thinking about roleplaying games at the same time.  "No roleplaying game can emulate this," I said to myself. "I dare anyone to even try."<br/><br/>You may wonder just what the deal with <i>Breaker! Breaker!</i> is.  It's a pretty obscure film from 1977 that just happens to feature the first starring role of a certain gentleman by the name of Chuck Norris.  But it's not the presence of a disturbingly <i>not mustachio'd</i> Norris that makes the movie so hard, nay, <i>impossible</i> to reproduce in a roleplaying setting.  No, it's the subject of the film.  To whit: trucking.<br/><br/><i>Breaker! Breaker!</i> came out right smack in the middle of the CB/trucker-movie boom that included stuff like <i>Smokey and the Bandit</i> and <i>Convoy</i>.  It's a dirt-cheap, exploitation version of those kinds of movies \u2014 so it doesn't have the car-smashing and involved stunt work that the better entries in the genre had \u2014 but it's still a trucker movie with all that entails.<br/><br/>Truckers are the good guys.  Lawmen are the bad guys.  There's lots of\u2026 trucking.  And car crashes.  And chases.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just been my experience of them, but chases have never translated particularly well to the tabletop.  They feel like they <i>ought</i> to, what with the way combat can be dynamic, but usually it's just move to one range, roll, move to another range, roll.  Not exciting at all.  And crashes, with cars piling up willy-nilly and flipping over and all that?  Forget it.<br/><br/>I haven't even touched on the "trucking" part of the equation.  That's not just getting loads from A to B in the shortest amount of time \u2014 which could make for a decent resource-management game, I guess \u2014 but trying to grab a little of the '70s CB culture, with its handles and jargon and sort of quasi-outlaw veneer about it.<br/><br/>I suppose one could just say, "So what?" about the whole thing and chuck it.  At the same, though, I think it would actually be quite a lot of fun if it was possible to catch the essence of trucker films.  Trying to follow too closely in <i>Breaker! Breaker!</i>'s footsteps is folly, but the genre in general is full of good stuff.  Wanna be the Bandit?  Wanna be Snowman?  Hell, do you want to be JD Dawes?  Of course you do.  The question is just how.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/breaker_breaker.jpg"/></div> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263722/#Comment_263722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T13:29:56+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  1:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2010 1:31PM by Krippler.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A mini game I thunk up for chases for a Thief-game that might get written:<br/><br/>It's pass the pigs (maybe with dice). Target number = race length or how big a head start the quarry has. Roll two dice (perhaps better running skill = bigger die), decide if you want to roll again. When you stop you add the sum of all the rolls to your score and pass the dice to the next person in the chase. If you roll a 1 you ran too hard and tripped on something or got lost and had to backtrack or had to hide from city watchmen and lose your turn adding to points. Snake eyes = you lose the chase. If you pass the target number you have won unless someone haven't done their turn that round, in that case they get the chance win if they beat your score. <br/><br/>If you have some sort of geography you could ass obstacles, known or unknown to the racers (perhaps a stategic dimension if one racer knows of certain obstacles the other don't) like When your score passes 20 you're at the market and can end your turn tripping a fruit stand making chasers behind you need to pass Jump-checks or fail their turn. Also if you can by choice roll only one die that might be safer if you can pass the finish line on that round, simulating a person who is way ahead slowing to a job to make sure he doesn't fall on the finish line (and the person behind him gets the chanse to risk it and sprint like a maniac to win).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263730/#Comment_263730" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T14:11:19+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  2:11PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason Morningstar is the man for the job!<br/><br/>That said I have never seen a "trucker film" but from your description I don't think it would be so impossible to emulate...I think it's more that no-one has even tried it before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263754/#Comment_263754" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T15:41:31+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  3:41PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2010 3:42PM by Ron Hammack.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Dad was a long-haul trucker in the 60s and 70s and when he took it up again in the early 90s I got to go on a few of his shorter trips with him. I don't know much about the trucker <i>genre</i>, but trucker <i>culture</i> (at least as I experienced it almost 20 years ago) has plenty of dramatic elements to explore. You've got friendships, rivalries, sex, drugs, money troubles, long stretches of soul-crushing boredom, you've got men and women hundreds or thousands of miles from home working to support spouses and kids they haven't seen for months. It's a lot like what you'd see in a war movie, if you took out all of the actual combat. In trucking, the enemy is an Axis of Evil comprised of Time, Weather, and Sleep.<br/><br/>Some random interesting things I noticed about trucking:<br/><br/>* Trucks are big. Really, really big. When you're that high above the road, your perception of speed is very different from what it is in a car or even an SUV. You can be doing 60 and it looks to you like you're only doing about 30. While surrounded by tiny, fragile little cars driven by the dumbest people on earth. <br/><br/>* Long-haul truckers <i>live</i> in their trucks. Some of those trucks probably cost more than your house did. Trucking isn't like a road trip in a car, or even going somewhere in a camper or motor home. It's like being in a tiny but well furnished studio apartment that you have to pilot for 18 hours a day. I met a guy who had a full-fledged analog recording studio in the cab of his truck: reel to reel recorder, mixing board, effects units, the works. Some guys didn't so much sit in their trucks as they were <i>installed</i> in them, like the truck was some kind of cybernetic extension of their body. On the rare occasion when they had to decouple themselves from their rigs, they seemed vaguely lost and confused, like they'd popped down to the grocery store and accidentally left one of their arms at home.<br/><br/>* CB radios (which I imagine are all but dead in the cell phone/laptop/GPS era) are wonderfully convenient ways of exchanging information and socializing while you're on the road. They're also <i>completely not private</i>. But when that's your only contact with other human beings, you make do. Some people talk in incomprehensible slang, others share deeply personal information with whoever they're talking to and anyone else in range who had an extra $40 to drop at Radio Shack. It reminded me a lot of the early days of the internet, only with voice instead of text.<br/><br/>* A lot of times, you're not only responsible for getting stuff from point A to point B, but for <i>unloading it</i> once you get there. The company you work for might give you an extra $100 or so for unloading stuff, which you'll either keep if you do it yourself or give to a "lumper". Lumpers are these sort of grey market warehouse workers who hang out (or used to in the 90s anyway, I have no idea what the industry is like now) near warehouses with portable CB radios and negotiate with incoming truckers to unload their stuff for them. They're probably exactly what you'd expect manual laborers who get paid in cash and don't fill out a lot of paperwork to be: mostly immigrants (legal or otherwise), with a few ex-cons and the occasional genuine Scary Looking Dude Who's Probably A Serial Killer Or At Least In The Russian Mafia thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>* Truck stop food is never just OK. It's either ridiculously delicious (as long as you don't stop to wonder about the fat content) or like high-school cafeteria food only without the craftsmanship or attention to detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263757/#Comment_263757" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T15:57:32+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  3:57PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probably one of the biggest challenges is that it's not much of a party game.

You can make it like the classic Traveller cargo running adventures, but instead of a starship it's a giant truck, the space is the road, and the planets are towns. And instead of space pirates you can have road pirates. You can also have a varied group of PCs: there can be a fixer who finds the cargo deals, a repairman, some sort of biker bodyguard that escorts the truck, a guy to man the truck's machine-gun turret (yes you should have one), and so on... Of course it's not exactly how truck driving works in RL, but it can be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the chases, I don't have a lot of experience with them, but I cannot see any reason why they should not be totally awesome. Spirit of the Century has chase rules that are mostly like combat, with all the maneuver and aspect tagging thing, and it doesn't even use ranges. Spycraft has a system which uses the usual D20 combat style of having many kinds of attacks, defenses, stunts, and many things you can do, on a detailed wargaming-style board. That can work also if that's your thing.

(And did not in fact require a detailed wargaming-style board to work and be awesome, so if that's a deal-breaker, consider the deal...er...un-broken.)<br/><br/>Basically Spycraft had a set of loosely-defined maneuvers for the predator and the prey in a chase, with each side choosing one each turn and dueling with their respective driving skills to see who the winner is.  Depending on the maneuver, the results might just be getting closer or farther away, escaping entirely, forcing your opponent to crash...basically, a really fast-moving, FUN system that totally got the job done.

There's no reason to stick to the D&amp;D style adventure party model if it doesn't work.  Maybe we tell a story about four truckers whose paths keep crossing.  Maybe it's a competitive game where you play rival truckers.  Maybe it's a game for one GM and one PC (like Beast Hunters).<br/><br/><br/>Alternatively, the "only one main character" is an issue dealt with by most other genres already.  Most other genres already tend to deal with a single protagonist in film and TV, but with multiple PCs.  Steal pages from how they do it: maybe a trucker is a specific PC role, and other players rotate in and out of playing other characters.  Maybe the boss back in Tucson is a PC with limited GM capabilities, able to pull strings from afar with a phone call.  <br/><br/>Basically, this seems like a surmountable problem to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263910/#Comment_263910" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T11:09:59+00:00" title="March 24, 2010 11:09AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>Maybe it's a game for one GM and one PC</blockquote>\nThen who will play The Bear?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263920/#Comment_263920" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T12:29:58+00:00" title="March 24, 2010 12:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2010 12:33PM by Nathan_H.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Then who will play The Bear?</blockquote>I will!<br/>I would so love to do that show within a show.<br/>Wonder how they kept that hat on?

You can make it like the classic Traveller cargo running adventures, but instead of a starship it's a giant truck, the space is the road, and the planets are towns. And instead of space pirates you can have road pirates. You can also have a varied group of PCs: there can be a fixer who finds the cargo deals, a repairman, some sort of biker bodyguard that escorts the truck, a guy to man the truck's machine-gun turret (yes you should have one), and so on... Of course it's not exactly how truck driving works in RL, but it can be fun.<br/><br/>Regarding the chases, I don't have a lot of experience with them, but I cannot see any reason why they should not be totally awesome. Spirit of the Century has chase rules that are mostly like combat, with all the maneuver and aspect tagging thing, and it doesn't even use ranges. Spycraft has a system which uses the usual D20 combat style of having many kinds of attacks, defenses, stunts, and many things you can do, on a detailed wargaming-style board. That can work also if that's your thing. Did you try those?</blockquote>\nCar Wars.

Daniel wound up playing a Texas boxing expert, Adam had a hot rod enthusiast who was on the run after faked drug charges, and Susan played a guitar-playing indie truck owner. The random personality traits are great for a quick one-shot even if they're something I'd more likely ignore in a campaign game.<br/><br/>We had all these FUDGE dice handy cause of SBA, so we just used them instead of percentile dice and that worked really well. For those who aren't familiar with FT task resolution: the DM (Driving Master) picks a Speed Limit, the player decides how fast he wants to try and drive, and the player rolls dice equal to his Focus rating in the appropriate skill. We got rid of the chart and just read the FUDGE dice as 5 MPH intervals, positive or negative -- go over the Speed Limit and you have Smokey trouble, hit the Speed Limit exactly and you succeed perfectly, and then if you're under the Speed Limit your success level is determined by how close you get. This is flat out awesome because the player gets to determine how much he wants to push the envelope on each and every roll. More on this later.<br/><br/>I used the back of the book intro scenario, which is set just after the Canadian Commies invade. The PCs met in a Free Truck Stop in Pennsylvania and picked up the first job offer off the Job Board, which was trucking a load of goods into Texas. I'm gonna give away the magician's force here -- the book says that the job offer should be for whatever you randomly determined the PCs were trucking in char gen. I found that to be kind of a cute touch, and perhaps an early instinctive rebellion against Illusionism. <br/><br/>So they set off and hit the first Roadblock just over the border into Ohio -- a bunch of reconditioned Canadorussian tanks. The chase scene worked pretty well -- it really is just like the combat system with the hit points coming off the trucks rather than the PCs. Daniel wanted to swing off the truck and get into fisticuffs with the tank driver, which was OK with me but this is definitely where the system started to feel a little weird. Speed Limit sort of doesn't make sense if it's not driving, right? I think it was Adam who said later on that it might be a cute reference to, you know, speed. I don't remember this ever being sold at Gencon, so maybe they ran afoul of the TSR Code of Ethics cause of that? Dunno.<br/><br/>Anyhow, we played through it and they beat the tanks. I did a little foreshadowing with the Vietcycle, since I wanted to get one signature NPC in there, just for the sake of it. In a campaign game that would have been a better moment.<br/><br/>The next Roadblock was a bunch of cannibal clowns in Indiana. This is definitely where it got awesome. Susan went for it on her Driving roll to hammer through the Shriner cars, and blew the lid off, breaking the Speed Limit by like 40 MPH. It didn't seem right to roll on the Smokies table, since why would the Comcops be protecting the clowns? So we conferred a bit and decided that every Roadblock for the rest of the game would have additional clown complications -- the entire clown army swore vengeance against Susan's PC, and her compatriots. This really added a ton of flavor to the whole thing.<br/><br/>I won't do a blow by blow of the rest, but I gotta say, if you don't mind the low rent Red Dawn ripoff setting and you hack the system to use FUDGE dice instead of that ridiculous table? Not at all unfun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264070/#Comment_264070" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T13:31:08+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  1:31PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about Trollbabe?

It was definitely showing its age, though, and I don't just mean being faded and bent up. It was originally one of those boxed sets with a player's manual, a DM manual, some horrible gray dice and a marking crayon, and a set of punch-out cards for personality trait selection. Bryant just had the two booklets so we had to reverse-engineer what the cards were from descriptions in the player's manual. <br/><br/>The random character creation thing was cool. You draw a character personality card from the deck (we made up a makeshift table and rolled on it), and then you roll 2d10 five times and assign them to ability scores /in order/. This means you can end up, as in my case, with a drag racer without the right skills to back it up. Daniel and Susan might have had more fun than I did, because my guy was clearly not cut out to live in the dangerous apocalyptic world of Freedom Truckers. <br/><br/>It's not like I died, though I came close. I think we played the Meatwagon Mayday (damage and healing) rules wrong, though. I probably should have died when I smashed my car through the Ohio "tollgate." The combat rules are kinda complicated, piggy-backed onto the Speed Limit system in a weird way. Nonetheless, this game was pretty revolutionary for its time. (I was also sad that our Fate dice system "upgrade" meant I couldn't "crash the gate doing 98," a la the old song Convoy that I grew up on.)<br/><br/>The chase rules are cool. Once you get Smokey Trouble, you have cops (or some kind of bad authority) on your tail. If you choose to Hammer Down (run), you're in a chase scene. Now /you/ set the Speed Limit instead of the DM, so you can pick a number that you think you can hit optimally (knowing your own skills). This means the NPC police or whatever are likely to miss their rolls. If the Bears under the Speed Limit (and still under your roll), you put distance between you and them (and there's some set distance you need to achieve to totally lose them). If the Bears are over the Speed Limit, they spin out or crash or other bad stuff Bryant was rolling on some table. Of course, if you're over the Speed Limit (that you originally set), you lose control and bad stuff starts happening (another table) and your Speed Limit goes up or down and it gets harder and harder to maintain control. If you're under your Speed Limit and any Bears who didn't crash rolled higher than you, then they gain on you and close the distance. It made for some exciting scenes! Especially playing a hot rod guy. <br/><br/>I could spend hours fiddling with the Souped Up car and truck rules. It's not as involved as, say, Car Wars, but there was enough crunch there (mostly in the form of equipment lists and skill checks) that my PC could spend time and money and XP building the fastest thing on four wheels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264152/#Comment_264152" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T09:37:18+00:00" title="March 26, 2010  9:37AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, you're right - I can't seem to find a website for it either.  I seem to remember there being a fansite or something that someone showed me back in University, but I bet it was on Geocities.  It's not like the game caught on much at the time.<br/><br/>Bryant, you must have explained those Speed Limit rules to me ten times and I still don't get them - do you always have to roll all your dice?  And I could never figure out where my target speed came in - I thought that's where I got to decide how many 5MPH dice I was rolling.  In the end, I guess it was the the full-on 80s RP experience - I just resorted to saying "I want to run my truck into the tanks" and had Adam tell me which dice to roll.  It did seem like the whole risk/skill/coolness balance was neat, though - like, *anyone* can do a hairpin turn in a semi if they're willing to do it at 1MPH.  <br/><br/>I think the punching might have been a bit less weird if we'd played with all the original rules for distance, etc.  I mean, the "speed limit" jargon would still have been there (but it's not like modern games have grown out of having to have new names for every mechanic), but in a context of putting everything on a less abstract, more battle-map-y space.  My understanding from Bryant was that the actual game uses yards and such and has some rules for basing speed limit on turning radius for trucks, etc. but we just sort of took the main resolution mechanic and rolled with it.  Plus, I bet Bryant would have been even *less* happy if he'd had to figure out how wide the armored cab I was trying to climb into was, so we could determine line of sight or whatever.<br/><br/>I *loved* the random tables and cards though.  More games should have those!  Or maybe I'm just playing everything in the light of In A Wicked Age now - the fact that I rolled up a 17 year old ex-teacher (yeah, I don't know how that works - age is random, and I had a bit of Adam's problems with the stats, since I had an 8 INT but a 19 STR) who was carrying a load of watermelons around in his truck was probably intended more as a humorous result than to make us start thinking about the economic conflicts in the post-invasion world.  Anyway.  We're hijacking this thread to talk about Freedom Truckers now - had fun, but there are lots more streamlined contemporary systems for doing Smokey &amp; The Bear with.  Freedom Truckers is probably a bit too cyberpunk/post-apocalyptic to quite capture the feel Sam! was looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264218/#Comment_264218" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-27T06:26:11+00:00" title="March 27, 2010  6:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Levine</cite>Sam, you're right - I can't seem to find a website for it either.

Otherwise the game is going to get very old, very quickly.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293780/#Comment_293780" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T11:12:32+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 11:12AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 11:45AM by mease19.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>The main problem I see is one of lack of scope.

(e.g. bus drivers have a group of passengers that they can marginally control, bikers, drivers, truckers, RV family road trip = hardholder, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293785/#Comment_293785" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T11:30:07+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 11:30AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a sneaking suspicion that one of the Hell For Leather games would also make a good start for hacking a Truckers game, I just can't remember which one of them it is...<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293850/#Comment_293850" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T20:18:10+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  8:18PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 8:20PM by JuddG.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also noticed <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=84065&amp;src=FrontPage" rel="nofollow">"Trucker: Open Road Adventure in the Long Haul"</a> appearing today on RPGNow's new stuff.
