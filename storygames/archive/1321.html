                    So... after playing the Shab all-Hiri Roach tonight (which was fun and a really good time for all) and discussing Capes in broad terms over the last couple days on my blog with the players in my group, I've figured out a significant distinction between different types of games that I think avoids some misconceptions and frustration when introducing or even just discussing a new game with folks in my immediate play group.  I'm bringing it here because I think it might be of some value.<br/><br/>Of the games I've been playing in the last, say... two to three years (not counting d20), there are essentially two types:<br/><br/>1. Roleplaying games that have a 'story, now' focus in them (frex: Sorcerer, HeroQuest, The Shadow of Yesterday, Dogs in the Vineyard). By that I mean, you have 'your guy', you play them, and story arises from the conflict and Crises of Choice with which they're faced.<br/><br/>2. Storytelling games, perhaps somewhat descendants of, say, Once Upon a Time or the Baron Munchausen game, that focus on telling a Story, with roleplay as a secondary element, usually as a delivery method of said story. (Shock:, Bacchanal, Shab al-Hiri Roach, Capes).<br/><br/>It's not always clear-cut -- InSpectres is *probably* in category 2, but it's such a goofy romp thing -- I dunno, it's hard to say. Primetime Adventures I *think* is in category 1, but it explores the elements of Story so well, it's again hard to say. I think that certainly there's a WHOLE range of places a game can fall on a scale -- maybe with... say... Capes on one end and ... I dunno... super-crunchy my-guy Burning Wheel on the other.  <br/><br/>And also, with more comfort with a game like the Roach, perhaps the system goes away and the game moves to more RP focus -- that said, the Roach structure lends itself more to being aware of said structure... I mean, my perception of SaHR might change with familiarity, but... Capes? Capes isn't going to. It's *about* constructing a cool super-heroic story MUCH more than 'playing your guy', and I should add that it's GOOD at that, I think, but it's not the same thing as, say, Sorcerer.<br/><br/>At all.<br/><br/>Why does this matter?<br/><br/>Well... if I'm aware of that, and I analyze the game from that point of view when I'm first reading it and learning it, and then put that out there with people when I talk about it: "This is a story-telling game. We'll be doing some roleplaying, but the focus is sort of narrator-level, Baron Munchauseny story-telling with some RP" -- if that expectation is SET, you don't get as much potential frustration from someone who was looking for the cathartic release that comes from killing something and taking its stuff.<br/><br/>I mean, when you've got a guy in your group (or you ARE the guy in your group) who wants to play a super-hero guy, beat up some bad guys, maybe make a couple tough moral choices, but essentially play his guy and let the story flow from that... Capes will piss him off. I'm not picking on Capes. Capes is a good game, but it will not be what he was in the mood for -- what he wanted.  It COULD be, on another day, or when expectations are clearly set ahead of time, but not if they aren't.<br/><br/>It's good to know what you're gonna get, and it's clear to me (now, finally) that it's not enough to say it's a 'hippie indie/Forge rpg'. There are layers. Nuances. Out and out significant and important differences.  For me, the Roleplaying Game label isn't a sacred cow that needs killing in favor of a Story Game label (imagine a link to that other discussion here, cuz I'm lazy), because I think they're fairly different things.                </div>

                            Thank god someone noticed the post, I was getting self-conscious. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking it over quite a bit too.  I cross posted most of this on my blog and got some really cool feedback there as well, and folks reminded me of some other games I'd never really considered, which is really really cool, and even cooler in that I'm still basically where I was in my thinking -- it's just expanding it.<br/>
<br/>
Evolution of design aside, I'm seeing this spectrum of narr games ranging on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being on the 'Trad'-design Narr rpg games with heavy character identification and 10 being super-duper story-telling focus, where single-character roleplay is just a delivery vector. (Fucking Universalis -- how did I forget fucking Universalis in my example-of games, above?)<br/>
<pre>RPG   1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9       10   Story-game
  &lt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
</pre>
<br/>
So...<br/>
1. Burning Wheel<br/>
2. Vanilla Sorcerer, HQ, TSoY<br/>
3. DitV, Nine Worlds<br/>
4. Trollbabe, Dust Devils<br/>
5. Polaris, WGP<br/>
6. Mountain Witch, MLWM<br/>
7. PTA, InSpectres, Shab al-Hiri Roach<br/>
8. Universalis, Capes, The Pool<br/>
9. 1001 Nights<br/>
10... and I ran out of examples.  Probably lumping things in too tightly there.  Chalk that up to less familiarity with the games in the 7 to 10 range.  You could probably do the thing up in more than one dimension -- probably four -- but... yeah, I don't know enough about the development cycles on most games to do that, and this works pretty well for me.<br/>
<br/>
Once that's sketched out, I can waste HOURS puzzling over things like Mortal Coil! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (which I opined to someone today was the child of PTA and Burning Wheel, raised in the wild by a Trollbabe.  I guess that makes it about a four. MAN I wanna run that game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
Again, why mess with it?  I think it's a prepatory step to understanding/explaining what you and your group can likely expect out of play with Game X, and I think that's pretty valuable.                        </div>

It's also a pretty good start on explaining it to anyone, which may be even more valuable.                        </div>

                            Exactly.<br><br>My personal experience with my gaming group has been good -- over the last 3 or so years I've run InSpectres, Sorcerer, HeroQuest, TSoY, a little DitV, Princes Kingdom, Shab al-Hiri Roach, and I've bought and discussed a ton of other 'indie narr' games as well.  I've had My Life with Master for ages, ditto Burning Wheel, and I've hit another glut of purchases just recently.<br><br>To their credit, everyone jumps in with willingness and enthusiasm, but sometimes there's some confusion.  In the very first session of InSpectres, one of my players comments 'it's fun... it just doesn't quite seem like we're roleplaying as much... I can't really explain it."  <br><br>Well... I think I <b>can</b>, now.  <br><br>It wasn't that he was frustrated, it was just... not exactly what he was expecting.  We've had similar situations like that crop up since then. The Shab al-Hiri Roach was another of that type of experience; fun, but not as much RP as one might have gone in expecting.   In a non-game example: I and a couple of my players have been crawling around the outside of Capes for a week or so now, trying to suss it out, and finally concluded that it would make a really great superhero story, but... yeah... not really thick with the RP. This is why.<br><br>((One of my other players made a really great observation on the ride home after playing The Roach last night; she said that it felt kind of like playing a Lexicon game (which her husband and I have participated in quite a few of) -- shared storytelling with rules.  Different, definitely, but similar.  Yeah: I can see why it's sort of "on that end of the spectrum," now.))<br><br>So yes, to your point, Bob; that's largely what I see this being used for (at least on my part) -- rough categorization of these dirty hippie narr games in order to be able to tell my players (and me) what they can expect.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I think it makes sense; when you've learned to roleplay (or wargame or pretty much anything) in certain way, expect certain rewards from it and discovered the techniques that lead to a rewarding experience, unlearning it all is a huge step.

"Traditional" roleplayin games (GURPS, Storytelling System, D&amp;D, whatnot) are similar, as you said - while the details vary, they roughly advocate similar style of play. The Story Games, say, from 5 to 10 in doyce's (a rough guess; I'm not familiar with most of them) graph, advocate a different style of play - more collaborative, less emphasis on players playing a single character, and so on. You not only have to learn to play in a new way, you also have to learn to enjoy a different kind of "fun". Then again, the traditional rpg's can be played in various playing styles - some people have learned to play them more like the Story Games and for them, the leap is not that big.<br/><br/>Personally, trying out Story Games would be a hard thing for me, since they don't really produce the kind of stuff I'm used to enjoy. The ones (mainly Polaris) I've tried out produces kind of intellectual reward ("Cool, this works,it's nicely done") but no emotional reward ("... But I can't really get anything out of this, since I don't usually regard a collaboratively produced story as very intresting thing.").<br/><br/>The cool thing about roleplaying is that it's a huge umbrella covering a load of different playing styles, from where you can pick your poison, if you know how to choose.<br/><br/><i>Edit: Fixed quotes.</i> </div>

                            I'm totally with Jason on this: Adam for the win.  I think... I *think*what you'd see with, say, the 'first and second generation' narr games, is solid inverse curve that kind of hugs the x-y axis lines -- then, when you start adding some of the more recent games that take a little bit of this and a little bit of that from either extreme end of the axis (Mortal Coil: let's focus on characters and their passions, take alittle BW scripting mojo, and then mix in some PTA theme pitching and narration control...), you'll see plotted points that jump out into the open space away from both axis.<br/>
<br/>
My way... (with the straight line...) eh. you get a lot of thing gravitating into the 'five' area. :P                        </div>

Man, two days in a row somebody laid some wisdom out.  I'm an absolutist on this point: maybe there's a relationship between any two concepts in gaming theory, but unless it's cause-and-effect, I tend to see orthogonal (or at least skew) axes, rather than two ends of a continuum.                        </div>

                            Okay, I can't leave this alone yet, so... check it.<br><br/>Let's say we want to chart coherently Narrativist games on an x-y axis, as has been suggested by Adam Dray.<br/><br/>So... I'm going to arbitrarily make the x-axis the "Protagonist focus" axis, and the y-axis the "Story-gamey" axis.<br/><br/>And the scale is just seven criteria for each axis. (The critieria, I got 100 percent from talking to Ron about this whole thing -- turns out he's been pondering this kind of thing for about a year and then some (and thanks to Paul Czege for starting up the conversation between Ron and myself.)) So, you have seven criteria you check off for each axis, and that equates directly to the 'score' for that axis, ranging from 0 to 7.<br/><br/>X-Axis: Protagonist-based<br/>[ ] Strong person-to-character ownership<br/>[ ] In-game currency tends to be character-specific<br/>[ ] Story structure is largely focused through character POV.<br/>[ ] Play structure tends toward scene/conflict<br/>[ ] Task-resolution system, or conflict resolution 'breaks down' into higher-detail task-like mode<br/>[ ] Adversity mostly provided by one person (GM)<br/>[ ] Limited/social contract narration distribution<br/><br/>Y-Axis: Story-based<br/>[ ] Character ownership varies<br/>[ ] In-game currency tends to be whole-group or player-specific<br/>[ ] Story structure is largely focused at narrator-level POV.<br/>[ ] Play structure tends towards "turns"<br/>[ ] Conflict-resolution-based system<br/>[ ] Adversity-creation is distributed across participants.<br/>[ ] Narration distributed automatically and specifically via system<br/><br/>Now, they LOOK like binary switches, but the fact is, either 'side' of the same 'thing' can be checked.<br/><br/>As an example... <br/><br/>....I'll do TSoY, since most folks know it.
<blockquote><br/>TSoY<br/><br/>X-Axis: Protagonist-based<br/>[X] Strong person-to-character ownership<br/>[X] In-game currency tends to be character-specific (bonus dice, etc)<br/>[X] Story structure is largely focused through character POV.<br/>[X] Play structure tends toward scene/conflict<br/>[X] Use of task-resolution, or conflict resolution can 'break down' into higher-detail mode<br/>[X] Adversity mostly provided by one person (GM)<br/>[X] Limited/social contract narration distribution (social-contract with calling for scenes)<br/><br/>Y-Axis: Story-based<br/>[ ] Character ownership varies<br/>[X] In-game currency tends to be whole-group or player-specific (Gift Dice)<br/>[ ] Story structure is largely focused at narrator-level POV.<br/>[ ] Play structure tends towards "turns"<br/>[X] Conflict-resolution-based system.<br/>[ ] Adversity-creation is distributed across participants.<br/>[X] Narration distributed automatically and specifically via system (refreshment scenes)<br/></blockquote>
Hmm. Okay, that's maybe a bad example.  Looking at Mortal Coil:
<blockquote><br/>Mortal Coil<br/><br/>X-Axis: Protagonist-based<br/>[X] Strong person-to-character ownership<br/>[X] In-game currency tends to be character-specific (for some tokens)<br/>[X] Story structure is focused through character POV.<br/>[X] Play structure tends toward scene/conflict<br/>[X] Use of task-resolution, or conflict resolution can 'break down' into higher-detail mode<br/>[X] Adversity mostly provided by one person (GM)<br/>[X] Limited narration distribution<br/><br/>Y-Axis: Story-based<br/>[ ] Character ownership varies<br/>[X] In-game currency tends to be whole-group or player-specific (for some tokens)<br/>[X] Story structure is focused at narrator-level POV. (For theme document additions.)<br/>[ ] Play structure tends towards "turns"<br/>[X] Conflict-resolution-based system. (For theme document addtions.)<br/>[X] Adversity-creation is distributed across participants. (For theme document additions.)<br/>[X] Narration distributed automatically and specifically via system (For theme document additions, using Power Tokens to narrate.)<br/></blockquote>
And you'll see apparently contradictory things checked in there, because in some parts of the game, certain things are true, and in others, different things are.<br/><br/>And it's perhaps a bit indistinct, in its definitions.  That is in no case Ron's fault, but (if present) solely the fault of my interpretation of the criteria he offered up.<br/><br/>Anyway, just me thinking on the screen.  Input welcome, stonings artfully dodged.                        </br></div>
