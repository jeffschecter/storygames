I'm a more recent convert to the whole Story Game and narrative game thing, but I took to it like a fish to water. I love how these games all let you really contribute your own creativeness to the game, rather than having to know fiddly aspects of some fiction that someone else wrote.<br/>I had a bugger of a time with one player when I ran Warhammer Fantasy 2E game, where I had pretty much ignored a majority of the Warhammer fiction, and was running it instead more as a general urban fantasy. But this player kept saying "But the Sigmarites would then..." or "They can't do that there..." etc.<br/>Or like Amber. Not a bad system (though I'm not really a fan of diceless systems), but everything was so rooted in this complex series of books and fiction, that as a player, I had NO CLUE what the hell was expected of me. I even made my character saying he would be unfamiliar with the ways of Amber, and instead of helping me work him in to the fiction, the two other players who WERE familiar with the fiction took EVERY POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE of the fact that I didn't know much about it. Which, really, was a DICK thing to do. They basically treated it like a game of poker, and I was the dork getting ripped off.<br/><br/>But yeah...sorry...just a bit bitter about all that.<br/>Still, sometimes there is just no middle ground. Sometimes you just need to find a side-group who share the same vision, or at least are flexible about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312181/#Comment_312181" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-11T07:40:57+00:00" title="February 11, 2011  7:40AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed.

I propose that the answer is somewhat close to the fact that classical role-playing games of old (Dungeons, Vampire, etc.) were loaded with setting info and heavy with rules. That often makes for a game that is hard to lift into functional fiction.<br/><br/>I do surmise that you still long for something beyond that, in the classical games (correct me if I'm wrong). You may have had some rare moments of pure magic in them, where you and the character managed to elegantly suft a wave of choices and consequences, choices and consequences, c &amp; c, c &amp; c ... until the game settled, beautifully, beyond the narrative horizon.<br/><br/>To get there again, you may want to try out classical games of more recent design, with lighter mechanics, more conscious dialogue-techniques and setting-info given in a much more effective and inspiring way. I hope someone will be able to point toward such a game in English ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312190/#Comment_312190" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-11T08:10:59+00:00" title="February 11, 2011  8:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: DionysusProblem  for me is that everyone else we play with is like him and loves all those details.
