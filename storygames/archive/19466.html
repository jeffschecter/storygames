A series of accessible essays reveals what the imaginary worlds of D&amp;D can teach us about ethics, morality, metaphysics and more.<br/><br/>Illustrates a wide variety of philosophical concepts and ideas that arise in Dungeons &amp; Dragons gameplay and presents them in an accessible and entertaining manner<br/>Reveals how the strategies, tactics, improvisations, and role-play employed by D&amp;D enthusiasts have startling parallels in the real world of philosophy<br/>Explores a wide range of philosophical topics, including the nature of free will, the metaphysics of personal identity, the morality of crafting fictions, sex and gender issues in tabletop gameplay, and friendship and collaborative storytelling<br/>Provides gamers with deep philosophical insights that can lead to a richer appreciation of D&amp;D and any gaming experience</blockquote>\nMy chapter is about how we try to describe what happens in play, which turns out to be a philosophical issue since the description of lived experience is actually a challenging thing to do when you start to look at it more closely.

The focus on "lived experience" (or "lifeworld") is a feature of those approaches to psychology, sociology, anthropology, and other human sciences that are interested in describing what's going on in people's heads. This is called "phenomenology," where "phenomenon" means "a thing as it is perceived" (as compared to a thing as it is). Phenomenology brackets off the issue of how things really are, because all that's available to us is how we perceive them, and tries to generate accounts of what it's like to experience particular circumstances: What it's like to be an employee in a produce warehouse, or to be a mom who reads romance novels, or to suffer from a particular mental illness. <br/><br/>Or, what it's like to role-play. My chapter dips lightly into the kinds of descriptions of the experience of role-playing that one can find in accounts of play, suggesting that it's mainly non-visual (i.e., that we only occasionally spend a lot of time visualizing what's going on; more often we are feeling some kind of differentiated connection to our characters).<br/><br/>I'm sort of stealing a page from the Forge, where the concern for actual play manifested in a lot of attention to what was happening in players' heads as they tried to make things work.<br/><br/>I know you'll have follow-up questions, so shoot.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433112/#Comment_433112" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T08:12:47+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  8:12AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is very interesting. I will have to see if I can get it through a non-amazon source. Given that you're looking at the phenomenology of play how much time do you spend on different types of play? I'm wondering specifically if there is a substantial difference between playing with minis or not in terms of visualization for instance. The difference between playing in worlds drawn from visual media (like Star Wars) versus worlds without an outside visual depiction  also seems interesting. <br/><br/>I also have to post this because it is one of my favorite things. <br/><br/><a href="http://dresdencodak.com/2006/12/03/dungeons-and-discourse/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dresdencodak.com/2006/12/03/dungeons-and-discourse/</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433121/#Comment_433121" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T08:45:16+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  8:45AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I barely scratch the surface of those differences, Morgan. They are well worth exploring, though, and do have design implications. My goal was simply to say that a phenomenological approach to role-playing focuses our attention to how players describe their own play, and may produce results that are interesting for the philosophical (phenomenological) understanding of imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
