S7S has much more emphasis on cinematic and wild action and the non-minion characters are harder to defeat than in other PDQ iterations. JotSS pushes the pendulum on the other end, with classic PDQ damage, and adds a sickle to the pendulum if you choose the "Risk" or "DOOM!" danger levels for the scene or conflict.<br/><br/>I am really digging the magic systems laid out in each as well.  As a fan of the Castle Falkenstein game, I like the spin that JotSS puts on sorcery.  Gather and use is a more dangerous way to cast spells and makes you split resources to make sure you cover each - which will make spell casters very wary of pushing too hard unless desperate.  Now, your job is to make them desperate every so often...  <br/><br/>S7S's magic system is very evocative of its setting as well, and I look forward to peeking under the hood of it some more soon.  I do say I like the idea of the Gifted and the Koldun...and they are well integrated into the setting.<br/><br/>tl;dr: The two games are tweaked to their settings, in true PDQ fashion.  Both rock on toast for doing the tone and style of fantasy each deals with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200653/#Comment_200653" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T15:42:20+00:00" title="April  4, 2009  3:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, as long as I've got somebody's attention, maybe I can get some more answers.

Charms are locked spells and should have some impact to compensate for the lack of flexibility.<br/><br/>The purchase defaults to Average as the first rank you get (as a one rank penalty for magic) and the effects are all locked (but one selected aspect).  The use of the charm in a conflict, the paralysis would last one turn (using the time scale for conflicts), giving you the next hit free, basically.  Combat spells will likely rely on force or energy for effect (either defensive or offensive), so the range and length of effect will always be limited to the Average bases.  <br/><br/>My best advice is to be fairly strict with interpreting the effects, but do not be so strict that the cool of magic gets quashed.  This takes some adjusting, so don't expect to get the hang of it the first few on-the-fly uses of the chart.  For charms, though, think it through and be sure you choose the right "growing column" for the spell.  (ex. Paralysis might grow by duration or by area of effect, depending on the goal of the Charm.)  Since Charms are defined once, greater care should be taken that everyone understands their limits.<br/><br/>One additional idea for Charms would be to adjust some of the other columns by no more than one rank (subject to GM approval) - say drop the number of people to have the force increased (and then choose duration as your growing column).  That way, you get a Paralysis Charm that effects one person, with Good force (for terms of resisting the Charm), for a duration scaled to the Quality of the Charm.<br/><br/>Edit:  Also, ignore columns that do not play into the effect you are going for.  Force and Energy are often mutually exclusive.  Number of subjects and weight are usually incompatible as well.  I say "often" and "usually" because maybe the Charm converts a punch into a flame blast (having both force and energy) or a charm may take a number of people and reduce their weight (perhaps for featherfall?).  Do not get caught up working in columns that are not an aspect of the effect you are building.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200891/#Comment_200891" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T09:58:32+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  9:58AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>The use of the charm in a conflict, the paralysis would last one turn (using the time scale for conflicts), giving you the next hit free, basically.</blockquote>\nThis I find interesting.

For example, Average is described as "1 Turn (30 Minutes)", so an Average effect lasts either 1 turn in a  conflict or 30 minutes if a non-conflict effect.  For example, Invisibility would last 30 Mins, but a mystical armor spell would last a single turn on the conflict.<br/><br/>Tim, am I doing it right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201278/#Comment_201278" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-08T11:33:52+00:00" title="April  8, 2009 11:33AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, lovely!

(Hopefully leading to less getting locked up than in the original. I think that came from a World of Darkness game.)<br/><br/>To put it another way - trying to cover every eventuality with a one-size-fits-all table ain't going to work, so adapt. You'll probably find that some effects make more sense if they last a scene. Stuff that lasts just a turn is really quite tactical. That table is descended from the powers one in Truth &amp; Justice, via Questers, and maybe it would have benefited from a teensy bit more kidnapping of handsome strangers on the road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203060/#Comment_203060" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T19:55:16+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  7:55PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim Gray</cite>and maybe it would have benefited from a teensy bit more kidnapping of handsome strangers on the road.</blockquote>\nThat is a tremendous turn of phrase!
