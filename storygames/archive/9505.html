Since spies are easy to drum up interest for, WoM was the chosen game for our first meeting of the new Story Games Calgary club.<br/><br/>Character creation for WoM is quick and simple. Character have 5 stats, each with a \u201ccodename\u201d and a general description, which covers a broad area of espionage-type abilities. The stats are:<br/>Saturn, Team Leader;<br/>Mars, the Hitman;<br/>Mercury, the Faceman;<br/>Vulcan, the Fixer; and<br/>Pluto, the Shade.<br/><br/>The game favours specialized characters over generalists, making it so that the higher ranks of a given stat are cheaper than the lower ones; once you get started on a given tree, it\u2019s easier to climb higher. What that means is that it\u2019s best if there\u2019s some communication between players during character generation, to ensure that someone is specializing in each stat.<br/><br/>Our group consisted of Aaron, Roger, and Thomas. Thomas came late, but I\u2019m going to tell the story as if he was there the whole time, because it makes the narrative smoother. Aaron bought up points in Vulcan and Pluto, making a character that was stealthy and well-equipped with gadgetry. Roger made a beautiful killer, focusing on Mars and Mercury. Having two specialties each meant that they were very poorly represented in their other categories. Thomas specialized in Saturn, and was moderately competent at everything else.<br/><br/>Thus far, everything had proceeded as I \u2013 and presumably Wick \u2013 had expected. The characters were competent and dangerous, and the team was well-rounded. Then things went a little\u2026 awry.<br/>The next stage of the game is Planning. Spies in movies and novels are always well-prepared and seemingly able to deal with any complication. WoM simulates that by putting planning the mission \u2013 including the complications \u2013 into the hands of the players, rather than the GM (called Operations). Every detail the players add adds one \u201cmission point\u201d which can be used to enhance their regular stats or activate special abilities.<br/><br/>When the PCs are in a challenging situation, which the game calls \u201crisks\u201d, they roll a number of dice equal to the appropriate stat (Mars for killin\u2019, Vulcan for setting explosives or hacking, etc.) and compare their total roll to a chart which determines who gets narrative rights for the outcome. Low rolls give Operations full rights, and high rolls give full rights to the player. In between, narrative rights are subject to a \u201cveto\u201d, or a modifier, by the other party. A player might narrate themselves grabbing their enemy and beating him up, but Operations can say \u201cbut he\u2019s still conscious\u201d or \u201cand then another enemy agent steps into the room with a gun\u201d.<br/><br/>Special abilities basically allow the character who has the highest value in a given stat to automatically succeed in one risk of the appropriate type, except for Saturn, which can give another player a re-roll.<br/><br/>So, planning is where things went off the rails a bit.  Operations (me) give the PCs one simple objective. Mine was \u201cThere is a mole in the North Korean embassy in London, and you have to extract the mole.\u201d I left the details of who the mole was and why the mole needed extraction intentionally vague.<br/><br/>So, the players decided that since the PRK doesn\u2019t actually have an embassy in London, this would be a new embassy, just opened up as the PRK was making overtures of peace to the world. And the mole? Kim Jong-il\u2019s eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, bitter for being passed over by his father. All that was fine, until the PCs decided that they would be disguised as body doubles for Kim Jong-il, complete with the small stature and portly shape. In fact, they decided, they would be CLONES of the Glorious Leader, although genetically modified as part of Korea\u2019s super-soldier program; their genetics had been stolen or tampered with, however, and rather than being loyal to nation and party, they were working for the unnamed (presumably NATO-backed) intel organization that was helping Kim Jong-nam defect.<br/><br/>They explained how there would be too many protesters at the airport in London, so the younger Kim would be brought in by train, through the Chunnel from France. Then, while on the train, they would locate him, bring him to the back of the train, load him into their spy car, drop out the back of the train once it had surfaced on the English side, and drive the car into the back of a transport disguised as a double-decker bus.<br/><br/>All good. So I asked them what the complications they expected were. Well, of course, the threat of Jong-nam escaping with Korea\u2019s missile secrets and cloning project details was not only a risk to the PRK, but to the whole \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d! So the Iranians had put agents onto the train as well to prevent any such defections. Oh my. Oh, and the REAL Kim Jong-il was also on the train!<br/><br/>Once the mission details were set, they divvied up their mission points. The intent seems to be that players will tend to give extra points to PCs that they think will be called upon a lot (more points to the Hitman in a violent session) but the guys shared them more-or-less equally. Mission points allow a character to be competent in any area, even if it isn\u2019t their speciality, so everyone gets to be a cool spy, even when they are out of their element. As time passes, though, things get harder for the PCs. There are three different \u201ckeep the pressure on\u201d rules, and I used the simplest one, which was that every 20 minutes or real-time, each PC would lose one mission point.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210758/#Comment_210758" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-06T17:50:31+00:00" title="June  6, 2009  5:50PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part Two<br/><br/>Things started off smoothly; the guards on the French side of the Chunnel were not allowing the spies to load their vehicle onto the train. Obviously, since they all looked like Jong-il, the PCs had to be careful not to be seen together. So they split up, Roger (called Smiley Kimmy, now) convincing the guard to let them on with an excellent full-narrative-rights Mercury roll. Aaron (aka Silent Kimmy) slipped silently onto the cargo container of the train \u2013 using Pluto \u2013 and unloaded one of the cars already on-board. He failed with a veto, so I let him unload the car, but I put an Iranian agent in the back seat with a garrotte!<br/><br/>Deciding to run with the growing campiness, I put my Iranian spies in white linen suits with bald heads and obviously sinister \u201cvizier beards\u201d. Aaron then used his veto to ensure that his flabby Kim Jong-il jowls blocked the wire from his throat, allowing him to fight back! He then rolled an excellent Vulcan test, using the automatic seats of the car to trap the Iranian, and then slipped quietly out of the car.<br/><br/>Once on board, the team began deploying their assets. They used Pluto to sneak around, but not without some complication. Thomas (playing Big Kimmy, having decided that his character was designed for TV appearances, and was thus much taller than the real Glorious Leader) got caught in a hallway by an Iranian, and barely managed to sneak into a room to get out of sight\u2026 but my veto made it so that it was the room of a French reporter on the train to try and get a few pics of the famed dictator\u2019s family.<br/><br/>Big Kimmy then sprung his trap, attacking the Iranian, but not successfully enough to prevent me from having the spy pull a scimitar (\u201cwhere was he hiding that?\u201d was the chorus from the players; I reminded them that it was their idea to be espionage-themed clones of a tubby 5\u20192\u201d dictator) and counter-attack, driving Big Kimmy into the reporter\u2019s room. The reporter gleefully took pictures and started emailing them to his editor (does the Chunnel have wifi? I assumed it must). Big Kimmy rolled a powerful Mars, and dropped the white-suited spy.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Smiley Kimmy asked a concierge for a tour of the train. The bewildered employee took the spy around the train, showing him all the passenger cars and the control room\u2026 where he saw Big Kimmy scrapping with an Iranian via the CCTV.<br/><br/>Silent Kimmy used Vulcan to rig up some explosives on the younger Kim\u2019s car in the cargo compartment, so that if anything went wrong, they could blow open the car doors and rescue him. Success, but my veto introduced another Iranian agent, who used some kind of gadget to steal the detonation frequency of the explosive, and then ran off into the train. Silent Kimmy gave chase.<br/><br/>At this point, I decided to use the game\u2019s Trust mechanic.<br/><br/>Smiley Kimmy distracted the train staff from the security feed (using Mercury) and then ran back to the passenger cars to help Big Kimmy deal with the now-dead Iranian. Big Kimmy used Saturn to terrify the reporter into giving up his laptop (we decided that since Saturn is for leadership, that intimidation would fall into that category rather than Mercury, which tends to be more subtle). They picked the dead enemy agent up and carried him, Weekend and Bernie\u2019s-style, back to the cargo compartment. They rolled Pluto to keep it subtle\u2026 and my veto introduced a lone porter.<br/><br/>Smiley Kimmy hit the porter with Mercury, and rolled fairly well, but I was still able to use my veto to declare that the porter was not truly a rail employee, but a PRK plant! And recognizing that tow Kim Jong-ils in one place \u2013 especially toting a dead Iranian \u2013 was a bad sign! And he ran for help. Smiley Kimmy easily dispatched the poor guy with Mars, though. They hid both bodies in the trunks of cars.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Silent Kimmy had lost track of the Iranian agent, but tapped into the train\u2019s CCTV network with Vulcan to locate their passenger compartment. He then used Vulcan to remotely lock all the doors of the compartment and notify security (there\u2019s security on this crazy train?), but my veto allowed the Iranians to escape through a window, crawling on top of the train (yes, in the Chunnel. By this point we had all completely given in to the campy-monster in each of us).<br/><br/>It was at this point that I decided to spring the game\u2019s Trust mechanic on the players. WoM simulates the tension and distrust of the spy genre by giving players bonus \u201ctrust dice\u201d to actions that specifically betray another character. Because I hadn\u2019t explained that to the group beforehand, I just gave some of them \u201csecret orders\u201d. Silent Kimmy was informed by email that Big Kimmy might still be loyal to the PRK, and Smiley Kimmy was told that Silent Kimmy might well be working for the Iranians! On the note I just put \u201cget +1 die when acting against that character\u201d. Technically, the game allows the PCs to get trust dice from betraying Operations as well, but I didn\u2019t want to add too much complication.<br/><br/>Smiley, now distrusting  Silent, unloaded all of Silent\u2019s explosives gear from the back of the spy car, using everything to set up an explosion to blow the doors off the back of the cargo container, out of which they could escape.<br/><br/>With everything in place, the team started to move. And move against each other! Big and Silent took up positions at the back of the train, getting ready to blow the doors and escape. Smiley Kimmy went to the first-class car and told the leader of the security detail that he was the real Kim Jong-il, but that there was an impostor at the back of the train, ready to try and assassinate him! An excellent Mercury roll gave him success, and the guards all ran off, except for the personal bodyguards of the real Jong-il and Jong-nam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210759/#Comment_210759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-06T17:50:53+00:00" title="June  6, 2009  5:50PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part Three<br/><br/>The guards reached the back, and Silent used his Pluto special ability to disappear. The special abilities hadn\u2019t been used much, but mission points were running low, so the players wanted to use them if they got the chance. Big rolled Pluto, and ducked in and out of cars avoiding the PRK troops, but my veto allowed me to re-introduce the Iranian agents, who came in shouting and looking to kill everyone! Silent was prepared, though, and he used Vulcan to blow up the explosive he had on Jong-nam\u2019s car, removing most of the hostiles from the equation.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Smiley walked, bold as brass, up to the Kims and their bodyguards, and unloaded an amazing Mars roll, gunning down all the bodyguards, blasting open the windows of the train, and grabbing the younger Kim, pretending to take him hostage \u2013 keep in mind that Smiley looks just like Kim Jong-il, but with much nicer teeth. He then used Mercury to convince the Glorious Leader that he was, in fact, kidnapping the man\u2019s son, and Roger narrated a great scene where the younger Kim, sobbing, told his father that he only wanted him to be proud. Kim Jong-il, his hair and jowls, fluttering in the wind of the ruined train, resigned himself to his son\u2019s capture\u2026 for now. They fled to the back of the train.<br/><br/>Big got the spy car running, and Smiley blew the doors. I got narrative rights (one of the few times all session), so I said that the explosion blasted the spy car out of the back of the train. Roger used his veto in an amusing way, to actually harm the team, but saying that the crash blew out the tires of the spy car, forcing it to stay on the rails (yes, the car\u2019s rims were just the right distance to sit on the rails).<br/><br/>Feeling invincible, Big jammed the wheel and gas of the car, keeping it moving along the track and opened the top, standing in the driver\u2019s seat and holding out his hand to Jung-nam. A roll of Vulcan (for leadership and inspiration) got the defector into the spy car, and then the other spies jumped in without trouble.<br/><br/>I took over for the epilogue, stating that after the train had gotten a sufficient distance, Smiley shot a track-switch lever, allowing the spy car to turn off onto another track, and meet up with the double-decker spy bus.<br/><br/>The end?<br/><br/>So, overall, I really liked the mechanics, pacing, and structure of WoM. We ran into a few snags (we weren\u2019t sure at first if PCs could earn more mission points mid-mission. A re-reading of the section makes it pretty clear that they can\u2019t), but for the most part we didn\u2019t have nay trouble figuring out what was going on. Mission points as a resource were hoarded at first, and it wasn\u2019t until they started disappearing behind the ticking clock that the players really started using them. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a skill to cover general athleticism (jumping, climbing, etc), although that\u2019s dealt with largely due to the fact that athletic feats are usually a mean, rather than an ends, and will generally fall into either Mars or Pluto.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t know if anyone expected the game to be utterly insane and camp. Just from reading the game, I had no idea it could even be played that way. Up until the PCs were a team of cloned Kim Jong-ils, anything could\u2019ve gone. After that, it was fight the current or run with it, and run we did.<br/><br/>There isn\u2019t really any provision for campaign play. There\u2019s no real way for the characters to change or advance, so you would have PCs filling the same roles in tale after tale. Still, with some time to prep, the group could easily come up with some other form of play-reward, like status or personal goals for characters to pursue. Personal goals would be very interesting, because players would therefore always be keen to find ways to tie their personal goals into the mission planning.<br/><br/>Overall, it took us about 3 hours to play; 1 hour for character creation and planning, and 2 to actually play.<br/><br/>I call this a win for SGC!

And for running the game, of course.  This is my feedback and random thoughts about it.<br/><br/>Mechanics<br/><br/>As Adam says, they're pretty much entirely narration-rights mechanics, which I'm starting to think are a bit weak when unsupported by more concrete resolution mechanics.  Something like PTA, which tells you who succeeds and fails as well as who gets to narrate, pulls it off better, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the mechanics were to blame or just that we were generally really lucky, but it seemed like we succeeded a lot more than we failed.  We were generally rolling 5d6 requiring a total of 16 or high for full rights.  That averages to 17.5, so I guess it's not too surprising.<br/><br/>As a result, all of the "+1 die" mechanics felt a bit superfluous and didn't really add all that much to the experience.<br/><br/>All that being said, it worked well as a conch-passing game, so if that's what it's meant to be, it succeeded.<br/><br/>Silliness<br/><br/>Ah, the silliness.  I'm not sure exactly what happened, but I have some ideas.<br/><br/>First of all, this was the first time I'd played an RPG with these folks.  I think the other 3 had played together before, but I'm not really sure -- Adam can probably clarify that.  So it sort of had a bit of a "first date" vibe; nothing too serious or too intimate.<br/><br/>And speaking of that, I guess I personally do have a tendency to avoid any real emotional content in games by hiding behind silliness, so I'll keep an eye on that in the future.<br/><br/>I didn't really have a good handle on what Adam (or anyone else) was expecting in terms of genre or tone.  It's probably something worth discussing at some point if there's the chance it could all go off the rails.<br/><br/>The whole clone thing... well.  Here's the thing about me in particular and this sort of phase of a game in general.  If we're in something like "Let's all come up with some ideas and concepts and details for the spy mission" to my brain that sounds like brainstorming.  And I'm a big believer in the "lots of ideas including lots of bad ideas" school of brainstorming.  So, yeah, I'm going to toss out some pretty bad and crazy stuff like we're all clones of Kim Jong-il.  But that doesn't really mean I think it's a good idea or anything that I feel committed to.  It's all still free-and-clear at that point, in my opinion; there's time enough to decide what's REALLY true after the brainstorm is wrapped up.<br/><br/>All of that being said, I have to say I had a really wonderful and hilarious time playing at a high silliness level; it reminded me of everything RPG play has the potential to be.  so I have no regrets.<br/><br/>Being Kim Jong-il<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting it, but there's something sort of magical in the premise.  Having everyone as Kim clones really worked.<br/><br/>It also meant that we basically had to keep the party split up at all times, which worked out surprisingly well.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of untapped potential here; I might spend some more time thinking and writing about what it could be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210912/#Comment_210912" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T10:11:52+00:00" title="June  8, 2009 10:11AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2009 10:14AM by deadlytoque.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Thomas and Aaron are two guys I game with regularly, as well as being two of my closest friends.

That said, it's genre-appropriate, in that spies in fiction rarely fail when they are doing the things they are best at. Still, some level of subtlety in outcome might have made that smoother. Having read this and <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, I get the feeling that Wick used WoM as a sounding-ground for HotB, since HotB has a very similar resolution mechanic (roll and add a pool of dice based on a stat to win narrative rights) but with much more room for fine-tuning outcomes (basic success allows you to narrate ONE fact; you have to hold back dice from your roll to get more facts, so you reduce your chances of success, but at the risk of increasing your dramatic/narrative control).<br/><br/>The silliness was not something I was expecting, but definitely not something I was opposed to. I think it made that first session a lot more comfortable and team-buildy that a more tense/graphic/serious game might have. That said, WoM does not have a gameplay aide as written that allows any GM control over tone. The GM sets the mission, and the players run with everything else. It might be worth adding something, if one were going to play this game more frequently, like "each player at the table including the GM gets a single veto which can be used to negate any other element of the mission" or even just a pre-planning step wherein basic assumptions are agreed upon. The spy genre means many things to many people.<br/><br/>The party-split thing is an inevitability in espionage games if you ask me. It's a natural result of the genre's tendency towards super-specialists, and it's one of the greatest (if not the single greatest) flaws with games like <i>Spycraft</i> and <i>Shadowrun</i> which don't allow for quick resolution of scenes once the party has split. Anyone who has ever sat impatiently while the party's Wheelman played an exciting chase or the Runner hacked the corp's security (and then sat on the sidelines during the rest of the session) know what I mean.<br/><br/>Roger: I think we should play a short campaign of HotB at some point (6-10 sessions) and then compare the differences in the resolution mechanic and its relative strengths and weaknesses vis a vis espionage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
