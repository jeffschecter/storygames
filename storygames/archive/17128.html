Which means we play every monday, and have had a few extra evenings when we can arrange a few players to get together.<br/><br/>Main question I have now - how can I better promote "non-character sheet based progression"?<br/><br/>unpacking a little: All my players seem very focused on "XP to get more powers on the sheet". Is this a bad thing? Not sure. How are some ways to promote fictinal positioning - getting more abilities in the story-world that dont rely on dots on sheet? (ie, get invested more in the story?) Get them more interested in exploring the fictional-world?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388802/#Comment_388802" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T05:41:48+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  5:41AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good question. I don't know. Maybe if we unpack it and look at the parts we could get somewhere.<br/><br/>The characters have the mindset of someone starting a business. They're interested in bringing in more profit. At the same time you're looking at the story and saying "there are so many riches here". Something like the spouse that is trying to get the businessperson to pay attention to their family more. I'm not criticizing what you're trying to do. I've tried to do the same. It's just I imagined this comparison when I read the post.<br/><br/>How do you get the business minded player to stop focusing so much on XP? Usually the mindset is that they'd like to if they could only accomplish what they want and still have the time, they would. In this case, as a GM you can pretty much print money, so you could just give them the XP they want so they have the powers they want but that doesn't sound very satisfying.<br/><br/>It would probably be better to pay them for taking up activities you want them to engage in. For instance, make an XP reward for making allies. How about one for discovery? Make their goal happen with your goal.<br/><br/>That's my $0.02                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388804/#Comment_388804" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T06:05:14+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  6:05AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What system are you playing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/swavomeer" title="swavomeer"><img alt="swavomeer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/642/n9D042GBVCM5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/swavomeer">swavomeer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388805/#Comment_388805" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T06:07:20+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  6:07AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That depends how you define character sheets.

They have moved to new york and are dealing with things happening around them.<br/><br/>Each session i begin with the XP. Its a pool that is divided amongst those present.<br/>2xp per character present last session.<br/>2xp for each "important fact your character has learnt"<br/>I also have "goals". and each session that they group spends on a goal makes it worth more. When they complete the goal they get 2xp per session they spent on it.<br/><br/>So the XP log for a session might look as follows:<br/>   (4 players) +8xp <br/>Goals<br/>   What is the "joint project" (2 incomplete)<br/>   Cure sidekick (1 complete +2xp)<br/>   Setup Safehouse (4 complete +8xp)<br/><br/>Facts:<br/>   Werewolves are living in central park (+2)<br/>   Red Door Club is run by a spider-spirit (+2)<br/>   Lizzy (mage) is able to communicate with spirits (+2)<br/><br/>+24 xp for group.<br/><br/>I encourage the group to set their own goals, and follow through on them. Basically its a pointer for me to make sessions about those goals. The facts are things the players picked up during the last session, and think are important. They act as pointers to me to re-integrate those facts back into the game (also gives me a handy list of what the characters know).<br/><br/>This is working really well so far (everyone is very enthusiastic to play more, and they are invested in what they are doing), but they are still asking for more XP so they can get more "powers"... while i really am interested more in their interactions with the people and places around them....<br/><br/>Am i just finding a problem where there is none?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388856/#Comment_388856" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T13:56:08+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  1:56PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why is this "non-character sheet" stuff?<br/><br/>Tell them to write their fictional positioning on the sheet.

Then the next week they are telling me about how they baked cookies and want to find some random person in town to talk about something tangential. I also tell them during character creation\u2014when they ask me where to write something\u2014that it's their sheet and they should put whatever they want on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388859/#Comment_388859" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T14:53:00+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  2:53PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you let them spent that xp on their sidekick's character sheet... and even get more sidekicks, minions, helpers, people working for them instead of having their characters become more powerful. Take it like their characters can't be improved further but they can get more resources in the form of posessions and armies. I'd say if they have the XP, that means they have made the connections and are making a reputation of their own. It means scalating the conflict, perhaps quite quickly by the amount of XP they are getting. But it also means there would be more things in the setting that matter more to them. Building an empire eventually makes you like that empire and it makes you go a long way to protect it. But anyway, that depends on how your group likes to have their fun. If you can't move them from the concept of having more power in a single character to have more power in a lot of them, it won't matter so don't sweat it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388862/#Comment_388862" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T15:13:53+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  3:13PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2012 3:17PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting you bring this up Dionysus since I was reading some of the posts on <a href="http://www.oldschoolhack.net/page/5/" rel="nofollow">Kirin Robinson's Old School Hack site</a> and he brings up the idea of 'lateral leveling'.<br/><br/>It got me thinking about the primary D&amp;D4E campaign I had going a few years ago. The PC's were up to level 9 and everyone was firmly entrenched in the paradigm of gaining more XP to level for bonuses and powers. Then I had a rich quest giver reward the group with a farmstead along one of the main trade routes leading into the city and their focus completely changed. All of a sudden, they didn't care so much about assaulting the evils below the Seven Pillared Hall and really just wanted to build their own settlement out of the farmstead.<br/><br/>Since they seemed to be so interested in the "Sim City" aspect of the game we stumbled on, I created some simple rules for creating new buildings like a tavern and a general store, gathering resources via their hired hands like wood and ore, increasing output via things like windmills and a water wheel, hiring craftsmen and prostitutes to attract more travels, and so on. It was really fun and gave us a great way to break up the "monotony" of adventuring. We never ended up finishing the campaign since the combats were getting longer more complicated as they leveled up, but it was great while it lasted.<br/><br/>It was fun enough for me to consider creating a game centered around this type of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
