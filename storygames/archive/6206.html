It was pretty super-cool, and surprised me in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>Every Capes game I've played so far (a handful, scattered over a year or so with different participants) has had a hefty dose of The Silly. And The Silly was always genuinely enjoyable, hilarious even, and didn't even preclude some genuine moments of pathos, but rather coexisted with it in a kind of entertainment ecosystem. All well and good. But I wanted a Capes game with a bit more Gravitas, and told the players so. And they were obliging enough to work with me to create exactly that!<br/><br/>I set the game firmly in the Bronze Age, the "comics grow up" era of the late 70s-early 80s with a bit grimmer, more real-world-issue stories. I was specifically thinking of Byrne Fantastic Four, and drove toward that. So I told everyone Doctor Calamitous was attempting to breach the sanctum of the Justice Citadel, and dared the Justice Guard to stop me.<br/>So here's how it went down, in brief:<br/><br/><i>Doctor Calamitous <b>(played by me</b>) is an age-old foe of the Justice Guard, encased in runed armor to keep his soul from escaping to hell and damning the earth. He stormed the Justice Citadel intent on breaching it to satisfy some desire mysteriously related to his Faustian origin. He was allied with Solaron the Avenging Star <b>(played by Willem)</b>, a celestial body compressed and encased in a robot body, out to destroy petty human civilization before we enslave our sun as his people did to him.<br/><br/>On hand to guard the inner Sanctum (the other Justice Guardians were, of course, away on a mission) were Buzzbomb <b>(played by Frank)</b>, superstrong but now aging champion from Dubbya-Dubbya Two, Mjumba <b>(played by Gilbert)</b>, African Bush hunter sworn to protect the wilds of the world, and Morgan the Mindbender <b>(played by Jennifer)</b>, mysterious adventurer who traveled  the world and obtained the secrets of enlightenment and evolved consciousness.<br/><br/>When the two villains set foot on the front steps, the compound went into emergency alert and servant robots began shuffling civilians (the aboveground facility serves as a museum/tourist attraction) to safety. In the first round we had three goals appear: "Penetrate Inner Sanctum," "Get Civilians to safety," and "Restore Buzzbomb's reputation as a hero." Buzzbomb and Mjumba tussled with the Doc and Solaron at the entrance, while Morgan remained in his meditation chamber in the sanctum and provided mental assistance. Some choice bits: Buzzbomb takes time from pitched batle to make sure the monitoring equipment is running, and makes a big show f standing up to the baddies in front of onlookers; meanwhile, Mjumba is daring the <i>Robiticized Living Sun</i> to face him in single combat, and attempts to wrestle the behemoth, ignoring the searing heat.<br/><br/>The two villains swept all opposition before them, until Morgan the Mindbender manipulated them and turned them against each other.Still they forged on, Calamitous still seeking entry to the sanctum, and Solaron heading for the base reactor--to free it (catastrophically!) from its human enslavement. Buzzbomb was making an ass of himself posing for the crowd, but when Mjumba upbraided him for his cowardly grandstanding, the aging hero pulled it together and lanched an all-out attack on the Star-bot. Calamitous meanwhile had penetrated the Sanctum and claimed that it was Professor Quantum, the JG's resident scientist (in absentia), who was responsible for his terrible transformation long ago. To end his curse, he was prepared to sacrifice the Mindbender in Quantum's place. . .but he lost control of the incantation, sending despair-energy coursing through the complex, severely shaking Buzzbomb far above in his last-ditch struggle. The evil Doctor collapsed, a broken man, while Buzzbomb put the kibosh on Solaron (newly enslaved as the Guard's new power source!). . .but to only halfhearted kudos from the onlookers, who were dazed and disillusioned by the ups and downs of the struggle. We ended on a note of anguish and doubt as Buzzbomb stood slumped and alone in his victorywondering to him self: "I saved the day--didn't I? I'm a hero-aren't I?"<br/><br/>The end! (for now. . .)</i><br/><br/>Some things that popped out to me about the session:<br/><br/>First, this was the grimmest Capes game i've ever played, and I loved it! I asked for a certain tone from the other players, and I got it! Thanks, everyone (if you're reading)! There were definitely some things that made us laugh (mostly Buzzbomb's egregious grandstanding), but it wasn't. . .silly. It was humor naturally flowing from a dire situation.<br/><br/>Second, we had a great mix of Hero and Villain characters for a nice matrix of conflicts.  The introduction of the "restore Buzzbomb's reputation" goal meant the heroes were divided over an issue critical to the action, elevating the story beyond a mere beat-em-up. Mjumba rolled against Buzzbomb's rep at first, then backed him up when he saw true courage awaken in him. The villains never had opposing goals <i>exactly,</i> but Morgan was able to sow enough dissent that they tripped on themselves. It reminded me of great Super-villain teamp-ups of old, like Magneto and the Sub-mariner. One thing to note is that we never had any conflicts beyond the initial 3. If we'd had more time to fight it out, we could've played out a couple more goals like "Doctor Calamitous succeeds in his sacrificial ritual." but instead we just folded actions that could've been their own goals into the existing conflicts, and it worked fine.<br/><br/>One weird thing that happened: the Heroes ended up with all the Story tokens! This is a first for me; the usual rhythm of Capes is, Villain starts a big, grabby conflict, Heroes all go "Oh no you didn't" and win the conflict, Villain reaps juicy story tokens to put toward a conflict he cares about more. Instead, "Penetrate the Sanctum" resolved early in the villains' favor, so that the Heroes ended up with all the tokens, which they used to pull a victory (mostly) out in the final hour.<br/><br/>I noted that the ability of a character to influence a conflict from afar ran pretty smoothly in play. I'd never seen this feature in action before, so it was a treat. Morgan conducted most of his defense from a meditative trance two miles underground, and Dr. Calamitous' despair waves from the failed ritual did a number on Buzzbomb's quest to prove himself. Great fun!<br/><br/>The last thing: we made awesome use of a Deadlocked conflict. Despite using all their Story Tokens in a desperate effort, the Heroes found themselves at a stalemate with the villains regarding "Does Buzzbomb restore his rep?" Ordinarily we could've taken it to another page, but since we were about three minutes till the end of our timeslot, we let the tie stand. This made an awesome closer for the game: Buzzbomb's terrible isolation and doubt. A "final panel" just chock full of pathos and dangling questions.<br/><br/>As a first con experience, this game was delightful. I'd only met one player before (and played before with <i>none</i> of them), but we all gelled well I thought, and drove creatively and fearlessly toward a cool and fun story we could all be proud of.<br/><br/>God, I love Capes.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS. Willem posted this <a href="http://www.rewild.info/conversations/index.php?topic=836.msg9219#msg9219" rel="nofollow">awsome though Solaron-centric account</a> on another forum. Truly stirring! Also Willem, I alopogize, if Solaron's enslavement was passed over too quickly, it was only in the interest of time. Thanks for playing!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137861/#Comment_137861" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T10:07:35+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:07AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha ha.
