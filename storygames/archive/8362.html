I hadn't played it before (and neither had they) but I was keen because of the whole quick-prep thing combined with the idea that it's easily extended into an ongoing thing without a big time commitment up front.<br/><br/>Anyway, we decided we wanted to play something intrigue-y, and picked the Nest of Vipers oracle. We came up with a situation involving a band of pirate raiders in a small town at the crux of some trade routes and their rivalry with the local merchants. It took a few minutes to get the idea of Best Interests across, but the both of the players (who I'll call C and R) managed to come up with what seemed to me like two good ones, both putting them into conflict with other characters in areas which weren't their best. I had four or five NPCs with Best Interests mostly aimed at making life a pain for the PCs.<br/><br/>So, we started playing, and stuff happened, and the story gradually developed, but it was damned hard to get any sort of conflict started. There were plenty of heated discussions and plotting and negotiating, but since none of that stuff leads to conflicts in IaWA, it didn't feel like it led to much in the way of development. We only had two dice conflicts, both with the same PC against the same NPC, one of which the PC won in the first round and the other of which the NPC took the advantage die in the first round and then ran away handily with the rest of the conflict. I looked for opportunities to throw PCs into conflicts, but couldn't come up with any more where I didn't feel that suddenly springing an action scene of some sort on them would have been a violation of what we knew about the status quo.<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking that we did the genre wrong. Does IaWA work when the characters are prone to talking and negotiating over everything and never getting their hands dirty? Should I have just pushed harder and had some NPCs try to start a fight or otherwise goad the PCs into concrete action, even if it felt forced?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184783/#Comment_184783" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T07:23:47+00:00" title="December 24, 2008  7:23AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell us more about the best interests; per the book (pg 6), did the PCs target NPCs where they're strong, and did NPCs ruthlessly threaten the PCs where they're weak?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184788/#Comment_184788" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T08:28:45+00:00" title="December 24, 2008  8:28AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There were heated discussions, but the one side always just folded?  That may be best interests not enough at stake (not crossing each other), may also be "do folks realize they signed up to be in a story and in a story it gets interesting when someone doesn't just fold."  As GM, if you put the sworn enemies face to face over something they don't agree about, you're pretty much done your job - if they decide to have tea and split it evenly, well not much you can do.<br/><br/>Also there has been some talk about what forms of force/coercion/violence you can represent in the game.<br/><br/>I've had games where 1/2 the conflicts weren't knives and wrasslin, but rather trash talking in front of an audience whose views would essentially "force" the decision (it wasn't about convincing the other of your argument, it was about humiliating/tricking the other with your words so that audience would agree with you).

The NPCs were written to make sure I could use them to attack the players, but two things went wrong: first I slipped up on a couple and ended up in a conflict where, although the NPC was strong, the PC was also strong, and just shut him down on the first round; second, I think I had the NPCs respond too willingly to the PCs machinations, getting them involved in their non-fighty plans and therefore making me unwilling to break ranks and start fighting properly. I think next time I GM this I'll try to make sure there's at least one NPC who's at odds with <i>everyone</i>, so I'm guaranteed a way of stirring up trouble if things get slow.<br/><br/>Ralph: I don't think I missed opportunities for rolling dice. The closest the two PCs came to being in conflict was an argument which culminated with the pirate king drawing his sword, but the merchant walked away at that point and the king let him go. The two conflicts that did happen were when the pirate king's lieutenant tried to stab him in the back while they were fighting some guards on a boat they were raiding (but the pirate king outmaneuvered him) and then later when the king tried to hunt him down to extract vengeance (he ran away; this was all the player's ploy to distract attention while the NPC he'd allied himself with was kidnapping the merchant's daughter, but she was an NPC too and all that happened offscreen. After they planned it all out, I didn't feel like it would have been fair to deliberately have the NPC screw up just to bring him into conflict with the merchant.

If someone isn't going to beat the fuck out of someone else then the rules aren't going to help you a lot. <br/><br/>One of the things that I've found helps get the game into this mode is to have an NPC (or two, or ten) who is going to start punching first, fast, and always. It works sort of on Raymond Chandler's dictate of "having two men with a gun come through the door." When the PCs get too soft footed, to working things out through negotiation and open, honest dialog and all those things we want in real life and not in S&amp;S fiction, someone comes and is going to kill the fuck out of someone else. <br/><br/>The other thing about this style of game is that its all about fucking up the status quo. You've got merchants and pirates locked in a status quo? Dude, you've got to shake up the status quo. If the players won't do it, then someone else will. Someone is going to kill the pirate king (is it a pirate? a merchant? a pirate working for a merchant?), set fire to a merchant's house, and do something else. If you have a status quo situation, the story is going to happen when someone take the decisive action to fuck over the status quo. <br/><br/>So when you say "I didn't feel that suddenly springing an action scene of some sort on them would have been a violation of what we knew about the status quo" it leaves me wanting details. When did you establish this status quo? Where were the best interests of the PCs and NPCs in relation to it? Who was being fucked by the status quo and would knife someone to change it? <br/><br/>Also, in the conflicts you did have, how did you resolve them when the beat down happened? Because really, a conflict in which someone gets kicked around often leads to other conflicts, but it sounds like in your game they ended flat or ended things totally, without spinning off into further obsession and madness. So what happened with them? Who negotiated what, and how did it hit the fiction? Like, after the dude tried to stab the captain in the back, what happened to the dude and the captain and the rest of the crew?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The players negotiated as soon as violence was on the table. But to really engage fully, the characters are going to go one step further. What if the guy couldn't concede the argument that easily? What if he fought tooth and nail? That's when the negotiation gets <em>really</em> interesting.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>After they planned it all out, I didn't feel like it would have been fair to deliberately have the NPC screw up just to bring him into conflict with the merchant.

If characters make a promise in negotiation, it's exactly like if a person makes a promise: they determine if they're going to keep it. If negotiation gives you a hostage, then they're more likely to keep it than not, probably. If you're promising things without being forced to make those promises, you're not getting the system to fire on all cylinders. If you're not <em>actively extracting changes from characters</em> when negotiating, you're not negotiating hard enough.</p>\n<p>I recommend that, if the characters are negotiating and not getting their hands dirty, that they make good use of particular strengths that give them far-reaching abilities. Spies, bribery, reputations, what-have-you. That way, the characters can """keep their hands clean""" (that gets <em>extra</em> sarcasm quotes) while their agents do the dirty work.</p>\n<p>If they <em>don't</em> have such strengths, you should be making them wish they did. In the game, assassins, spies, extorted ex-lovers and current seducees are either strengths or weaknesses. They are represented in best interests and particular strengths. Make sure they're there and the players care about them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184837/#Comment_184837" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T12:12:34+00:00" title="December 24, 2008 12:12PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My standard for playing In A Wicked Age.... is this: Is there a weapon involved?

You can't ever say what another person's character does in IAWA. There's never a point where the other person has to give in and do what you want them to. You may want to coerce them, but if they hold steadfast, they can do that straight through to their death.<br/><br/>1.  "Give me your sandwich." "No, I like my sandwich."<br/><br/>2.  "I take your sandwich by force." "No you don't."<br/><br/>3.  (roll roll roll) "There, I win. Let's negotiate, I take your sandwich." "Like hell, you injure me instead."<br/><br/>4.  "Okay, I injure you." (write on character sheet) <br/><br/>5.  If not dead, "Now, I take your sandwich by even more force." "No you don't."<br/><br/>6.

Your job is to evaluate if your character would capitulate and the decision is completely yours.

In the wicked age you say what your own character does and if someone interferes, then you go to dice over the concrete actions and consequences to determine who's injured or exhausted. You can say "Bob's character falls in love" but it doesn't <i>mean anything</i>. It's just table talk, and everyone is free to ignore it.<br/><br/>Most critically, you never, ever "have a conflict" to "see if you fall in love with me."

In Dogs if you go to a conflict because you want to make some other character love you and you win the conflict, that other character loves you. In Nine Worlds, ditto. In PTA, ditto. In Other Game With Stakes Resolution, probably ditto. <br/><br/>So folks play IAWA and treat the initial condition that started the conflict as stakes.  Which works, so long as you never, as a group, push on it in any way or have anyone have a problem with rolling with it. But once someone does that, things get wonky fast. (It can also limit the scope of your actions to treat the initial condition as stakes. You could start out trying to force someone to marry you, and end up half the world away freezing to death by the end of the conflict in IAWA, but if you limit the actions to resolution of the initial state you'll never get that.)<br/><br/>Really, I think a good part of the confusion is that people expect IAWA to play like most of the other Story Games they've played, and it doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185936/#Comment_185936" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T12:08:13+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 12:08PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note also how "I fall in love with you" means nothing in actual terms of what happens.

I do stuff like that in Polaris sometimes ("but only if you add "your love for me" as an aspect).<br/><br/>I'm leery of it in IAWA though. The text says not to negotiate for improvements to the winner's sheet, and I think the logic carries through to the loser's sheet as well. If you've the ability to negotiate improvements (which PS are, even if mixed) as well as the stick, it radically shifts the nature of negotiation. <br/><br/>Now, that said, for some other iteration of the Anthology Engine, there may be something to the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8362/iawa-not-fighty-enough" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8362/iawa-not-fighty-enough" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8362/iawa-not-fighty-enough/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8362%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8362%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
