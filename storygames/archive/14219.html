The basic plan is, for ethical and legal reasons, that they're done in such a way that it requires having copies of the original book(s) for the translations to be usable. So, this thread has two main parts to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, what projects like that are already out there, and how far along are they? I'm aware of Ryuu Tama, but not how complete it is. Anybody have a list? Anything that people want to show-off?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, I am hankering to do a little project of my own. I'd love help of course, but I'm certainly willing to put the time in. See, I got some French RPGs for my birthday last year, and I'd like to actually play around with them. <br/>\nI have:<br/>\nAgone's Les Automnins<br/>\nAnoe<br/>\nSable Rouge<br/>\nPatient 13<br/>\nMahamoth<br/>\nI've done a little work on a couple of them, but I need some motivation to get any real work done. Knowing myself, the best way to do that is to work with others. So, which one first... and who wants to help? Please?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simonwolf" title="simonwolf"><img alt="simonwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/2081/minisparrow.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simonwolf">simonwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322704/#Comment_322704" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-02T20:52:38+00:00" title="May  2, 2011  8:52PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maid RPG was one of the early Japanese role-playing games that was translated into English.

Also, I'm the admin here! Story Games (the forum(tm)) only exists because I was procrastinating doing the initial translation of TBZ. Oh, and Ewen helped out with some of the sections of TBZ in their first run, although now I can't remember which (Ewen, do you recall?).<br/><br/>And likewise, Ewen did like 98% of the translation of Maid, to which I basically added/edited/rewrote a little, relocalized a bit later (INFAMY!), and the like. I produced/backed it, but Ewen's the real hero behind Maid.<br/><br/>Ewen is doing a new project which will hopefully be out maybe at the end of this year or beginning of next (is it official yet Ewen?), a project with strong connections to Maid, and a game totally unlike anything here in the West in concept and theme (I'd also say "mechanics", but I'm sure there's something out there that may have similarities). It's very exciting.<br/><br/>I am backing Matthew Sanchez's (who is basically a league better/faster at translation than I am, which is exXxtreme, and also a very nice and talented guy) translation of <b>Ryuutama</b>. He is "complete enough to play", with some sections drafted out in detail enough to play, while others (like the GM section I translated) is a perfect translation straight from the book. It's a living project: If you want a copy of Ryuutama, you would contact me (I'm about to make a Purchase Page, on my last trip to Japan I picked up about 12 copies of the game) and buy it. Then I would direct you to Matthew Sanchez to donate to him for his translation effort (Hey, he just got married, send him some Congrats Cash). <br/><br/>When you donate about $20 or whatever you feel, he'll add you to a mailing list that gets the English translation of the files, plus as time goes on and he adds content (either more accurate translations, prettier character sheets etc), you will get updated to location. Finally, one cool thing done was that he lists the monster descriptions but not the stats: So you need a copy of the original text to reference those stats. So even if it spreads in its current form on pirate sites, it's "copy protected" as much as those old PC games where you needed to reference the manuals.<br/><br/>Still, another thought (and one I might do with the game Sword World 2.0) is to basically buy up 100 or so copies of the game from Japan, complete the translation from J-&gt;E, sell the physical book bundled with a physical copy of the translation to follow along. If you are in the board game scene, this is exactly how import board game stores do business: They charge some overhead and provide a service, the translation (so I might end up charging like $15 for a $10 book, and ONLY charging for "the book" while providing the translation "for free"). This neatly gets around all copyright claims while still providing the media to interested people.<br/>In fact, with Sword World I talked with the designer, and he said that this is likely the best method: Due to SW being an Old Property, the rights are in such a stranglehold with decrepit traditional literature/book publishers that it would be insane to jump through such hoops, so he even encouraged the above method - he didn't care more about either ("True English translation and release" VS "printout of translation bundled with book"), as long as it gets played, but noted that trying to negotiate the true translation (with an expected Profit of like Maybe $5k in one's lifetime?) would likely be a hellish maze of lava and murder.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'm really liking the concept of that "bundle with the original game book and sell the game book with the translation as a "Freebie" while at the same time bumping up the cost of product (like other importers, like yesasia.com etc)" method. It's legal, ethical, viable. It's just Ugly, and that's a concern I guess, one that even I have trouble swallowing.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322710/#Comment_322710" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-02T21:25:42+00:00" title="May  2, 2011  9:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2011 9:30AM by Andy.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and Matt Sanchez is currently translating a new project as well.
