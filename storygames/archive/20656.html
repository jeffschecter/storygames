But I've never felt that those categories do a great job of describing any particular individual experience, and I'd love to hear people expound on what gets them going.<br/><br/>I'll start:<br/><br/>I love the experience of being simultaneous creator and audience of a story. I value things created and honed in the moment. Don't bring me your prewritten ideas. Listen to me and build on what I say, take my idea and expand it.<br/><br/>I want to be immersed in the story we make together, but as audience, not character. Character immersion is a less interesting way to experience narrative for me.<br/><br/>I love a game that structures and limits this process. I want a game to notice what's happening in the story and make strong but low-profile intrusions into it. Pbta moves do this in a way that greatly pleases me. Fiction-in, fiction-out, with the dip into mechanics as seamless as possible.<br/><br/>I want concrete mechanical choices that have an unavoidable impact on the story. If I read a story in which a character is introduced as being smart and sexy, I want those things to matter to the story. I hate having things on my character sheet that never come up in play.<br/><br/>I love to be surprised about my character. I want other players to tell me things about my character, and then to grapple with what that means. If you tell me my genius scoundrel has forgotten his tools, I wouldn't say, "he would have made sure he had them!" I'd say, "wow, I wonder what circumstances made it so!"<br/><br/>I want reincorporation to an absurd degree. If we learn our belonging have been pilfered, it better be by that thief that was mentioned a few scenes back! I want the story to be in constant dialogue with our expectations.<br/><br/>I hate having to ask permission to do something, either from the game or from the GM. If I say, "I whip out my sonic screwdriver and fry their security system!" I don't want to have to roll dice simply to see whether such an act<br/>Is allowed. I want the game, players and GM to interact with my stated intention, like, "ah, but you also fry the navigation systems!" Or, "as you reach for it, you realize someone's snuck up behind you!" Having this interaction mediated by the game is usually better than having another player as arbiter. <br/><br/>The way in which the game structures story should be suggestive, not prescriptive.<br/><br/>So that's me! What about you?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453574/#Comment_453574" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-26T23:20:26+00:00" title="May 26, 2016 11:20PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, but we now know that you have a secret agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453575/#Comment_453575" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-26T23:34:55+00:00" title="May 26, 2016 11:34PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Secret no longer!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453576/#Comment_453576" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-27T01:01:15+00:00" title="May 27, 2016  1:01AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2016 7:27AM by Rickard.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to take part of forming a story together with a group.

This is why Forgite theory generally focuses on analyzing the agenda evident in instances of play, rather than trying to build a gaming horoscope for a specific individual. Your real gaming life is only beginning when you've perfected <i>one</i> set of complex interlocking preferences that work well together.<br/><br/>That being said, some of my favourite creative agendas over the last decade have been:<br/><b>*</b> <b>Dramatic advocacy with a relationship map scenario:</b> we create a fictional situation sizzling with unresolved tension between interesting characters. The situation is resolved via a cascade of conflicts and choices made by the central cast of characters. The players have an opportunity to play an advocacy role for the individual characters; presenting/playacting them for the benefit of the rest of the group, and deciding what the character does in difficult situations.<br/><b>*</b> <b>Dramatic advocacy with organic growth story:</b> we amass a bunch of evocative color in the form of setting, characters, more characters, monsters, sexy dramatic conceits, whatever. Player characters are created, rooted in the fictive setting in various socio-economic ways. Interesting events occur as orchestrated by a GM or something. Characters prove themselves by the choices they make, growing into defined dramatic personalities while making their mark in the world.<br/><b>*</b> <b>Narration-creation with a story framework:</b> the game has a rough dramatic arc or a story paradigm that gets filled with detail and meaning by the GM and the players. Because the abstract shape of the story pre-exists, we may focus on visceral realization of dramatic characters and atmospheric storytelling. The payoff occurs as the story "clicks together" and a theme is realized where before there was only a soulless formalism of structure.<br/><b>*</b> <b>Challengeful adventure with emergent conflict resolution:</b> strategic player resources in the form of player character pawns or whatnot are established in a living setting, and set upon a complex matrix of opportunities to tackle various challenges, "adventures". The strategic and tactical choices of the players turn into outcomes, victories and losses via a value-neutral process of world simulation, adjudicated by a neutral referee.<br/><b>*</b> <b>Challengeful conspiracy scenario with player-vs-player play:</b> player characters are sharks in the muddy waters of the setting, each with their own, contradictory goals. They have a wide variety of tools and resources, the value of which is unknown in advance - anything ranging from personal bloodthirst to friends in the algae farming community. Players compete and cooperate with each other and NPCs played by a neutral referee in an attempt to find success for their own character at his own terms.<br/><b>*</b> <b>Atmospheric adventure with railroad plot:</b> the GM has a story, and we'll get to enjoy it from a first-person perspective. Don't get too stuck on your character, he's ultimately a vessel for your viewpoint, rather than your own uniquely crafted work of art. As players we get to choose where the camera goes - controlling pace and focus - while the GM brings the content. When the GM's story actually <i>has</i> literary merit, we'll all enjoy ourselves.<br/><b>*</b> <b>Princess play adventure:</b> The player characters are fun, cool, personalized and quirky to play. The game has topic-appropriate activities for them to engage in, e.g. fighting. The GM (assuming there's one) facilitates. The payoff for the players is getting to playact their own cool character, seeing the planned individual in practical action in terms of dialogue, various acted events and whatnot.<br/><br/>(Those are not supposed to be accomplished all at once; rather, I would be surprised if you could combine any two of them into one game, instead of focusing all your effort into each one in turn. I left out explicit GNS terminology to protect the innocent.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453578/#Comment_453578" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-27T05:00:36+00:00" title="May 27, 2016  5:00AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a second I honestly thought that this was an old thread of mine that had been resurrected and that I had just forgotten about it. That (OP's) agenda sounds eerily like my own, described much as I would have.<br/><br/>I wrote a document once, called my "Mushin Manifesto" (NOT "Munchkin Manifesto"). It's in Swedish (I'll find a link if anyone's interested), but the big points were:<br/><br/>1. In Mushin there's no plan, there is only the here and now.<br/>2. In Mushin there is nothing outside the combat (i.e. the conversation).<br/>3. Mushin is honest and open.<br/>4. In Mushin, force is never countered with force.<br/>5. In Mushin there is no winning or losing.<br/>6. In Mushin, there is no opponent.<br/>7. Mushin is complete attention and engagement in the activity.<br/><br/>I also quoted some Japanese swordmaster:\n<blockquote>The mind must always be in the state of 'flowing,' for when it stops anywhere that means the flow is interrupted and it is this interruption that is injurious to the well-being of the mind. In the case of the swordsman, it means death. When the swordsman stands against his opponent, he is not to think of the opponent, nor of himself, nor of his enemy's sword movements. He just stands there with his sword which, forgetful of all technique, is ready only to follow the dictates of the subconscious. The man has effaced himself as the wielder of the sword. When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in the hand of the man's subconscious that strikes.</blockquote>\nThat's my agenda.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Well, it's an idealization of one of the functional agendas that I enjoy. It's an unachievable ideal, and there are other ways of playing that are also fun. There are also other ways of playing that are functional and enjoyed by others, but which are not my cup of tea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453580/#Comment_453580" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-27T06:28:33+00:00" title="May 27, 2016  6:28AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mushin is a word I'm way more familiar with than munchkin <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/>Have played way many more mushin no shin cards than munchkin cards.<br/><br/>So what are my own kicks?

I also had a few bad experiences with it, so it became some kind of mash I could define as "I want tactics witout a system". I enjoyed that one for a long time, though there came a time when I had to GM a lot of it.<br/><br/>Then my agenda changed for a GM one, where I wanted to show the players through a good story and ended up railroading and using illusionism a lot. My players still remember those days fondly, though at the end I burned out and totally changed my GM agenda.<br/><br/>I started looking for GMless stuff, though at some point I felt that I couldn't get the same quality content from that and full impro, so I went back to just playing for a while.<br/><br/>I was still tense, we played some PF but I couldn't shake myself from the feeling that I had to master the system to play it properly, even when our DM was GMing in a relaxed way. I regretted I wouldn't be able to GM nor even play 3.5 or 4ed D&amp;D nor PF while enjoying the game. Until 5e came out. It felt so easy and relaxed nowadays I'm DM it and doing half prep-half impro with a lot of player input<br/><br/>So right now I'm enjoying creating stuff together with the group, playing to find out what's the story about and where it goes. I experiment the mistery of the exploration and surprise of discovery along with the players, as well as the suspense. I'd like to integrate some drama and even romance, but my players don't so I just play along and enjoy what I get, as I've learned is more fun to not push anything into the game, but instead let things flourish out, watch them grow and build upon them to make them more solid and exciting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
