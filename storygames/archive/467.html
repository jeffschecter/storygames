                    Just by way of passing along information, I was reading on another forum about  <a href="http://yaraya.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">this guy</a> who has a cafe in Portland, and his interest in getting some gamers to come out and take over his place once a month.  Here's his idea:
<blockquote><br/>I've got a cafe. I really want to host roleplaying games, perhaps one night a           month. I used to play Rifts, but that was years ago... any suggestions on who to contact, how this might play out, the whole RPGer scene? <br/><br/>I think this would take place on a thursday night. We would, in a sense, theme out the place - complete with my staff and I dressed up. I'd like multiple games taking place at a time, each run by a GM, and have it be kind of a social scene. Like, if everyone played GURPS then the players could intermingle and intergame. I would imagine this would take some pretty good GMs, and that each GM (and storyline) would be assigned to a table. I've got space for probably 7 or 8 games to go on at a time.<br/><br/>I used to roleplay in living room. This could be alot of fun. <br/></blockquote>
To be clear, I myself am <em>not</em> in Portland, but I thought I'd pass it along for those of you who are, since it seems like this could be an interesting challenge and a good venue.  It doesn't sound like he really knows what he wants, but my guess is that a group of indie gamers would be better for his business than a bunch of Warhammer fanatics...                </div>

                            I live in Portland.  Sounds interesting, assuming it does turn out to be an indie game gathering and not "something else".<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see anything on his blog regarding this, other than some photos of the cafe. Can you provide a link to the original post?                        </div>

                            Sure.  Here's the <a href="http://monkeyfilter.com/link.php/11537" rel="nofollow">original thread</a>.  I didn't point to it originally because the commentary is from non-gamers who paint a pretty bleak picture of what this could be like.   However, I figure some interested indie gamers could convince him that this idea could be a lot better than he's imagining.<br/><br/>I considered responding directly to him and mentioning this forum or the Forge, but I thought I should check here first and see if there was any interest.                        </div>

                            There are a few Portlanders here (this seems like another good time to plug the <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/PortlandIndependentRPG" rel="nofollow">Portland Independent RPG Yahoo group</a>. This cafe might be interesting, though for the forseeable future, Thursday night doesn't work for me. I'd love to see a game club type of atmosphere, though I've never really liked trying to game in the same room as several other games.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            Reading the original thread, it looks like he's hoping to fill a lot of tables. Still, a couple of tables of people playing indie games and paying for their drinks beats a roomful of people playing Warhammer and asking for bottomless drinks.  Again, schedule permitting I'd go for this.<br/>
<br/>
(ffilz - I didn't know about the Yahoo group.  Good to know. When my schedule settles down I'll look into it.)                        </div>

                            Every November (for the past almost ten years or so) there's been an <a href="http://www.amberconnw.org/" rel="nofollow">Ambercon</a> in Troutdale, OR, not too far from Portland.  I recommend it strongly (and there are people who branch out into other games, although Amber DRPG is the primary focus.)                        </div>
