I've seen a lot of people saying that the Forge is broken for this these days, and I don't think that's true at all. It's a pretty active place. But it's very different from Story Games, and if you take the posting attitude and method from Story Games over to the Forge, it's going to go over like a lead balloon.<br/><br/>You can argue that this is a good thing or a bad thing <i>in some other thread please</i>. My point is: it's a thing, here's what you can do.<br/><br/>Props to David Donnachie for being a good sport and letting me use his posting history on the Forge as an example here. I wanted to use David's posts because:<br/>1) He's been one of the people having trouble getting through at the Forge.<br/>2) His posting history is very short, so it's easy to read through.<br/>3) There's both a good example and a bad example.<br/><br/>So here's every thread David ever started on the Forge, with the exception of one connections post looking for artists, in chronological order:<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21657" rel="nofollow">Some help needed with a combat mechanic</a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24991" rel="nofollow">[Solipsist] Pike Bros. Records</a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25468" rel="nofollow">[Solipsist] Looking for input</a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25710" rel="nofollow">[Solipsist] Superman and John Constantine get on a plane</a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25734" rel="nofollow">[Solipsist] Mermaid Towers</a><br/><br/>Okay, here's what you should do when posting to the Forge:<br/>Have a clear topic in mind. "I want help with my dice mechanic."<br/>Outline your goals for the game. "I want the game to give the players a sense of desperation and fear that they'll run out of resources."<br/>Give the required background information, explaining how the particular bit of the game you're asking about leads into other particular bits of the game.<br/><br/>If you want people to criticize your work, you have to give a detailed report of exactly what the present state of the game is, what your goals for the game are, and how those two are failing to meet. Anything else simply renders criticism impossible.<br/><br/>In other words, something rather like David's first post (some help with a combat mechanic) which goes into detail about the system, how it works, what's going wrong, and what help he wants help with.<br/><br/>Now, let's look at some of the other posts and how they've gone wrong. I agree totally that David is not getting feedback in them, I want to take a look at what he could have done to get the feedback he (apparently) wanted.<br/><br/>Pike bros. records gives a very detailed account of play, and a very detailed account of what's going on mechanically in the game. What it lacks is any description of the game's goals, or the present state of the game in any way. Like, I know that he's having trouble because he has too few tears, but I have no idea what tears are, why they are important to the system, or how the system might be changed to generate more tears in an appropriate manner. There's no way at all I can offer any advice on the game unless I've already read the whole text and have the context to understand the game's goals.<br/><br/>If David had laid out the game's goals and more of the mechanics (like his first post, above) he would have probably gotten stronger feedback. I think a large part of this problem comes from posting the same post on multiple sites. The Forge just functions differently than Story Games (or Collective Endeavour) and you should structure your posts differently for the environment.<br/><br/>On the whole, this post reads like a playtesting diary -- it's clear that he has an idea of what his game needs, what went wrong, etc. and he's just posting it for posterity. This is a pretty common posting method on the Playtesting forum! (I do it a lot.) It's a totally fine thing to do, but it generates zero critical feedback, for the reasons outlined above. I remember reading the thread and going "well, clearly he knows what he's doing and so I don't need to post, and it's not like I understand the game enough to write a post anyway."<br/><br/>[Solipsist] Looking for Input is probably the least likely sort of post to generate feedback. There's no talking about what problems the game is having, what the goals are, the basics of the concept, or anything like that. Instead, it's just a bare link to a PDF file and a nebulous request for "feedback." I never click through on these (and I don't know of anyone who does) because 9/10 times when I do, and pour hours into figuring out the game and giving critical feedback, my feedback is brushed off as "not what I was looking for." You have to tell us what you're looking for, and give us the context and reasons to care, in order to get a response.<br/><br/>[Solipsist] Superman and John Constantine get on a plane is another totally blank slate. There's nothing about how the game works, what it's about, or anything like that, just a character sheet (an intruiging looking character sheet, but meaningless without context), and a bare reporting of the events of the game, without any sense of what the systematic terms mean, why we should care, or what feedback (if any) David wants from the post. On the whole, with the catchy title and everything, it looks more like a promo than a request for advice, which is fine (and pretty common) but don't expect feedback on your promotional posts!<br/><br/>I think I've covered what I want to say, so I'm going to leave Mermaid Towers alone for the moment.<br/><br/>Thanks for allowing me to do this, David! Solipsist looks like a really cool game, and I wish I could have been more involved in the development process. I hope this makes it clear why it was so difficult for me to do so.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>P.S. done w/ editing now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129233/#Comment_129233" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T12:23:22+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 12:23PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Ben, it's actually very interesting to me. You are totally right about the first AP, it was the first AP I had ever written and I had no idea what I was doing with it (a few more APs later I still have no idea, but at least they are shorter <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I guess I had this notion that people posted APs and got loads of comments, often comments with criticism or suggestions in them. I'd certainly seen plenty of posts that appeared to be like that. I suspect, though, that they tend to get responses because people know who posted them and, more importantly, the game they are playing. I could be wrong though.<br/><br/>The second AP, by the way, was written by Gregor Hutton, not me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Interestingly at the time the first thread was startingly un-useful to me, not because I didn't get feedback, but because I had no idea what conceptual foundation people were working from and their answers made no sense to me. I was asking "help me crunch some numbers" and they were asking "what is your game trying to do".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129249/#Comment_129249" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T12:41:14+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 12:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the basic secret with AP posts... keep the narrative so short as to be almost non-existent. It really, really almost never matters. What matters is what the players were doing, and how they responded. Keep your notes on the mechanics use, and on the player reactions, and then you'll get comments. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's really that simple. The narrative is something you're constructing after the fact, and really tells us very little or nothing about the play that can be analyzed. What the players were doing is what play is. Post   Actual   Play. Not narrative. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129254/#Comment_129254" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T12:53:17+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 12:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 1:10PM by Valamir.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben's right about asking specific questions, but he's also right in giving the big picture design goals as well...those go hand in hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I was asking "help me crunch some numbers" and they were asking "what is your game trying to do".</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis is actually exactly what Forge Feedback is like.
