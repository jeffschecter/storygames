This has come up in situations where photographers have changed the licensing status of their photos on Flickr, even though a Creative Commons declaration is not actually revocable.<br/><br/>There's no Creative Commons registry, so if the only evidence is a website that may disappear or be modified, this introduces a risk.<br/><br/>(Not that this would be a problem with Dungeon World, as the upstandingness of its copyright holders is without tarnish.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/albill" title="albill"><img alt="albill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/348/nL4YMQPY0H7JF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/albill">albill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406162/#Comment_406162" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T14:39:03+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  2:39PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you asked the author/publisher?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406166/#Comment_406166" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T15:03:51+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  3:03PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's still 100% creative commons and always will be. Even if we were replaced by our evil mirror images from another dimension they'd have a hard time erasing the proof that DW is creative commons, since there's a versioned history mirrored to other people (through git). There is one issue with the text in git that I keep meaning to fix, but can never seem to find the time. Other than that they're as identical as was possible in our editing process (which is to say there may be minor differences because keeping everything in sync was HARD at the end).<br/><br/>I kind of wish that the book did say "this text is creative commons," and the fact that it doesn't is mostly an oversight. I can see people being confused by that and assuming the art is too, but I don't know if it would be enough of a problem for us not to do it.<br/><br/>I'm curious what others do in this realm. I don't have a copy of a Doctorow book handy\u2014does he say in the print edition that it's creative commons?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406174/#Comment_406174" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T18:21:26+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  6:21PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The print version of Dark Heart doesn't have the CC logo either, but the PDF does (including a line that says it refers to the text and not the art or design elements).
