Someone mentioned Ina wicked age in relation to this and it reminded me of the fun i'd had with that game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone tried playing IaWA in a more "traditional" way, where each player takes on a single character, and follows them through a series of adventures? How would this modify the "we owe" list and character advancement? Would you still use the Oracles, or do they basically become totally optional?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you hack the game to play a more "trad" like game with IaWA?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331866/#Comment_331866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T09:26:07+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  9:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, IAWA is made for long-term play. It just is. Playing it as a one-shot with only one chapter is pretty much a waste of time. I mean it's fun, but it's just a bidding system and a random monster, I mean situation, table.  The owe list is what makes this game shine and it only works with long term play. <br/><br/>The problem with sticking with the same set of characters is that the best interests that drive the game are best if the characters are working against each other, at cross purposes, or in some other way fighting each other. And if you're committed to the same set of characters, then nobody can murder each other or even really decisively achieve or not achieve what they need to. IAWA has a strong element of PvP, which is not a good match for the you-and-me-against-the-world traditional structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331878/#Comment_331878" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T09:42:59+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  9:42AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Playing it as a one-shot with only one chapter is pretty much a waste of time.</blockquote>\nSo wrong - some of my best one-shot experiences were IaWA. (Also, Fiasco is another bidding system and random situation table, and it's only for one-shots, and it's not a waste of time either.) But don't let me derail your thread. <br/><br/>Jason's right that there are probably more fitting games to hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331885/#Comment_331885" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T10:27:10+00:00" title="June 27, 2011 10:27AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I have done this with In A Wicked Age.
