Which people are looking for boothmates and booth organizing support?<br/>If you'd like to talk privately about this, we could start a whisper chain or take it to email (my last name at gmail).<br/>If you'd like to talk openly about this, that'd also be awesome.<br/><br/>If I could find booth buy-in for an affordable rate, and crash space somewhere reasonable, I might be in attendance.<br/><br/>ALSO:<br/><br/>1.) Are booths still the best way to sell? Or should I be looking at running lots of games and vending out of a backpack? Something else?<br/>2.) Other tips and suggestions? Is Gencon dead? Should I go elsewhere? Should I start my own convention in Indianapolis the week after? What?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356366/#Comment_356366" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T15:26:10+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  3:26PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Design Matters isn't happening this year (unless someone steps up).<br/><br/>IPR does a fine job of just selling your stuff, low risk to you.

Completely aside from the ethical reasons not to, GenCon takes that stuff pretty seriously (as they should) and if you're caught you'll get booted and banned.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend the GPA. A membership with them also gets you good access to Origins if that's something you're interested in (we're running Indie Games On Demand there, in case you hadn't heard!). Selling through IPR will cost you significant margin, BUT they'll handle everything and if the idea of your game in retail tickles your fancy, they're a decent way to go, as is Impressions, who act as a consolidator for the hobby game trade.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356444/#Comment_356444" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-28T02:16:49+00:00" title="January 28, 2012  2:16AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Clyde Rhoer was mentioning a stand.

If there's another booth option (Design Matters, etc.) that you prefer, by all means do that, but I still recommend coming over and running games instead of standing in a booth trying to hone your sales pitch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
