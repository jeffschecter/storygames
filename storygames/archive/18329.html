I've been talking with a friend of mine about the more obscure games. He popped into Forge Midwest for a session of Anima Prime, because he's poking around in the realms of the more obscure games. He said that, compared to a game like 3.5 D&amp;D, the characters all felt same-ish.<br/><br/>Now, irregardless of whether you agree, are there any lesser-known games which provide this high level of differentiation? Is it more-or-less unique to D&amp;D? (Mythender struck me as one such game, with the different Gifts you can pick up.) The only one I can currently think of is Old School Hack, which is an offshoot of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I think the big thing he's looking for is distinct class features that have unique mechanics. I'm thinking of suggesting the *World games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413273/#Comment_413273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T09:17:39+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  9:17AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of games have plenty of character differentiation.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel and friends is another good example.<br/><br/>Frank<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413276/#Comment_413276" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T10:06:11+00:00" title="May  1, 2013 10:06AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RIfts and other Palladium games have classes (that's what we call em.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413281/#Comment_413281" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T10:26:20+00:00" title="May  1, 2013 10:26AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do we want a complete list?

It's more differentiated than Burning Wheel, about the same as Apocalypse World. Slightly less than 3rd ed. D&amp;D, due to a more unified resolution system and a degree of voluntary choice in how deep into the rabbit-hole you go. (With 3rd ed. some of the differentiation is forced.) Still, the game's got scope for characters that play radically differently to each other, and unlike D&amp;D these differences can go into such fundamentals as what your character actually spends all their time on in the game.<br/><br/>FATE-based games like Spirit of the Century are also quite reasonable in this department - about as differentiated as Burning Wheel, not quite as much as AW or TSoY. Differs a lot between the individual games, and if you can consider fictional positioning to be differentiation (that is, you're looking at more than just mechanics), then something like SotC is massively differentiated, as the whole premise of the game is to have entirely lateral character concepts.<br/><br/>Of these four (AW, TSoY, BW and FATE) TSoY is most clearly mechanically differentiated, so if that's the sole gauge, then maybe check it out. The game has mechanical subsystems that individual characters commit to and that are completely unrelated to each other, which is pretty much what 3rd edition D&amp;D does, except that D&amp;D only gets this level of differentiation for casters vs. non-casters.<br/><br/>And yes, older games have plenty of character differentiation - I'd say it's more common for a game traditionally to be built on the basis of differentiation than similarity. Ars Magica, for example, manages massive differences between characters while sticking to "everybody plays a magic-user".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413344/#Comment_413344" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T02:08:03+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  2:08AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw, I forgot Ars Magica.

(Speaking very loosely)<br/><br/>So that gives you very distinct character possibilities without needing specific character classes.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413825/#Comment_413825" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-09T10:13:12+00:00" title="May  9, 2013 10:13AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.
