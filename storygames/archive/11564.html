More supplies can help their families more, but the weight of those supplies also slows them down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mortality</cite>Hmm, odd thought (inspired by Dread which I played recently), there's a 'card game' out there called<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35763/climb" rel="nofollow">Climb!</a>, which consists of a set of cards with colour bordered holes in. You set up a series of cards, then must use one hand to make your way from start to finish, only placing the appropriate finger (thumb for black, index for blue etc.) on the table showing through the holes. If one of the cards moves, you fall. Add some rules for difficulty increasing number of cards, and encumbrance meaning you can't use certain fingers or something, and you're set.<br/>Of course, there's the problem that unlike Jenga, there aren't really any cheap knock offs available. If you already had the game though (and I do), it might make for an interesting experiment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>Don't forget that it's near impossible to roll with supplies on your back, and throws your balance off, and...I've never been able to do parkour well while lugging extra weight, but it's just a game, so why let reality stop you?<br/><br/>But yeah, getting the sense of flow and rythm is a tough part of parkour. Merely carrying bonuses from one roll to the next doesn't do it justice. I'll have to go out and practice more and see if any inspiration comes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>Daniel, it sounds like Dead Weight could be that mythical dice-stacking game that people keep talking about, like backwards Jenga.  Keep stacking up supplies until your tower crashes and the zombies get you.</blockquote>\nPutting all this together, I'm imagining a kind of Jungle Speed/Dice stacking game where there's a punch bowl with tons of different dice. The "running" phase is a real-time, timed dexterity game. <br/><br/>When you're running, you can grab one die at a time, put it down on the table, then grab another die and put it down on the table or on a previously placed die. Eventually you have a row of stacks. That row of stacks shows how far into the city your runner got and how high they were at various intervals. Getting too low puts you in reach of the monsters at ground level, but if a tower falls, your runner falls, too.<br/><br/>For example [3] [1] [4] [2] is a row of four towers, the first is three dice tall, the second is one die tall, the third is four dice tall, the fourth is two dice tall. That means your runner got four blocks into the city. <br/><br/>I'm also imagining monsters being represented not by hit points or die rolls, but by the number of times someone gets to slam his hand down on the table to try to jostle people's towers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

With my luck all the white padding on the ground will melt and become mud by the time my health returns.<br/><br/>Blocks. That suggests streets between, and streets between blocks suggests some pretty big gaps to jump. Maybe Belle can manage 9 metres with a 1-storey drop, but that still doesn't get across a 4-lane road plus sidewalks. This game could benefit from some thought about architecture. Check out a few cities on Google street view. For example, many streets in Taipei have no sidewalks, making them narrower and potentially jumpable, but it also means Taipei doesn't really have a downtown like in Manhattan or Toronto or Tokyo, because it doesn't allocate space to pedestrians the same way. Speaking of Tokyo, walkway overpasses enable much more pedestrian maneuverability.<br/><br/>One pet peeve about jumping rules in other games, that may not apply given the extremely abstract approach you seem to be taking; please don't have big differences in distance between a bad roll and a good one. I can gauge my maximum jump distance within about 10 centimetres, and that's pretty imprecise compared to most traceurs I meet. It's also enough to cause a fall. That said, pure physical potential doesn't really determine the maximum distance of a particular jump. There's something mental in picking a landing point that controls your jump distance more than pure muscle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258315/#Comment_258315" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T19:47:59+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  7:47PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oooh, heh, it would actually be pretty interesting if you just tossed a pool of d6s on the table, letting them fall where they may. The results of each die representing the height of whatever bit of urban geography. A pawn would represent your runner, moving through this environment, trying to avoid being on the table for too long since that's the street-level, where the monster are.<br/><br/>Okay, that's more of a board game than a fast-moving feel that folks were describing above.

The real speed advantage of parkour is found at ground level and within 1 storey of that because there's more terrain that functions as obstacles to others, but may be crossed quickly by a traceur. The whole range of motions can be found there, too.<br/><br/>It's not so much about getting someplaceotherwise inaccesible (e.g. rooftops), but getting someplace faster than could normally be done by having the skill to find new paths. If characters spend their time in safety zones (rooftops), you're avoiding game tension, when racing at ground level could explore game tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
