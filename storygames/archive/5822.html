My first project is to get some scenarios for the game into the pipeline.<br/><br/>I'd love to publish some scenarios in the vein of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/doctorpeace/well.html" rel="nofollow">The Well of Souls</a> by Chris Chinn and Peter Nordstrand, or Ron's <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=11691.0" rel="nofollow">Final Days at Skull Point</a> (from the <a href="http://www.glorantha.com/products/1403.html" rel="nofollow">Gathering Thunder</a> scenario book for HeroQuest).<br/><br/>If you're interested, check out the proposal guidelines <a href="http://www.theknownworld.com/submissions.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>I'm happy to answer any questions I can here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
