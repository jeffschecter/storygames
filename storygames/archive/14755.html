If the game is "Write down your power" and the rule is "describe using it play, whatever it can do, it does" not interested.  1) I don't need to buy a game that tells that, if I want to play that game I can do it any time I want for free.  2) It no longer feels legitimate to me.  To me super powers are about acknowleding the laws of physics that apply to normal people and then breaking them.  Breaking them is what makes them super powers and not just cool stuff people can do.  But in order to achieve the sense of wonder of breaking the laws of physics you have to have a game framework that at least acknowledges the limitations of physics.  So I want to play a game where I definitively know that I can lift 11 tons and that if faced with a 13 ton object I'll need to find a lever or some help.  I don't want to play a game where I'm simply "super strong" and "yeah you can probably lift something like that", blech.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter creation has to be fun.  It needs to be flexible enough to allow creation of lots of crazy stuff and it needs to output results that are definable in their mechanical impact...but above all it needs to be fun.  Fun to me in this sense means creative musings and enjoying the possibilities of imagining the intersection of powers.  It does not mean spreadsheets.  Thing <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> I loathe about supers...Champions / Hero style character creation.  I've tried playing Champions...twice...both times we quit before character creation was finished...OMG.  I know there are some who swear by Hero as the Wunder Game...but if I were nominating a list of most painful games ever designed, that would get my nod for top 10.  V&amp;V; was fun to play but character creation was boring...too simple.  By far the most fun creating characters I've had in a supers game was Heroes Unlimited.  BY FAR.  Unfortunately HU is married to the God Awful travesty of all that's good and holy Palladium system so actual play...fun-ish but ultimately stupid.  I wanted to like Mutant's and Masterminds but that was at the height of my loathing of all things d20 and it couldn't overcome my willful Hate-on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the mechanics of the system to have fun tactical expressions.  I want the powers to not just do cool things in the fiction but do cool things with the dice.  Stuff like super speed giving me more dice to do cool stuff and super strength giving me bigger dice and ranged powers giving me one color die while touch powers are another color die and so on.  Some powers let me do rerolls and others let me set dice to maximum, and others let me try for a straight yahtzee style...whatever.  Those aren't real ideas just riffing on the idea that when my powers do stuff in the fiction I want to be physically doing stuff with the mechanics.  Stuff more nuanced and interesting then add +5 to damage for super strength.  Stuff like 4E powers or Magic Cards where you can hit upon different combinations of manipulating powers that lead to cool combos effects within the mechanics.  V&amp;V; had a little of this with the attack types vs defense types table.  Brave New World had some awesome stunt rules that allowed you to buy cool extra effects with great roles.  The Roll and Keep dice system has a little bit of this as you could manipulate different types and feels to success by which side of the equation you maximized.  Riddle of Steel has a good bit of this in how the various dueling moves impact the pool of dice you roll.  Dogs in the Vineyard has a good bit of this with the interaction of blocks and reverses and taking the blows and the inherent strategy in manipulating all the different dice type.  I want a supers game that takes stuff like that...maybe even completely different sub systems...and ties it all into powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was an independently published space combat game called Quad-S that came out a number of years ago.  Each race was a seperate book and each race played by a completely different set of rules.  Some rolled pools of dice, some rolled single dice, some rolled pairs.  Some ships had hit points, some had damage states (ala wound levels) some tracked individual system hits (ala car wars).  Some had shields that absorbed points of damage, some defenses made ships harder to hit, some forced successful attacks to be rerolled.  Some tracked power consumption.  Some could only do 1 or 2 things per turn from a limited list of actions, Some teleported around the board, some moved only in straight lines, some used vector style rocket movement...you get the idea.  Point is that there were only a few common points of contact between each race...the spaces on the map for counting range and movement distances, and the fact that there were hits and misses.  After that, one player would play the game by one set of ship rules and the other by another, and the crazy interactions of those rules with each other made for really interesting match ups.  That's what I want to see in a supers game.  Each type of super power does something mechanically that feels like that super power.  And then you just see how the tactical interplay of the mechanics matches up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335536/#Comment_335536" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T12:53:20+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 12:53PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, have you looked at One Roll Engine, specifically Wild Talents or Godlike?

We had a ton of fun with that.  We were kinda too young at the time when we tried to play it, so I'm sure we didn't do it right, and I haven't had a chance to play it more recently but a large part of the above is based on nostalgic memories of that game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the cleverness behind ORE.  I think the Reign version is more refined and functional than the Godlike version...as I recall some of the Hard and Soft dice tricks (I forget exactly what Godlike called them) were statistically questionable i.e. potentially broken.  Wild Talents has been on my list of things to check out some day, but I haven't yet...anything in particular you recommend about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnima Prime has me intrigued (much of anime is essentially super heros with a non western twist on drama) as does Mystic Empyrean which is kind of like Everway-Supers from the description.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHU was driven by power packages.  As I recall there were Major and Minor packages.  The major packages pretty much listed off a bunch of powers related to a central theme (like Elemental Control: Water).  So with one package you got all of the obvious stuff you should have if you had elemental mastery over water.  Minor Packages were more like single powers or stunts for powers.  So you could have Elemental Control: Water, and also...Telepathy.  I forget how you determined how many Major and how many Minor packages you got but by mixing and matching you could do alot of stuff.  So it was mostly about flipping through the powers, pausing to imagine what Elemental Control: Water + Telepathy would look like, then deciding to move on and try out something else.  (It also had an abbreviated version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' animal forms powers so you could create Rhino Man or Shark Boy etc.)  Since each power was stated up old school style (xcubic feet of this material moving at y speed does zd6 damage type stuff) it all had mechanical impact and since the framework was so basic it was easy to hack to create variants and the like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chill%20K" title="Chill K"><img alt="Chill K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chill%20K">Chill K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335544/#Comment_335544" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T13:47:52+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  1:47PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2011 1:48PM by Chill K.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever I look into a supers game, I always look for at least one of these three things.<br>\n<br>\n1.

AP gives a lot of freedom to narrate, and assumes a lot of competence on behalf of the characters.  I think the concept of "acknowledging the laws of physics and then breaking them" is one of the greatest super hero concept phrases i've ever heard in my life ever.  It sums up exactly what i'm looking for.  When Batman outsmarts Darkseid i want it to be because he's goddamn smart.

But it wasn't the holy grail.<br/>I want to see that kind of design explored a lot, lot more.  I want to tell a GM what my way cool, super specific, when-it-can-be-used-and-when-it-can't powerset is.  And i want it to feel like that powerset, not just a 'special effect' for buying 'teleport and extra action' as a power.  I want the system to back me up.  Not hand wave things.<br/><br/>I remember reading Truth and Justice.  Somehow i started with the amazing, brilliant, epic-awesome list of powers.  Then i read how you build a character and play the game.  It was jarring to read so much about powers in such an inspiring way, and then find out they really don't do anything for the game or it's play.  I like T&amp;J, but it, too, fails my 'powers are rules' guideline.<br/><br/>Sadly enough, i can also admit:  the very best Supers games i've played by far?  Palladium and M&amp;M.  Go figure.<br/><br/>I'm going to write a top ten.  i don't want to help further gank this thread.  Just...needed to put my words out there.  Geez it's good to hear other people rant on this stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335579/#Comment_335579" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T18:29:38+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  6:29PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2011 6:32PM by Nathan_H.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think superhero is a genre anymore; it's just costuming, props and special effects.<br/>First off, I think you'd have to narrow down the approach.  <br/>Superhero books from the 40's thru to the 90's are different then they are now.  <br/>Team books are different then solo books, and having a different creative team influences the books.<br/>I don't think it's possible to have one game that emulates all the various takes there've been.<br/>There's a big difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_%28comics%29" rel="nofollow">Concrete</a> and Grant Morrison's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Patrol#The_relaunch_.28vol._2.29" rel="nofollow">Doom Patrol</a>.<br/><br/>I think a game that is build specifically for cliffhanger endings would be a nice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335600/#Comment_335600" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T22:41:06+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 10:41PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking about maybe the powers somehow having hooks into the way the game world's environment ("physics", maybe) works.  By this I mean something like DC Heroes' AP system, where everything that could be measured fell somewhere on the logarithmic scale.  So, for instance, a character with 7 AP's of movement could move whatever distance 7 AP's was in whatever amount of time 1 AP of time represented.  To figure out how far the character would move, just add to both sides; 8 AP's of distance in 2 AP's of time, 9 of distance in 3 of time, and so forth.  <br/><br/>This could be combined with a freeform power description system not unlike Marvel Superheroes.  (Side note: when I first started playing MSH, I dutifully rolled up my first... 2 or 3, maybe? ... characters by the book, and wrote down the names of the powers and their ranks.  That lasted until I got the first supplement, and realized that (a) the Marvel Universe is large, and contains multitudes, and (b) the people who wrote the game didn't do that!  I had a whole helluva lot more fun once I started writing up my own powers. I'd usually set them in the Excellent to Remarkable range, out of some sort of idea that I shouldn't go overboard with this.)  You could do things like "Carries a big sword of Incredible material strength and damage, which he uses with Remarkable skill."  Or "Fluidic Manipulation: He has the power to manipulate the fluids inside every living creature's body. He can do this at Good range, causing up to Excellent damage each round. A Red result with this power is treated as a Kill."  <br/><br/>(Incidentally, every random power roll chart in any system, anywhere, becomes a Marvel Superheroes resource, just by replacing whatever game mechanics in the other system with MSH ranks.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335601/#Comment_335601" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T22:51:52+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 10:51PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>This is very true, though I think it extends into any over-the-top action fiction, like sword &amp; sorcery, spaghetti western, and pulp WWII.<br/>...so, potentially, the Danger Meter from DangerPatrol should serve as a base for all superhero combat.</blockquote>\nOne thing that possibly separates superhero comics from those other things is that most comics come back to the idea that the hero's flaws are the real obstacle to victory, not the hero's opponents.<br/><br/>If your nemesis beats you down, kidnaps your loved ones, holds the entire city hostage, wrecks your credit rating...you just get that much better at winning the day.

Nathan H is dead on when he says Team vs. Solo is two veins.  Another vein would be Occult vs. Hero (like Hellboy or Doctor Strange vs. X-Men or Superman).  Another would be Street Level vs. Global vs. Galactic (Green Arrow vs. Superman vs. Green Lantern).  Another would be Time, just like Nathan says, too, are we doing this as a retro gig?  Or are we going to try to even pay attention to the fact that every 'hero' was a murderer in the 90s and ever villain was a joke in the 60s?  Even 'personal problems vs. super problems' is another vein to tap.  Spidey has got it bad in real life, but generally speaking Supes is always going to have great parents, a wonderful girlfriend, and good friends at his awesome job.<br/><br/>I think you have to make individual games based on what vein your going to follow, what level you're going to play on, and what flavor of magic-vs-science you're interested in.  What would be cool...is if you could make one basic system feel...maybe create a few volumes?  Pitch the feel of the game based on which character is the lead?<br/><br/>If you watch the Justice League cartoons (which is the closest thing ever to a real continuity and a wonderful blend of all the veins mentioned above) the 'feel' of the episode depends on a spotlight character.  And yet, as you watch that show you can still go back and watch Superman fight Mongol on an alien world, or go back farther and watch Batman deal with a viable threat of Joker gassing a few people on the street.  It's all one continuity, but the focus of the episode (and to a larger extent the focus of the *series*) is what determines the flavor of your powerlevel, occult element, and universal scale...<br/><br/>This is best thread ever, btw...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335793/#Comment_335793" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T11:06:37+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 11:06AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2011 11:07AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>At least Peter Parker does, which in my opinion is the only example that matters.

His perpetual underemployment, Aunt May's sickness, problems with his love life -- those are EXTERNAL problems, as far as I'm concerned.  They are things that the universe has done to him, part of "that ol' Parker luck."  They are not his fault -- there is nothing that Peter Parker is doing to make those things happen to himself, there is no horrible character flaw within him that is bringing those woes to his doorstep.  He soldiers on like a champ in the face of these challenges and does the best he can.  Hell, in most cases those problems actually drive him to greater heroics, which is exactly what the reverse-death-spiral is all about.<br/><br/>It's when he doubts that he's cut out for being a superhero that he starts having real trouble, or when he forgets that he owes it to his uncle to keep holding up this great responsibility that he has trouble.  When he falls into one of those traps, it weakens him and he'll just keep losing until he gets past it.  And yes, these are very much in the minority of Spider-Man stories, but that's because for the most part we like comics where the hero wins; stories where the hero's faults overcome him <i>should</i> be the minority.<br/><br/><br/>It's probably more clear-cut to think of it in terms of Iron Man, to be honest, since Tony Stark is possibly one of the most self-destructive heroes in the whole Marvel universe (well, he's up there with Henry Pym, anyway).  What can bring down Iron Man for good?  Not a villain, not the government, not the stock exchange...but him, alone at 2am with a bottle of scotch.  That's what's going to wreck his life and make him lose more and more as the story goes on, and that's what he'll have to overcome if he wants to win again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jkubli" title="jkubli"><img alt="jkubli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jkubli">jkubli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335794/#Comment_335794" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T11:13:44+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 11:13AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2011 11:14AM by jkubli.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi there. I hope I don't look like a worthless shill, as this is my first post; but I was lurking, and when I saw this thread, I thought I'd respond.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to check out my game, Invulnerable RPG. It's on DriveThru, IPR, and Lulu. One of the major design goals was to make it easy to design a hero's powers without breaking out an accounting pad or a calculator. Action Points, called Determination, double as a kind of stress/sanity meter, so even a major-league hero can be too disheartened/dispirited to fight their best, a (rather grimdark) plot point in the setting. Heroes regenerate Determination by serving their Motivations; each hero has 2 Motivations, which may conflict, and will almost definitely conflict in some situation with another hero's Motivations. And I wanted the rules to adequately cover a variety of heroic sub-genres, which I think it does fairly well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've got a 23-page preview up on Scribd. http://www.scribd.com/doc/32734853/Invulnerable-Tabletop-Super-Hero-Roleplaying-Game-Year-One-Edition-Preview If anyone is interested in doing a review of the game, let me know and I'll shoot you a copy of the PDF. Again, if this looks like scumsucking spamvertising, let me know, and I'll go away, but I agree with almost everything in this thread so far!

Which gets you nicely into the ballpark of metaphor!<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel<br><br>*Nathan, the fact that a genre is evolving does not make it "not a genre."<br>**Not sorry, actually.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335841/#Comment_335841" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-24T03:55:28+00:00" title="July 24, 2011  3:55AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jkubli</cite>Hi there. I hope I don't look like a worthless shill, as this is my first post; but I was lurking, and when I saw this thread, I thought I'd respond.<br><br>You might want to check out my game, Invulnerable RPG. It's on DriveThru, IPR, and Lulu. One of the major design goals was to make it easy to design a hero's powers without breaking out an accounting pad or a calculator. Action Points, called Determination, double as a kind of stress/sanity meter, so even a major-league hero can be too disheartened/dispirited to fight their best, a (rather grimdark) plot point in the setting. Heroes regenerate Determination by serving their Motivations; each hero has 2 Motivations, which may conflict, and will almost definitely conflict in some situation with another hero's Motivations. And I wanted the rules to adequately cover a variety of heroic sub-genres, which I think it does fairly well.<br><br/>I've got a 23-page preview up on Scribd. <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/32734853/Invulnerable-Tabletop-Super-Hero-Roleplaying-Game-Year-One-Edition-Preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scribd.com/doc/32734853/Invulnerable-Tabletop-Super-Hero-Roleplaying-Game-Year-One-Edition-Preview</a> If anyone is interested in doing a review of the game, let me know and I'll shoot you a copy of the PDF. Again, if this looks like scumsucking spamvertising, let me know, and I'll go away, but I agree with almost everything in this thread so far!

The rules need to let me play the character I want to play, i.e. no Sorcerers or Battlesuit Pilots in Aberrant.<br/>\n(2). Don't send me or my friends into math epilepsy while making our heroes.<br/>\n(3). Don't punish me for making a versatile character vs. a specialized character. Yes, making me do more math definitely counts as punishment.<br/>\n(4). Give me a neat setting with lots of game hooks, but one that doesn't get in my way. A DC fan, Marvel fan, etc. should feel at home.<br/>\n(5). Don't have lots of rules I don't need, or that make me waste time on inconsequential stuff. Can we please gloss over or deal quickly with all the mundane garbage my hero might own?<br/>\n(6). I like that DND 4E makes it hard to make a character that sucks (one of the few things I do like). Let's do that here, too. If my hero sucks in some way, make it clear to me that that's my choice.<br/>\n(7). The rules need to be reasonably balanced, with no blatant exploits. If an option is a no-brainer, build it in, don't charge for it.<br/>\n(8). Combat needs to be tactical and interesting. Give the players cool stuff, in the rules, that they can do; don't rely entirely on description.<br/>\n(9). Give me a system that encourages roleplaying and portrays the hero's inner struggle, and moral debates with other heroes. A traditional "alignment system" is a little too simplistic for a real debate of this kind.<br/>\n(10). Give me some ready-made bad guys (and rogue heroes, and government agents) to pull out for when the heroes zig when I thought they'd zag. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, Invulnerable meets these criteria pretty well. You're always going to hit snags and find errata, but they're getting pretty few now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
