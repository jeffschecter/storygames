Unsurprisingly, the game is not good. But my hope is that there might be some things that could become good about it.<br/><br/>But while I can tell you quite a bit of what sucks, and have some vague enthusiasms for certain other bits, I have no idea of how to fix it. I'm not sure what the revision deadline is for the anthology, but I haven't had much of a chance until this week to actually sit down and try to work on it, and I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do. So I'm reaching out for suggestions and thoughts! I appreciate anyone who wants to read and tell me what they think.<br/><br/>Elevator Pitch: the game is a kind of hack of The Quiet Year (maybe my current favorite game), where people-watching stands in for map-making. Also more generic, with different playsets. More conventionally collaborative, and with a weird kind of larpy, social experiment-y, pretentious and probably preachy endgame. It can be read on the Golden Cobra site, the direct link is here: <a href="http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/Gabardine.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/Gabardine.pdf</a><br/><br/>I have some of my own ideas about what's wrong with the game and what might be worth salvaging, but first I want to look at the criticism I received from the eminent judges of the contest, which overlaps to some extent with my own. The judges were, on the whole, kind and encouraging, with some nice things to say about the work (and thanks to all of them for reading and running the contest!).<br/><br/>But they did have some specific critiques. First, that the premise is not hooky enough for gamers (with a nod toward the idea of the necessary zombie). This is the only criticism I don't really find compelling. Every imaginative person I've ever known has played some variant of the people-watching game from time to time. And the playsets include monsters and spies and such if you really need a genre hook. So this one is a bit of a red herring to me.<br/><br/>Second, the premise of the game (being asshole people-watchers who make up stories about others instead of talking to them) being at odds with the aim (as expressed through the heart challenges and the admonition to play with love and mercy). This is totally fair and one of my own big concerns about the game. <br/><br/>Tie that concern to another judge's criticism that the game is overwrought. Which is also totally true. Much of my writing is overwrought, because I as a person am somewhat overwrought. It's possible that alleviating (tho not quite fixing) these two things might require the same solution, namely, rewriting the rules in a more neutral tone. I'd lose a couple sentences I kind of like, but one must be unafraid of killing one's darlings.<br/><br/>The last significant crit from the judges is that the Heart challenges co-opt strangers in potentially uncomfortable and unfair ways. I feel very uneasy about this myself. I feel like the Heart challenges are important because the game is intended to be about the shift from curiosity to exploration and kindness and expression, but there are some Heart challenges as written that are potentially unpleasant. <br/><br/>Besides these judges' criticisms, I'll note that the game is extremely unfocused. I offer too many options for gameplay (including an entire alternate rules-set, and suggestions for copping out of the most delicate parts of the game). All of the playsets are undercooked and require significant additional thought and playtesting to be effective. The text is not always clear enough (at least one reader didn't realize that the game involved watching actual people not just making up imaginary people whole-cloth). The game requires a very specific set of circumstances to be played entirely, and there might be too much business (the cards and the playsets) to be played effectively in those circumstances. There might not be enough game there to bother, too. Does the game really add anything you couldn't get by just walking around and people-watching with a close friend or two?<br/><br/>And I'm sure there are plenty of other valid criticisms I'm missing. Please feel free to let me know if you have any others!<br/><br/>So what can I do to make the game better? I thought about just shelving it and not sharing it post-contest, as I'm unlikely to get it to a place where people will actually want to play it. But I'm trying to see culture less as pure self-expression and more as a conversation, and I want to be part of the conversation. My great hope is that some of my own mediocre ideas in here might accidentally inspire some brilliant ideas from someone else who stumbles upon it along the way. So what ideas are worth sharing from this, and how to present them in the most useful way? This is my question.<br/><br/>Three preliminary ideas: <br/><br/>Tighten the focus. Bring it down to one playset that captures the thematic heart of what I'm trying to do. The two bonus playsets are just dumb silliness to use the GC ingredients, but they also point to making a much more focused kind of playset with a narrower story addressing more focused themes, which might be the way to go. If I can point to some potential conflicts and relationships with leading questions that address and reinforce in-fiction the main thematic concerns of the game (curiosity, voyuerism, judgement, reaching out and kindness), then I might leave a stronger overall impression. <br/><br/>Alternatively, open it up. Lose the playsets entirely, make the Gabardine Light the actual Gabardine, but focus on suggesting different techniques and formats for asking and answering questions. Leave all the fictional content to the players. The game potentially becomes more playable, but I also add less to an activity many people already do, and lose any potential thematic or in-fiction elements. The Heart challenges become less powerful, maybe even become vestigial.<br/><br/>Or just clean up the formatting, re-write in a more neutral tone, and leave it basically as the flawed monstrosity it is.<br/><br/>Or something else entirely. Any ideas or thoughts will be greatly appreciated! My plan is to give the game this week, and whatever I have by Sunday is it; on to more bountiful game design pastures, hopefully. Thanks for reading, at the very least.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440469/#Comment_440469" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-25T13:14:07+00:00" title="November 25, 2014  1:14PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like Gabardine!<br/><br/>There's a time honored tradition of unceremoniously dumping contest constraints post-contest, so that's always an option. But my impulse would be to follow your second suggestion, personally. Lighten it up, take a hard look at heart challenges (which as written make me a little uncomfortable, since they co-opt people without consent) and trust your players to pattern match their own fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440522/#Comment_440522" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-26T22:04:16+00:00" title="November 26, 2014 10:04PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks (again), Jason!

Give your text a heart by putting yourself into the text. You still have to be ready to kill your darlings when the proofreaders change the text.<br/><br/>That's that about that.

Page 28 are just excuses you make up to make people not to play the game.<br/><br/>The acknowledgment doesn't help you a bit. Either I haven't heard of the game(s), which makes the information worthless, or it will give me a certain thinking pattern ("It's like MicroScope") when reading your game. You want a blank canvas to fill, instead of having to break an established pattern. If you really want to have acknowledgment, put it at the very end of the game.<br/><br/>The game example explains the use of the rules better than the rules. So I would had used that text to form a structure of play where rules are introduced as the example continues. That would had made the game text more efficient.<br/><br/>There are a lot you can do with the layout to enhance the understanding of the game but I wont go into that.<br/><br/>The game was a little bit edgier than I thought, because you should play this game out in public and use people around you to draw inspiration from but also involve them in heart challenges. It adds to the asshole-ry aspect of the game by using humans for your own pleasure. If this is purely an experimental game then go for it, but I think very few people would feel comfortable enough to want to play this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440758/#Comment_440758" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-09T09:11:50+00:00" title="December  9, 2014  9:11AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2014 4:29AM by amphigorist.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Rickard! Thanks for the thorough and thoughtful feedback. It means a lot to me. I've enjoyed watching you develop Imagine, and enjoyed reading the submitted version as well. <br/><br/>Feedback this detailed is better than I deserve, especially considering I've been so lazy I haven't worked on my proposed revision at all. (In fairness, it was about 20% busy-ness, but still like 80% laziness.) Here are some quick late-night, insomniac thoughts in response; I'll try to dig into it a bit more tomorrow.<br/><br/>re: Mean Girls re-skin. That would be an interesting (and probably more fun) game, but probably too mean-spirited for what I was trying to accomplish here.<br/><br/>I think you are right about the example text and the layout. I wrote this game on a cheap android tablet while on a cross-country road trip; even the minimal document layout I did was a major pain on the tablet. It could certainly be vastly improved. <br/><br/>I also agree with you and Jason (and others) who think that the Heart challenges don't work, but I'd like to offer a half-hearted defense of them.  So the game comes straight from me thinking about the constraints of the Golden Cobra contest, specifically the playing in public spaces constraint. And for some reason, I thought about this scene from the movie Wonder Boys: <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-UmDELbsNg6w?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmDELbsNg6w"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/UmDELbsNg6w/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>That scene is about some dudes being assholes in a way that seems pretty familiar to me. Considering my own experiences and the number of pop culture examples I could think of (including movies like Her and The Shop Around the Corner and songs like America), I believe that watching people and making up stories about them is a fairly common, nearly-universal experience. But it is always kind of a dick move. No matter how complexly and generously we imagine others, the truth is always stranger, deeper, irreducible. So I want to make sure my game acknowledges that.<br/><br/>But it also needs to acknowledge that the people-watching game is not pure assholery. It's born, quietly, from curiosity, from a nascent empathetic impulse, and from a subtle desire for connection. <br/><br/>So here's how I envisioned it working: the game gives you permission to look at these people and make up fiction about them. And then the heart challenges are intended to break the game as a game- to make you realize that you've been unfair about this, but it's okay because the reason you did it is that on some level you care who this person is and you're willing to turn this fake connection and interaction into a real one. <br/><br/>Because while you have this in-game social objective: to get a response, or to learn something about a person, or to be seen and imagined in a skewed way by someone else, you (read: I) can't do those things just as a game. If I talk to someone with the goal of finding a way they aren't like a werewolf, it's not gonna take much beyond "Hi" before I (and most non-sociopaths) am actually interacting with them as a real, whole person. Maybe I like them, maybe I don't, maybe they don't like me- but the interaction is going to be genuine and personal, no matter my motivation for starting it. Similarly if I give a impromptu performance where I tell my friend where the codes are hidden in the earshot of others, I'm gonna be very aware of people's responses to me, to what they must be thinking of me. It reminds me that the relationship is symmetrical- they don't really know anything about me (maybe that I'm capable of silliness), and I don't really know anything about them.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the idea. Whether any of the Heart challenges would work in the intended way (I'm sure that a few specific ones would not), I do not know. But that was my intent. And while there is a legitimate ethical criticism to be made of involving people in the game without their consent, I don't believe most of the Heart challenges in practice would actually represent anything approaching a serious ethical breach, or truly result in players just using others for their own pleasure. But I could be wrong.<br/><br/>That said, I'm pretty okay with the game being only a gedankenexperiment. Unless I get a burst of energy, I doubt I could finish a good or playable revision in time for the anthology. I think there is potential in this space, mapping fiction on to people-watching, but I don't have any fresh insights and so I expect I'll drop this as a design path for the time being. I do hope to keep designing games tho, and I have a few ideas I'm already scratching out, which by itself makes vomiting this thing onto the page a success for me (not to mention how cool it is to get kind and smart people to read it and talk about it with me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440775/#Comment_440775" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-09T20:22:06+00:00" title="December  9, 2014  8:22PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2014 8:23PM by Rickard.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I realized that me thinking that not that many players would talk to other people is a cultural thing.
