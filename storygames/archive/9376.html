We were down a player, so I played Lady B herself. And this time I was more prepared as a GM to play these characters as NPCs. I took a clue from another AP and had her start to boss the others around:)<br/><br/>I have been busy so I came to the table with absolutely zero prep.  That's right. I barely had time to find the character sheets before leaving the house.<br/><br/>So I decided to try something that I've done informally in the past. Which was to go around the table and have everyone give me one phrase about what they'd like to see this session. Could be a scene, location, color...anything. Doesn't necessarily need to involve their character.<br/><br/><b>Player Seeds:</b><br/><br/>-Badassery (more pulling off suicidal stuff)<br/>-Steampunk AI<br/>-Piloting through a running gunbattle<br/>-Hot blimp action (at that point we got into a discussion about how zeppelins were different from blimps because of their rigid airframes...yeah...)<br/>-Time machine?!<br/><br/><b>Story Notes:</b><br/><br/>So when we last left the group, the Owl had gotten cornered by three goblin pirate ships who uncloaked in front of their ship. And the crew somehow managed to hoodwink the pirated and steal the black globe cloaking device off one of their ships. Which Kale promptly jury-rigged to the back of the Owl, and they crept away.<br/><br/>The start of this session, they were still cloaking and heading for a planetoid called Perix Maximus on the edge of the Remnants, where a barkeep with criminal tendencies on Nightport had warned them an ambush was waiting for Lady's beloved Uriah.<br/><br/>Unfortunately they found out that the cloaking device actually created a seal around their ship, and like a submarine underwater, after several hours they were having trouble breathing and the lanterns on the ship were starting to fade. So they decided to turn the cloaking off until they really needed it.<br/><br/>They reached the bare planetoid and there appeared to be no one else around. Sensors indicated a number of heat sources on the surface. Snargle did a fine piece of piloting to land the Owl on the flat of a large crater.<br/><br/>The five intrepid adventurers (i.e. smugglers) disembarked, and Kale turned the cloaking device on so their ship couldn't easily be spotted.  Nearby they found one of many well-sized holes in the ground emanating what appeared to be geothermic steam.<br/><br/>Everyone looked at Snargle, who for his own goblin-self, looked very unsure until Captain Vance ordered him "into the hole!"<br/><br/>Snargle shapeshifted a bit to fit into the small hole, and used all of his wiles to crawl down. Even though he couldn't look down for awhile, he eventually felt his feet were no longer on rock, but on some sort of ladder or beams. <br/><br/>He finally looked down and got instant vertigo as he was standing at the top of a latticework of metal beams and junctions that went at least a mile straight down. Far down below he could see what looked like lightning bolts of energy passing from one place to another. And at the bottom was some sort of pink dome the size of a city block.<br/><br/>Our fearless Snargle crawled down to a junction box about 5 meters on a side, and opened a hatch to find a steam-powered tech droid working away at a big control panel. The droid went for the alarm button on the wall, but Snarg went for the robot jugular and ripped his metallic head off.<br/><br/>Back on the surface, the crew were calling down the hole to no avail. And then someone saw three lights coming from the distant space. Were those skyships approaching? Suddenly the ground opened up and Snargle appeared, riding an elevator platform that he had caught from the junction box.<br/><br/>The Owl was still cloaked, so the group decided to descend to the bottom to see what was there. So they took the mile long ride down on the exposed platform, passing innumerable maintenance bots scurring from place to place. <br/><br/>At the bottom they were faced with the huge pink membrane, and inside they could hear and barely see machines whirring away. Lady Blackbird uses her scientific background to tell the others that this must be some sort of huge calculating device. Perhaps the biggest in the galaxy! But what could they possibly be using it for?!<br/><br/>So of course Snargle pushes Kale inside. Kale gets sucked into the membrane, and promptly falls in-between several resistors. The entire thing starts to malfunction and power down, and klaxons and alarm lights start going on everywhere.<br/><br/>And to make things worse, the membrane is filled with some sort of gelatin-like goo which Kale breathes in and fills her lungs. Vance tried to pull her out, but gets sucked in himself. Holding his breath as long as possible, Vance grabs Kale's arm and uses his Secret of the Warpblood to teleport Kale several feet away, outside of the membrane. She instantly falls to all fours, retching the pink goo from her lungs. As Vance bangs against the inside of the membrane, Lady Blackbird actually looks...worried about Vance.<br/><br/>The rest of the crew jump into action, cutting off a nearby piece of pipe about a foot thick and 2-3 meters long. Which is then shoved through the hole towards Vance. Kale does a little sorcery to create a vacuum that sucks out enough good to allow Vance to use it as a breathing device. Then the group pulls with all their might and the Captain comes flying out, looking like someone who got slimed ala Ghostbusters.<br/><br/>(cont)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207860/#Comment_207860" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T22:27:42+00:00" title="May 17, 2009 10:27PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2009 11:24PM by Caesar_X.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Post #2)<br/><br/>The whole time, Snargle has been standing on the nearby platform, holding off the swarms of approaching bots with his stolen multi-barreled mutiny pistols. He shouts at the rest to hurry up. And even though they are very curious about the machine and who or what is powering it, they hear ships landing far away on the surface, and take the platform back up. Bolts of light fly towards them from the robots who are trying to stop them. A lucky shot fuses the platform hole to the pipe they are riding on. And the group has some tense moments while they shapeshift Snargle into a tool and use it to break off the fused metal and get themselves moving again.<br/><br/>They reached the surface in time to see three medium-sized ships landed in a triangle nearby, with a handful of men outside looking at the shimmering (similar to a heat haze) being caused by the cloaked Owl. Even though they are aways from them, recognition happens quickly and Lady Blackbird shouts "Uriah!!!" and starts running towards him.<br/><br/>At this point, Lady's bodyguard Naomi does what she's been planning for awhile, and decides to leave Lady's service since she won't need her with that dashing pirate captain around. She turns to Captain Vance, who offers her a job as security on the Owl.<br/><br/>Eventually the group walks over to Uriah, Lady and the others. Lady B is stunned that Naomi wants to leave her, and Vance has given up his secret longing for Lady after seeing her with Uriah. So they ask for what they really came for...the money. Which is paid in the form of a bag full of rare gems.<br/><br/>Lady tells Uriah all about the plans to ambush him here as well as about the secret files they found on him from the criminal barkeep on Nightport. Later in the Owl, Uriah pours through all the secret files and finds all sorts of interesting things. He asks to keep his own file, and tells them the barkeep is actually an Imperial spy. And he gives them a hint that these files could prove very interesting (and profitable) if they were to make their way to a certain Senator Brunbeck on Ilysium.<br/><br/>So the four crew said their goodbyes and left Lady Blackbird with her (surprised and not all that happy) lover Uriah Flint, who was going to stay on the strange AI planetoid to face his fate.<br/><br/>Next Session: Senators? Treasure skyships? Secret spy files??<br/><br/><b>Play Notes:</b><br/><br/>Towards the end of the session, there were several players who wanted to buy off Keys. Naomi bought off her 'Key of the Guardian' and replaced with it 'Key of the Conscience'. Cyrus replaced his 'Key of Hidden Longing' with 'Key of the Sacrifice': fiercely protective of his own crew. Hit key when you put yourself into danger to protect your crew. Buy off: sacrifice crew to save you own skin.<br/><br/>Snargle had an advance, and gained: 'Secret of the Sidekick: once per session, Vlad (Witherbottom, the mouse) can roll dice as if he were Snargle.<br/><br/>It was fun to have several advances this session which were used for more than just gaining new tags. But the play balance is a little weird as you get two advances from buying off a key. I might suggest that only one of these two advances can be used for a new key.<br/><br/>I also love how the crew said "meh" to Lady Blackbird as soon as she was reunited with Uriah. Jobs done...where's our money?!?<br/><br/>We definitely hit the end of a play chapter after three sessions of about 3-4 play time each. We might take a little break, but we all want to come back to this world and see what is in store for these characters next.<br/><br/>Not bad for an ~8 page game!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207868/#Comment_207868" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T23:16:18+00:00" title="May 17, 2009 11:16PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, this was an interesting session, because it really hit on how much I've personally fused dirty-hippy ideas about gaming with ultra old-skool ideas about gaming.<br/><br/>In the first and third sessions, no one was playing Natasha, but in the second session we had a really great player taking the part.The amount of relevance was directly related to having a real person involved. I doubt any of us at the table would have walked away from LB, if she was a player charcter, but as a GM character, she became scenery/color both other times.<br/><br/>Personally, I was really happy finishing the initial story-arc. While I'd like to visit these characters agin, I would be alright if nothing more came out of this. The play hit a very good spot for me. It didn't match up quite to other media, but seemed it's own thing in a way that a TV show, or book series, or movie with sequel options, or comic limited-series, couldn't quite hit.<br/><br/>I was left feeling...weird...about the ending.<br/><br/>I kinda don't want to rush back to this game. I want to let it simmer, and maybe come back and revisit these guys after time in the real world and in-game have passed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207869/#Comment_207869" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T23:20:32+00:00" title="May 17, 2009 11:20PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I was left feeling...weird...about the ending.</blockquote>\nMore detail, please.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207870/#Comment_207870" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T23:26:27+00:00" title="May 17, 2009 11:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more Play Note I forgot to mention:<br/><br/>We didn't use any Conditions this entire session.

Keys are certainly there for the buyoffs as well as the using, so it's cool that several people switched gears and changed up what the characters are about. Across various TSOY games I've found an almost 50/50 split among players who carefully play their Keys as written and players who immediately start setting up the buyoffs and working on a big character shift.<br/><br/>Buying off a Key and then taking two new ones is one of those "stop punching yourself" situations. It's allowed by the rules, but if it feels weird to you... yeah, don't do that.<br/><br/>Do you imagine that Lady Blackbird and Flint will appear in future stories, or does that element of the situation feel finished?

By the end of the third session, not only did I have a much better handle on mymechanical options, but Snargle was starting to become a good bit more competent. I think that was probably true of the other players and their characters as well.<br/><br/>Buying off a single Key seemed to do a lot for that, so I guess some general rules or guidelines on Key building would be good, as well as possibly some guidance to avoid ( or encourage, I suppose) Breeder-Key building. Maybe also some thoughts about hitting PCs with challenges that aren't as easy for the whole group to come in on.<br/><br/>In session one, we had a series of more individual challenges and only three players, plus the vharacters didn't have as many tags opened, so there was much more "comic relief" whoopsies results. By session two, we'd figured out how to pool our efforts on almost everything and had an extra tag or two individually. <br/><br/>I dunno, maybe talk a bit about creating entirely new Traits + tags as a way to expand the characters? I didn't see much of that happening. I think we all felt that we were better off overloading on specializing and building up existing trait+tag combos, so we'd have a big pool of dice to draw on when we did use that trait.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208309/#Comment_208309" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T10:36:51+00:00" title="May 20, 2009 10:36AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see.
