China's a big place, depending on the region and microculture those myths are different. maybe do a "toe in the water" shallow dive on Wikipedia, then maybe ask if you have specific questions that Wikipedia only touches on?<br/><br/>Also, it depends on the context. Are you running a game set in ancient China? Or looking to apply something to modern-day China?<br/><br/>Reason I ask that is because if someone asked me about "Japan", I could spout off various creation myths, but:<br/>* In modern day, people still believe strongly in Shinto superstition, which originated such creation stories, but<br/>* Most people either don't know the full creation stories, or if they do know them they think of them as funny/bullshit of a bygone era (like we would look at Roman/Greek gods, etc).<br/><br/>So in an ancient myth game or a game set in 7000BC to 1500AD or so, it might be topical. But by 1700-1900 most people rolled with Science where it conflicted with the tale of the Space Brother/Sister fucking and creating Japan with the afterward pull-out mess.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327859/#Comment_327859" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T18:32:09+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  6:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2011 6:32PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great... now I'm going to have to look up "Space Brother/Sister fucking" before I can get to the China work...<br/><br/>Your question about time frame is interesting. The context is.... how do I say this... I need a Glorantha like grasp on the "reality" of mythology, which is, in fact, hanging over the modern-world, imminent but unknown to most.<br/><br/>I'm looking to build a mythic plane of Chinese mythology that certain characters from the modern world can enter. Imagine, if you will, stepping from a remote village in modern day China into the Middle-Earth of Chinese Mythology, or the Chinese Narnia.

Thanks for clarifying.<br/><br/>Go to your library, and check out <b>SILVER PHOENIX by CINDY PON</b>. It's a female-centric (tho not "just for girls") young adult story. Simple story, simple characters, not an exceedingly interesting plot or dialogue, but serviceable. Likely she's just finding her voice, and later books will be better. If you can't find it or want my copy, whisper me and for like $3 I'll mail my hardcover copy to you.<br/><br/>It's a fantasy China setting in general, and within it even though the gods are ancient and hidden (no one really sees them in their lifetime), the main character and her friends get whisked to basically the Mythical China Domain of one of the major goddesses. That scene/chapter is really evocative, well-described, thoroughly asian* and can totally serve as gaming fodder.<br/><br/>There's a sequel to this book (haven't read it) which may have more of the same. However, with the uprising of more asia-centric fantasy particularly geared at young adults, I'm sure that someone will post another author or two that writes similar events/locations/themes into her/his stories. Anyone?<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* That is, more than just jade shit splashed around and tea and bowing humbly. It is not from real Chinese myth/legend description, but works in enough Otherness that would have been missed without research into some real legends/stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327869/#Comment_327869" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T18:54:16+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  6:54PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, sorry I might have misinterpreted one point:<br/><br/>Is the wold they can travel to basically a fantasy China analogue, or a fantasy China analogue where the ancient Gods live (like, their domains, as I was indicating in that Special Chapter of Silver Phoenix, above).<br/><br/>If the <b>latter</b>, then yeah Silver Phoenix.<br/><br/>If the <b>former,</b> then DOUBLE Silver Phoenix, plus go to its Amazon.com page and start looking at the "We recommend This as well" section, building your library list.<br/><br/>A wonderful Japanese take on ancient China is to be found in the wonderful anime (probably quite literally the best anime ever, due to the material and budget that NHK was swinging back in 2002-2004) "12 Kingdoms".<br/><br/>I would not recommend Wikipedia as much, then. Academic literature based on the era is dry shit with virtually no soul. Look to fiction written with heart by people who did the research for you for the best and juiciest RPG-usable text.<br/><br/>Oh, and if the latter (just ancient China, no myth), check for the old Usborne-style picture-books-for-kids for visually striking guidebooks.
