I'm a third-year PhD candidate in Communication &amp; Culture, and I specialize in digital game studies and cinema studies. (Bear in mind that this is intended for an audience that knows absolutely nothing about RPGs of any kind, so there are some pretty crass but necessary generalizations in the first paragraph.) If the paper gets accepted I'll post the whole thing when its written!\n<blockquote><b>The Set-Up, the Tilt and the Aftermath: Role-playing the Caper-Gone-Wrong Film in Fiasco</b><br/><br/>\t\u201cTabletop\u201d or \u201cpen and paper\u201d role-playing games (RPGs) are games in which players use a written system of rules to collaboratively play out an imaginary story, often using dice to introduce an element of chance. Historically, various editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons have dominated the form, but more recently a growing range of independently published RPGs have emerged as a self-reflexive alternative. Like mainstream RPGs, most indie games situate themselves in relation to familiar genres and settings from other cultural forms (Tolkienian fantasy, post-apocalyptic survival), but tend to emphasize improvisation, dynamic stories and character depth over the more straightforward \u201ckill monsters, steal treasure\u201d model popularized by Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>\tA handful of these games go a step further, simulating not only the kinds of stories told in other media, but also the narrative form of those stories. Jason Morningstar's Fiasco is a particularly successful example of this approach, and is designed to simulate the kind of \u201ccinematic tales of small-time capers gone disastrously wrong\u201d associated with Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and especially the Coen brothers. The players take on the roles of \u201cordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control\u201d undertaking fatally flawed and criss-crossed plots for personal gain that \u201ccollapse into a glorious heap of jealousy, murder, and recrimination.\u201d<br/><br/>\tGameplay proceeds as a series of \u201cscenes\u201d that drive the narrative towards its inexorably bloody conclusion. Unlike many other RPGs, the narrative in Fiasco is not required to be linear or centred on a unified time and place \u2013 flashbacks and \u201ccrosscutting\u201d between different events are common, further encouraging the players to imagine the game's story as a film. The central mechanic of the game (the distribution of positive and negative dice based on the outcome of individual scenes that ultimately determine the ending of the story) the overall gameplay structure (set-up, scenes divided into two acts interrupted by a twist, and a denouement) and the specific narrative elements that the game deploys (relationships, needs, locations and objects) work in tandem with the Saul Bass-style presentation of the game and references to films that inspired it, to enable the players to produce a shared, imaginary caper-gone-wrong movie, scene by scene.<br/><br/>\tFiasco can be seen as a sort of colloquial, playable film theory: the game must establish certain theoretical premises about the caper-gone-wrong genre in order to present it in terms of a system of game rules. Because it is a simulation, this system is selective and simplified \u2013 simulations value-laden and never neutral, always highlighting and de-emphasizing aspects of the source system. To say that Fiasco simulates the caper film is therefore to say that it presents a specific conception or interpretation of the caper film. Bearing this in mind, my analysis of Fiasco will focus on the particular elements and aspects of the caper narrative highlighted by the game's system of rules and its paratextual framing, and how they relate to the cinematic forms and conventions they simulate.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355136/#Comment_355136" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T12:36:27+00:00" title="January 20, 2012 12:36PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds really cool, Felan.

I looked at that program back when I was considering being a game studies academic. Hopefully it's working out for you!<br/><br/>The primogenitor of indie-RPG-as-film-studies-treatise is really Primetime Adventures (though of course there are earlier examples of film-inspired games, including the much-maligned Lawnmover Man!).  I'm not sure how directly PTA inspired Fiasco (I imagine a lot), but it influenced the language of indie RPGs and you still see it in things like "scene framing" and the use of phrases like "and...cut!" at the end of scenes.  Fiasco and Geiger Counter were effectively parallel developments in an attempt to make GM-less, cooperative, single-session, film-inspired games that would be super easy to pick up and play with folks unfamiliar with hippie games. Both of them have been very successful in that regard, though Geiger's still unfinished. They have a lot in common with PTA, but the shift to movies led them both to a unified narrative arc (measured, in both cases, by dice) rather than the individual narrative arcs of PTA. They both also use rotating scene-framing responsibilities and use strong genre tropes as a way of getting everyone on the same page in the absense of a GM. PTA's influence is very much evident in the focus on film-related concepts like "sets" (locations), "props," motivations, and relationships.<br/><br/>In any event, just some additional context, which may or may not be relevant to what you want to talk about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355152/#Comment_355152" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T13:53:55+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  1:53PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh cool, it's a great program, although gigantic. I constantly meet people who I've never seen before and then find out they're ComCulters.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of PTA (haven't tried Geiger... yet), and I seriously considered making the paper about both PTA and Fiasco, but I decided not to just for the sake of doing an in-depth case study. I chose Fiasco because I'm more familiar with film studies than with TV studies (and also because I love the caper-gone-wrong genre), but there's a <i>lot</i> going on in PTA that would be really interesting to talk about. Frequently the rule book reads like a TV screenwriting manual, which I think is fascinating. Plus, it's even more explicit about encouraging the use the language of the television industry as a framing device (the pitch, the producer), televisual form and style to describe scenes (fade outs, pans, smash cuts, etc) in conjunction with the serialized narrative form of popular TV shows. Great stuff! If the Fiasco paper goes well maybe I'll expand it for publication to include other games, or write a sequel paper (or I guess a prequel, since PTA came first).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355168/#Comment_355168" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T15:25:58+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  3:25PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shouldn't they be ComCultists? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Yeah, I was just suggesting that PTA might be worth a footnote, for all the influence it's had on later games. Believe me, I'm all about single case studies rather than trying to do everything at once.<br/><br/>Good luck with your submission and let us know how it goes! Having more academic papers out there about games gives us all more things to cite, so it's hugely beneficial.

This was written for a specific conference - the Film Studies Association of Canada - where I knew most people who would come to my panel would at least be familiar with stereotypical representations gaming in general if not D&amp;D specifically. Likewise, if I pursue the paper further it will be for an academic game studies audience. So, I don't think it's overly presumptuous to use D&amp;D in the first few paragraphs as a way of contextualizing what is unique about <i>Fiasco</i>.<br/><br/>(Side note: I think people would be vastly more baffled by the word "verbalize" than "play out."

Is that a subset of stories written in this mode? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are caper stories where the heroes aren't doomed losers (Hitchcock's "To Catch a Thief" perhaps?) But Fiasco is largely driven by giving players the permission to act badly (letting players who are normally a very controlled subculture embrace the "Stop Making Sense" ethos need for improvisational performance)  by prefacing everything in an imaginitive environment where your character is someone less desireable than yourself already and therefore one you are more free to make mistakes in playing. Thus the "poor impulse control" coda of the title.<br/>\n<br/>\nI notice you address this on pages 8 and 9, with a couple frequent references to Saul Bass (I'm thinking Man with the Golden Arm, but I'm not sure if that's the same poster design.)  And you wrap it all up with a note that the caper-gone-wrong genre circulates outside the cinema. I'm curious about that, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380781/#Comment_380781" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T20:38:00+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  8:38PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, yeah - the caper is definitely distinct from the caper-gone-wrong (or the "fatal caper," which might be a better term for the kind of stories <i>Fiasco</i> produces). Not all capers-gone-wrong have the kind of ironic distance found in Coen brothers movies, but I think <i>Fiasco</i> adopts that irony very heavily in its particular interpretation of the sub-genre. The distancing is also produced in the playing of terrible characters - because everyone knows you don't identify with the idiotic small-time crook you're playing there's a natural distance (while in more heroic games, maybe you do identify with the good guy you're playing). Choosing to have your character make a mistake, rather than doing what's obvious, requires a certain detachment from the fictional world.<br/><br/>As for the idea of the genre circulating outside of cinema, in my conception (adopted from a host of much smarter scholars of genre), genres are complicated, incoherent, overlapping assemblages that encapsulate all kinds of divergent ideas in many different media. Some examples of capers-gone-wrong in other media might include the Kane &amp; Lynch video games, the Parker novels (and their various film and comic book adaptations), and even some genres of popular music (Ghostface Killah's "Maxine" is a fantastic example). The idea of the genre is mobilized in different ways and in many different contexts - if you're interested, the book <i>More Than Night: Film Noir in its Contexts</i> does a great job of demonstrating how to understand genres, tendencies, cycles and movements in this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442380/#Comment_442380" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-02T16:54:13+00:00" title="February  2, 2015  4:54PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For posterity, an updated/streamlined version of this paper was just published over at Analog Game Studies: <a href="http://analoggamestudies.org/2015/02/role-playing-the-caper-gone-wrong-film-in-fiasco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://analoggamestudies.org/2015/02/role-playing-the-caper-gone-wrong-film-in-fiasco/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442473/#Comment_442473" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-04T22:25:49+00:00" title="February  4, 2015 10:25PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!
