There are only so many notes the royal ear can hear in an evening." (To which Mozart replies, "Which notes should I cut out?")<br/><br/>So how many bits in a game can a gamer be expected to keep in their head at once? How many angles / stances / Power Pools / Factions / Influences / Powers / Abilities / Compels / whatever?<br/><br/>In Spirit of the Century you've got 10 aspects, 5 stunts, and however many skills to keep track of, your Fate Points, plus the bits of business that evolve during play like Tagging the Aspect of a scene (it's foggy) or compeling the Aspect of a villain (Dr. Volcano sleeps with his teddy bear!).<br/><br/>In Mortal Coil, you've got your Action chips, your Power chips, your Passion chips, your Magic chips. You've got however many Magic rules have been created, your Passions, your Faculties, your Aptitudes. <br/><br/>In Burning Wheel....you've got a lot. Too much for me to remember off the top of my head. Artha (different flavors of it), your character's lifepaths, your Instincts, etc., etc.<br/><br/>In Werewolf: the Apocalypse you had your Tribe, your Auspice, your Breed, your Gifts, your Rage, Gnosis and Willpower, Attributes, and Abilities (Skills/Talents/Knowledges).<br/><br/><br/>I'm not criticizing these games. I like them. I just wonder. So how much can we expect our players to hold in their "temporary memory"? I know character sheets are for when people forget. But I think a game really "gets going" when people know their character and its abilities well enough to play without much reference to the sheet.<br/><br/>Let me know what you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136287/#Comment_136287" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T11:12:24+00:00" title="March 25, 2008 11:12AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to get all scientifical, you might tailor your fiddly bits based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#Working_memory_capacity" rel="nofollow">working memory capacity</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136288/#Comment_136288" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T11:12:44+00:00" title="March 25, 2008 11:12AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A nearly-infinite number.

For instance, in D&amp;D, I know most of my character's powers because he's been using them for several levels and I've thrown them around a lot. I remember a lot of monster stats because I've run into them quite a bit and relatively recently, though I sometimes remember stats for older-edition monster better. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>It's how many <i>new things come up</i> in a particular scene that causes me to get confused.

The implication of the GM modifying the game to make it work, often in rather undocumented ways, is that power distribution in the game is unbalanced between GM and players. That is, the GM now knows the algorithms behind the universe, while the players are hapless victims of rules they cannot hope to comprehend.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that GMs are evil. I'm saying that with such power distribution, the GM might as well be evil. To put it another way, whether God exists but is out for your throat, or whether God doesn't exist and your suffering is caused by ignorance and random chance, are synonymous.<br/><br/>This is obviously very conducive to extreme Sim play, where the players can simply state what their characters do and the GM/rules-complex (in such a game, the two are not separate entities) acts as a black box, feeding them back a plausible result. I don't have a problem with this if that's what players (GM inclusive) want.<br/><br/>But I <b>do</b> have a problem with the statement that ultra-complex smorgasbord rules systems intended for GM customization are somehow generally useful, and that such design principles are generally a good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136477/#Comment_136477" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T09:44:33+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  9:44AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry, Lachek, but we're not describing a situation where the GM mods the rules and doesn't share what they are, I think what everyone is talking about is the GM taking the basic toolset, making a coherent (for him) tool, and then distributing it amongst players.<br/>At that point, they all know what the algorithms are, or can find out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136479/#Comment_136479" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T09:59:11+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  9:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2008 10:00AM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I'm sorry, Lachek, but we're not describing a situation where the GM mods the rules and doesn't share what they are, I think what everyone is talking about is the GM taking the basic toolset, making a coherent (for him) tool, and then distributing it amongst players.<br/>At that point, they all know what the algorithms are, or can find out.</blockquote>\nI get that. I have nothing against house rules that are widely distributed and understood among all the players. I just have never, ever, in decades of gaming with several dozens of gamers in two different countries, seen that actually happen with systems like GURPS or HERO. What I <b>have</b> seen is GMs using the rules they feel are interesting and important, ignoring others, applying yet others in some occasions and not at other occasions, and assuming that total knowledge of the rules is their job and their job alone. Regardless of best intentions or what great people they are away from the gaming table. It's a symptom of rule complexity.<br/><br/>This probably looks like nothing but an annoying tangent in the thread, but it's actually very central to it. In a game where the rules are not intended to simulate physical reality, it's <i>imperative</i> for players to know the rules - maybe not inside and out, but well enough that they can reliably use them to serve their creative goals. For most players who aren't rules junkies, that means Keep It Simple Stupid. Complex smorgasbords like GURPS and HERO work well for what they do, but they sure as hell aren't "generic" in the "totality of available role-playing experiences" sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136489/#Comment_136489" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T10:22:57+00:00" title="March 26, 2008 10:22AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SambearPoet</cite>So how much can we expect our players to hold in their "temporary memory"?

Maybe you mean "the other players of the game I'm GMing". Please specify.<br/><br/>I am very much coming to understand that the traditional roles of the GM are redistributable, so I am going to say the answer to this question is the former.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>For most games, you can expect a different level of investment from GMs and other players. This is especially true in games where the GM drives the story, since they tend to be heavily invested into that story. The level of investment drives the mental energy people are willing to expend in learning and remembering the fiddly bits of a game. As a GM, I have been known to remember the stats on all the other players' sheets better than they do.</blockquote>\nHell, yes. This makes perfect sense, and checks out against some other knowledge I've taken from the past. When I was running games for my kids I was always pleasantly surprised the amount of detail they recalled. Absorption of lore, facts, organized systems of information was something they did as well as they breathed. I believe this was in part due to the fact that they were invested / engaged. They certainly didn't learn their multiplication tables with the same vigor.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>This is why BW/BE requires a lot of player investment, compared both to GURPS and to D&amp;D - there's a lot of fiddly bits and they apply equally to GM and players.<br/><br/>This is why players can't be expected to remember all the house rules, exceptions and expansions a GM may opt to use (regardless of the fact that they never actually own all those books and can peruse them at their leisure).</blockquote>\nI am seeing that I am going to need to strike a balance, and that it will probably only come out in playtesting as to whether I am successful or not with the design. <br/><br/>Thanks, this got me thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SambearPoet" title="SambearPoet"><img alt="SambearPoet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/993/n5R7M0VMJNJWY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SambearPoet">SambearPoet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139130/#Comment_139130" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T16:30:08+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  4:30PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>Cool Jason.

Maybe I'll come up with a GM sheet that you fill out after all chargen is done to help a GM zero in on flags and to assist in dealing with the fiddly bits.
