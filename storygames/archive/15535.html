I use a fairly standard technique of providing them with a starting situation (usually In Media Res) and a "long-term" goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nI let the players figure out how they get to that goal and all the good stuff that comes between. I let them fill in the gaps using something similar to the InSpectres method of successful die rolls allowing players to create clues that lead to the next objective. The problem comes with pacing. Sometimes things work well and the group has a grand adventure trying to complete the goal, coming up with several of their own objectives that must be met in order to progress towards the end goal, each objective complicating their own lives but making a much better story (and they even feel that way after the game). Sometimes the group feels like they should be able to solve the goal in one scene, leading to a less than satisfying gaming session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was considering implementing something whereby the players must complete X number of smaller objectives before reaching and resolving the goal. The objectives would be left up to the players to create themselves and drawn from the narrative, but it gives them a guideline on how many milestones they must reach before the story reaches its climax. This controls the pacing a bit better, but still leaves control up to the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce they choose the next logical objective to progress the story towards its goal, they would make the InSpectres roll to add details about the people, places, and things that would help them reach the objective.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts? Is there a better way to achieve what I'm trying to do? Is this a terrible idea?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352207/#Comment_352207" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T19:14:52+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  7:14PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is going to depend on the game.

I really feel this will add to the pulpy style of SotC though!<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely like the Agon approach. I just need to meld it with InSpectres now. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's how I am possibly envisioning this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after the players complete one objective, they will each ask one question. The GM will ask one question for each PC. The players will pick one question (not necessarily their own) and Investigate! Investigate uses similar skills as InSpectres (I've added one, but it shouldn't make a difference). They roll the dice. For the successes, they each get to create and add facts concerning people, places, and things. They then cooperatively create the next objective using all the clues they created individually. Next, its time to go get that objective!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis process will be done X times (whatever the GM dictates) before the main goal can be resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think? I think this will give the players the narrative control over the story that I'm wanting, but still letting the GM dictate the pace at which the main goal is accomplished. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know if this is just a ridiculous notion! I'm new to the rules design/tweaks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'm new to Design Theory as a whole.....Does allowing the players to create the next step violate the Czege Principal?

They'll automatically calibrate the pace of the story to what they're interested in, zooming in and out of areas of the story. If I'm more interested in this part (the wedding ceremony), I'll set small goals ("Can I carry the candles to the altar?"). If I'm not interested at all in another part of the story (the fight on the mountaintop, I can name a goal at the scale that interests me ("Can we defeat our enemies and make it to the Eastern coast on time?").<br/><br/>The only restriction I would set would be to make sure that everyone realizes any named goal must be believably achievable in the current scene. So if someone says, "I want to fly to the moon!", you respond, "OK, how?" And that probably generates some other smaller goal. <br/><br/>But if they're sitting in a rocket on the launchpad, and they want their goal to be "landing on the moon", it tells you that they're not all that interested in playing out the journey to get there. And why would you want to make them play through something they're not interested in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352328/#Comment_352328" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T01:49:34+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  1:49AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, my game puts pacing firmly in the hands of the players.

If You are giving the players narrative control over setting their objectives, your role would be best served by challenging their attempts to achieve those objectives. The pacing is largely then dictated by the players, with the GM having the opportunity to throw more or less obstacles in the way. Failure to achieve a set goal twists the story in another direction (a new goal to achieve - a new challenge to overcome). <br/>\n<br/>\nAre the players being mechanically rewarded for chasing their goals?

Where you say "they create and add facts" I'd say "they declare new Aspects and assess Aspects that the GM created." You declare with knowledge skills and assess with perception skills (see p. 83). I think it's worth keeping the declare/assess distinction, so those skills feel distinctive in play.<br/><br/>One tweak we've done that works well: Instead of assessing and simply getting an Aspect from the GM, the players can ask questions about the subject, and get an Aspect from that. Like, "does he have anything that involves his history in the Crimson Brotherhood?" "Yep! He has the 'Champion of the Brotherhood' aspect." Making it a Q&amp;A lets the GM add an aspect on the spot if the players ask an especially cool question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352484/#Comment_352484" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-25T19:31:04+00:00" title="December 25, 2011  7:31PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2011 3:30PM by TylerT.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pacing is a great thing to think about!<br/><br/>As far as "player driven" stories i think there needs to be a large rethink of what kind of choices are meaningful to players and what are not.<br/><br/>pacing and the elements of the game that are related to pacing are not meaningful choices for players but are super important elements of a game's design.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Demiurge</cite>I find that pacing can be really hard to get right in an automated way (i.e. using rules and no human judgement), especially if you want it to work every time.</blockquote>\nInterestingly i have not had this problem in my own game. but I have seen it in many others. in many ways I think it's a problem of the structure being too open and not too tight. For example a fiasco scene can take a really long time if the players are not doing it right, making the entire game of fiasco run way over if you play the number of scenes dictated by the game. the problem is not saying you must play a number of scenes but that each scene does not have a strong structure to it. but a game with a tighter moment to moment structure paired with a tighter scene structure can be very successful.<br/><br/>So I think saying "you must reach x number of goals" is a good thought but i think it will only work if you then divide the structure of "goal" down into number of scenes and then play a game that regulates the scene length well.<br/><br/>i would even go so far as to say players do not need a choice in a character's goals but simply a choice of method on how that goal is reached. basically the deus ex formula where players are given an open ended goal and allowed to reach it through a few different methods. players already choose a goal when they choose what game to play. in other words it's really stupid to ask someone if they are going into the dungeon during a game of "dungeon and dragons" entering a dungeon is a "non-choice"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JustinA" title="JustinA"><img alt="JustinA" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JustinA">JustinA</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352491/#Comment_352491" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-25T23:58:42+00:00" title="December 25, 2011 11:58PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing a lot of Technoir lately, which has me thinking about vectors.<br/><br/>By way of explanation, Technoir features a mechanic that allows a player to push an adjective onto another character or object. (For example, you might push "crippled" onto Bill's character. That then becomes part of the fiction, has to be respected, and also has mechanical consequences.) The important part of this is that you can't always "skip to the end"; you have to be able to establish a proper vector.<br/><br/>Similar thinking applies to the situation you're talking about, I think: You've got players who are skipping straight from "there's a murder" to "I catch the murderer" and that's problematic for you. The solution is to look at the vector they're using to achieve "I solve the murder". And the question is, have they actually positioned themselves<br/><br/>So, for example:<br/><br/>"I catch the murderer."<br/>"How are you doing that?"<br/>"I go to where he is."<br/>"Okay, well first you need to determine where he is."<br/>"I go to where he is."<br/>"How are you doing that?"<br/>"I figure out who he is."<br/>"How are you doing that?"<br/><br/>And you've established the vector: You need to figure out who he is, then you need to figure out where he is, and then you can catch him.<br/><br/>Of course, this conversation could just as easily go:<br/><br/>"I catch the murderer."<br/>"How do you do that?"<br/>"I set a trap for him."<br/>"How do you do that?"<br/>"I'll announce to all the party guests that the victim has actually survived and ask if anyone knows shorthand so that dictation can be taken in the Master Bedroom."<br/><br/>And that, obviously, gives you a different vector.<br/><br/>In practice, this is similar to playing a traditional RPG with a flexible GM. Where the players get narrative control, however, is dictating that a particular vector will work. (For example, in the traditional RPG the murderer might not be at the party or he might not fall for the bluff or the plan might fail for any number of other reasons even if the GM is perfectly open to the possibility of its success. With narrative control, the players can either dictate or determine whether or not the guy is at the party.)<br/><br/>I don't have play experience with InSpectres, but my understanding is that it does something pretty similar with its Job dice: You collect Job dice through successful checks, but you can't actually complete the mission until you've collected the pre-defined number of Job dice required. If the players end the mission prematurely, then they get penalized half the Job dice. You'll notice the mechanical incentive to avoid "jumping to the end": The game is forcing the players to improvise vector paths of sufficient complexity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge" title="Demiurge"><img alt="Demiurge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/684/n5EMN506IRUMS.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">Demiurge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352528/#Comment_352528" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-27T07:14:45+00:00" title="December 27, 2011  7:14AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hi Tyler,</p>\n<p>Tyler wrote:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>So I think saying "you must reach x number of goals" is a good thought but i think it will only work if you then divide the structure of "goal" down into number of scenes and then play a game that regulates the scene length well.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is a very, very good point!</p>\n<p>How does Fiasco use its rules to make sure that each scene is kept to the right length?</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>For example a fiasco scene can take a really long time if the players are not doing it right</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I find it very hard sometimes to tell the difference between (A) a rule not being good and (B) the rule being good but people are using it wrong.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>--Jonathan</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352575/#Comment_352575" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-27T23:24:37+00:00" title="December 27, 2011 11:24PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hey Jonathan<br/><br/>It's helpful to distinguish between rule and principle. a well written rule can't generally be used wrong, rules are just hard facts and clear cut orders. where a principle is much looser advice as to how to play the game.<br/><br/>Princible says fiasco scenes should be short but there are no rules about it (as far as I know, I have played the game a bunch but never actually read fiasco so i dont know for sure) <br/><br/>not many games actually have pacing structures for individual scenes, my game uses one and its pacing or play time is about as predictable as a board game's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
