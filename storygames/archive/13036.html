It was absolutely fantastic. I recorded the entire session and might* be able to post the audio for it soon, in case anyone wants to hear the undigested version.<br/><br/>The concept was that we were a group of D&amp;D players going on a camping trip together, and the borders between reality and our game blurred. So it was a game-within-a-game.<br/><br/>I don't know how familiar with Dread you might be, but for basics of the game, check out the RPG.net review I linked to above. There were a few interesting twists to this game, though: there wasn't one questionnaire per character, but rather, one set for the player-archetypes that we chose and one set for the D&amp;D classes our characters played. So all the questions were about our first-order characters, but the <em>set</em> of questions was defined by both our choice of first-order and second-order character.<br/><br/>We had the Charismatic/Fighter, the Organizer/Wizard, the Newbie/Bard and the New-ager/Druid. The characters got up before dawn to go see the sunrise on a ridge in the mountains where they were camping, but found that the GM (an NPC) was missing. They saw a light in a cave nearby, and went to investigate.<br/><br/>What followed was a down-the-rabbit-hole adventure, where the characters found the DM's bag with a map of the cave they were in, goblins, another party of D&amp;D adventurers, and made their way, eventually, to the altar in the goblin temple, which, they had discovered, could grant a single wish in exchange for a human sacrifice. By this time, the borders between the first-order and second-order characters had blurred, and they kept forgetting which world they were in.<br/><br/>And here's the key point: we had not, once, toppled the tower, though we kept coming perilously close to it. Until the Organizer/Wizard made his way to the altar, and chose to sacrifice himself to rescue the rest\u2014though his choice of <em>himself</em> was in doubt up until the last moment. And here's where the physical presence of the tower made all the difference: rather than just knocking down the tower in sacrifice, I began to pull out a structurally-necessary block from the bottom. At the very last possible moment before the tower would fall, another player\u2014and their first/second order character\u2014shouted out to stop. And I did. And there was room for a tense discussion, before I nudged it just that one extra millimeter, because he had called the Organizer/Wizard by his second-order, not first-order, name. Trigger d\xe9nouement.<br/><br/>The tower was very interesting. It shaped our choices the whole game, making us avoid certain actions and take certain hits when we didn't think they were worth the risk. But because of the rabbit-hole nature of the whole story, we knew we had to act. Every time we didn't take a pull was a moment where we backslid further from escape.<br/><br/>I think that hope is a <em>very</em> important ingredient to Dread.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>* I recorded this for a research project into discourse structure in tabletop gaming, and therefore I'm bound by my institution's IRB in certain respects. I may need their approval before I can make the audio public. I already have the approval of the participants, at least! If I post it, it'll be at my blog, which you can get to through my profile.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>There's another aspect to this that I think is important, and that's GM preparation. <a href="http://twitter.com/worldnamer" rel="nofollow">Our wonderful GM</a> put a lot of work into this story before he ran it, making branches for the story that were meaningfully different and hinged on decisions, not on randomness. He also did some work and research to see how many pulls a Jenga tower could take before destabilizing, and timed his scenes accordingly, with estimates of the number of pulls that should occur in each to make the arc of the story line up with the progression of the tower. I'll try to see if I can get that information from him. I think that a risk with Dread is that the tower might tell a story at one pace, and the fiction at another pace. His work made that not a worry.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293973/#Comment_293973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-19T19:24:08+00:00" title="September 19, 2010  7:24PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kobutsu</cite>And here's where the physical presence of the tower made all the difference: rather than just knocking down the tower in sacrifice, I began to pull out a structurally-necessary block from the bottom.

I'm the GM for the Dungeons and Dread game. Thanks to kobutsu for his kind words.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis gets a bit difficult to talk about, so let me set some terms. When I say player, I mean the actual player of the Dread game. When I say character, I mean the first-order character that each player adopted - a Charismatic DnD player who plays a fighter. When I say second-order character, I mean that fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the actual presentation of the game and its content, there's a lot going on. Essentially, it's a descent into madness game that uses metainformation to help create in the player the same blending-of-worlds confusion that occurs in their character. It relies on the players knowing at least a little bit about common fantasy tropes, on them being able to distinguish between those tropes and reality, and on them having difficulty in doing so while actually playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen designing the game, I used some specific techniques to emphasize these aspects of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor one, the separation of the questionaire had the effect of subtly suggesting that there would be two halves to the person they played. I put more questions on the "player" part of the questionaire, but I put more interesting questions on the "character" part. Most of the questions that would suggest that a character had some useful talents (such as the fighter's naturally hearty build or the sorceror's wand) were on their character side of the questionaire. This was done to try to associate the aspects which were helpful in their character with the second-order character in an effort to make the player's question who they would rather be playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nA second technique was in providing enough narrative space to the players that they could decide how the story would go. This was fundamental to the game - without it, it's just a sequence of horrible things that happen to some people. I made sure to include a significant decision point where the players would have to choose whether to be heroes and rescue some captured friends, or to be rationalists and look for dwarven help, or to be survivalists and strike out on their own. Because it's the player's decision what tack to take, they own the consequences of their actions. It should provoke them to ask the question "What kind of person am I? Am I a hero, like my character? Or, I mean, my character's character?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI had planned a few scenes that didn't make it into the story, primarily because my players were so engaged that to add more content would be to interrupt the exact kind of in-character discourse I was trying to promote. I had planned to have an encounter with fungi such as a Shrieker/Violet Fungus. I wanted to throw in a rust monster. But the discussion at the table was about how they'd just been attacked by goblins. GOBLINS. WHAT THE HELL?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rationale behind the game was that, being a occasional DnD player myself, I've often reflected on the absurdity that it is. Corridors are ten feet wide, goblins are laughably weak, looting a corpse is grim. I wanted to bring those elements into a story that was definitively not DnD and see what happened. And on the list of dumb stuff that we do in DnD that actually happened: inter-party fighting (an awesome scene where the Fighter body-checked the Organizer with a spear, and almost got his head blown off by a wand), the Sorceror running far ahead of the group (over a chasm bridge, for fear that it was like Khazad Dum), using a ten-foot pole (packed by the Newcomer, who hadn't realized that gear was just for in-game stuff), searching a goblin for treasure... I'm sure there's more. While the characters were more reserved at the beginning, they slowly began to slip into their second-order characters and revert to classic DnD problem solving.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the best way that this manifested was in having the players pull so their characters would retain their sense of identity. With each pull, they would cling to their slivers of reality while the tower grew ever more rickety. And if they lost their grip, then they'd be adventurers, which is almost certainly worse. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294116/#Comment_294116" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T20:02:25+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  8:02PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2010 8:04PM by Tavis.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kobutsu</cite>* I recorded this for a research project into discourse structure in tabletop gaming, and therefore I'm bound by my institution's IRB in certain respects.

But not nearly as subtly or deftly as all that. I ran a straight up, D&amp;D adventurers-style dungeon crawl, but I emphasized that lack of visibility, the cramp spaces, and the fact that death in so many forms waited around the next corner. I ran it several times, actually. And each time I had this moment much like your GOBLINS, WHAT THE HELL? moment. There was a part of dungeon where it became clear that the adventurers would have to swim through an underground pool to get to the other side of a wall that lowered into it. As they approached the water they heard this deep groaning coming from all around. Usually it would play out like this:<br/><br/>A fighter or barbarian would strip down, oil up his weapon, and wade into the water. Eventually, he'd have to put his head underwater. Something would brush up against him and he was up like a shot--shouting for a light. Either the cleric or the wizard would provide some sort of illumination that would work underwater (magic was delightfully freeform, all it cost was a pull from the tower*). Our intrepid hero would then dunk down again start swimming. It would not be long before he'd spot something swimming for him. A gator! <br/><br/>This alone caused panic. It was so delicious to see a hardened fantasy warrior sweating it out because of an encounter with a real life critter. A critter one <i>should</i> be worried about, mind you. But it doesn't end there. Because as our gator approaches with lightning speed, our warrior would lash out with whatever weapon he had, forcing the creature to rear back and strike with it's spear.<br/><br/>Every single time I ran that scenario, the reveal that the gator was a lizardman dropped jaws. An alligator was one thing, but an alligator that could use tools? Get me the fuck out of here.<br/><br/>It was so satisfying to take a throw-away opponent and make them as terrifying as the fiction the genre was based on would.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* In one game, in the middle of a battle with a giant centipede, which was fucking creepy, I had a cleric fall to his knees and pray to Thor. The player than turned to me and ask if Thor's favor would allow him to take a block from the top of the tower and put it back in the middle of the tower. That was awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294168/#Comment_294168" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T09:38:36+00:00" title="September 21, 2010  9:38AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Epidiah, that sounds *awesome* and exactly the kind of effect I was trying to evoke. <br/>\n<br/>\nI considered running mine as a straight-up DnD adventure, but I think there's a subtle point about how Dread operates: Dread does a particular kind of horror game well - suspense horror. Survival horror (such as with an average "zombies attack" game) or mystery horror (such as with Call of Cthulhu inspired games) are both better served with other systems. Thus, I was hoping to shape the experience into one that's more slow-reveal, to play to Dread's strength.

Dread is more <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> than <i>Resident Evil</i> in that respect. If someone wants to go around blowing away zombies, Dread might not be your game. But you want to go around running away from zombies, then Dread works.<br/><br/>I used to be really strict about this, advising people not to run Dread unless they want to run a horror game. Which is to say a game in which the characters experience horror, not just a game in which they encounter horror tropes. It's kind of a blurred distinction nowadays. <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, <i>Army of Darkness</i>, and <i>Hellblazer</i>, for example, are not only part of the horror genre, but particularly popular parts as well. They are not, however, the parts Dread was designed for. And anyone sitting down to play Buffy, Ash, or John Constantine in a Dread game is in for a bit of a shock.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to wonder if that's just because these non-suspense-focused sub-genres of horror stand out precisely because they don't focus on suspense. When you play them in Dread, the focus points it back into the genre, instead of out, and the games look nothing like the subject matter. If you step entirely out of the genre, however, it all interacts in new and interesting ways.<br/><br/>The webpage for what I'm looking for seems to be <a href="http://plainvanilla.typepad.com/soap/2010/06/pendragon-using-dread-jenga-actual-play.html" rel="nofollow">down</a>, but here's the <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:A7dSFCRFbRgJ:plainvanilla.typepad.com/soap/2010/06/pendragon-using-dread-jenga-actual-play.html+pendragon+dread+jenga&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">Google cache of it</a>. It's a Pendragon game run with Dread. And the possibilities in it are pretty damn cool. It follows the tower's progression by making the fresh knights cocky and glory hounds, but when big bad rolls in, they really have to step up to the tower. I've not played this yet, but ever since I read about it, I've wanted to.<br/><br/>But going back to your game, I think you're absolutely right. Splitting the characters in two and blurring the lines between player and player character and player character is a great way to make Dread sing. This is something I'm going to have to try some time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296757/#Comment_296757" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T17:23:11+00:00" title="October 13, 2010  5:23PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2010 5:24PM by kobutsu.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>And finally, I've had the time to (minimally) edit the audio and put it up on for anyone who's interested.
