There were aspects from fate, and index cards and sharpies, lots of agency everywhere, oh and double the sexyness. We had a blast playing high school alchemysts during the 2nd American Revolution, but most of us just wanted to make a friend or be kissed for the first time.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150490591016484.396074.593716483&amp;type=1&amp;l=5cc263a47d" rel="nofollow">Pictures on the Facebooks</a><br/><br/><br/>What holiday games did you play?

The Beloved was Kristen, head elf, whose dream was to have a perfect holiday season.  The Suitors were Trixie, a short, larcenous Santa's Helper (Santa being her uncle), and Darla, a dour pre-med student volunteering at the charity-sponsored gift-wrapping booth.  They were vying for a New Year's Eve date with Kristen.  Stern store management!  Stern charity management!  Whiny children! Whinier parents! Carolers in period costume!  Drunk Santa!  Drunk college girls wanting picture with drunk Santa! Hostage crisis with deranged, fired, drunk Santa!<br/><br/>We all wanted to know more about the secret life of one of the NPCs, Bill, the store handyman, who we discovered was more comfortable as Willa.  Need to cover up a shoplifting dye explosion?  Willa's got the make-up.  Need to charm a couple cops when the Christmas party gets too rowdy?  Willa's got the moves.

It's quite cool and actually deserves its own thread.)  Santa didn't end up being in the Freeasco, but there was lots of behind-the-scenes badness with drug-dealing elves, age-inappropriate seduction, and a mysterious left-behind present that the mall security guard was afraid might be a bomb but which turned out to only be a human head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352558/#Comment_352558" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-27T15:42:46+00:00" title="December 27, 2011  3:42PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>(Do people here know about Freeasco?
