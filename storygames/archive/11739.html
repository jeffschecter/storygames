The question was inspired by my experience playing the <a href="http://www.darksiders.com/" rel="nofollow">Darksiders</a> demo in which one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, War, is made into a playable character with all the general hyper-power fantasy that entails.<br/><br/>The game has a pretty involved story by all accounts, but the thing that interests me the most are the Angelic Host that are introduced early on.  They are, like War himself, beefed up versions of Old Testament angels, complete with <a href="http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/2100000/Wrath-of-War-concept-art-Angel-darksiders-2152298-673-762.jpg" rel="nofollow">armor and weapons to match</a> the milieu.<br/><br/>Playing angels is nothing new.  Mayfair Games made an angelic supplement for D&amp;D a long while back and there are <i>In Nomine</i> and <i>Engel</i> that I can think of off the top of my head.  Heck didn't TSR do a quasi-angelic thing with D&amp;D before WotC took them over?<br/><br/>The problem?  I've played none of these games and know next to nothing about them except that there are angels involved.  What I want to know is: do they support play involving badass angels versus badass demons in a world of badassery?  I'd even be interested in something that would develop along the lines of the movie, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_(film)" rel="nofollow">Gabriel</a>.  At least there is much the action involved.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that I'm totally disinterested in the "human" side of the equation.  A game without anything beyond hyper-violent ass-kicking has a limited lifespan, as I said <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11738" rel="nofollow">in the other thread</a>.  But I'd like to see something that amps up the classic conflict between Light and Dark to near-Biblical proportions.  Do those games do that, or am I better off looking elsewhere?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/angelsdemons.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262414/#Comment_262414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T02:18:07+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  2:18AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2010 2:20AM by Destriarch.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Nomine is more about politics than anything, though you could have bad-ass angels in it I guess. Engel I'm less familiar with, but I think it's even less open to bad-assery than Innom. There's also Nobilis - kinda - but that doesn't really have a workable combat system at all so is probably entirely unsuitable. Erm... Last Exodus? You'd struggle to find a copy these days though. Or there's Suzeraine, not really angels but close. Supernatural maybe? I've not played it because I hate the Margaret Weiss base system, so I don't know how much they'll let you get way with in the way of non-human PCs.<br/><br/>To be honest, most of the games that include angels don't let you play one for the simple reason that they would be too overpowered. You might end up having to MacGuyver something out of a suitable system rather than finding a ready-made option. I'd suggest taking Exalted or BESM as a base system and changing the setting behind it.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262421/#Comment_262421" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T04:20:19+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  4:20AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2010 5:02AM by Cedric P.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Nomine can be very bad-ass action oriented.

In Nomine is a game where you can have a lot of fun with colors (wounds, surnatural flashy side effects of spending essence, divine interventions, etc).<br/><br/>SJ In Nomine received a lot of bad critics for not beeing the french In Nomine/Magna Veritas, but when I was at the university my group played a really fun action packed short campaign with it.

To whit: "Did you ever notice how in the Bible, whenever God needed to punish someone, or make an example, or whenever God needed a killing, he sent an angel? Did you ever wonder what a creature like that must be like? A whole existence spent praising your God, but always with one wing dipped in blood. Would you ever really want to see an angel?"<br/><br/>Angels are the army of God and therefore they are, in my interpretation of the Bible, soldiers.  They protect, they destroy, they are the tools of God to do God's business.  When the end comes, at least according to Revelation, they are the primary instrument of God's judgment.  That's badass.<br/><br/>And has been pointed out to me by a reader of this thread, the objection seems to be that somehow angels <i>aren't</i> badass, but then Joshua goes on to to talk about beings wielding "swords of revolving fire."  Maybe he's operating from a different definition of "badass" than I am, but <i>that's</i> badass.<br/><br/>Also, anyone who's taken the time to get to know me also knows I don't like wave my bona fides around, but I'm a Jewish historian by training, so the Old Testament has largely been "my" book in terms of study.  I dislike being accused of trivializing something when I'm not, or further being told that I can't be bothered to look things up when I have.  This is a forum about playing games and games are supposed to be fun.  I think the concept of badass angels versus badass demons in a world of badassery is fun.

Not only is it a d20 system, it's a d20 system from very early on in the d20 boom, when many untested and generally bad ideas made their way into print from people who should have known better. It really is not a very good adaptation of the d20 system. Although the power concepts are really cool (all White Wolf games, even the translations, have this advantage) and the setting and character ideas are really quite stylish (and easily adaptable to be actual angels instead of what they are, ahem), it really isn't that great.<br/><br/>The original tarot-card based system, as amazing as that sounds, was also translated and is still probably available as a free download somewhere, and really, it's not much better. It has the Everway style of "pull a card, now interpret it to see what happens, welp, good luck with that" sort of rules, which is not much in the way of guidance or game.<br/><br/>I own pretty much all of Engel and lurve it, but it never found its feet as a game.<br/><br/>Spite is the suggestion so far that is flat brilliant, I had never thought of Spite before, now I need to get it out and look at it because, wow, that might just be the home run in this thread.  Kudos.<br/><br/>I think Burning Wheel in general might be a good fit, I would keep away from the blow-by-blow combat system for everything except combat betwen divine beings in order to keep being badass, but the Beliefs thing really is a great idea for this. In fact, you might bump up Beliefs a bit to make chasing them even more powerful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269264/#Comment_269264" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T04:46:56+00:00" title="April 28, 2010  4:46AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you looked at Children of Fire?  <a href="http://www.mimgames.com/cof/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mimgames.com/cof/</a>  It's very well researched and the angels are badass (as they should be), on the order of Nobilis.
