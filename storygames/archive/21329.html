For example, if a player were to draw courage from a relationship with a loved one, then this mechanic would draw that element<br/>further into game play -- perhaps by putting that loved one at risk. My rough idea is that these character aspects could be written on index cards. Whenever the aspect is invoked for some mechanical or narrative advantage, a token is placed on that card. Those tokens can later be spent by the opposition (maybe a GM but not necessarily) to threaten that aspect or otherwise cause some dramatic conflict with aspect. (I got the token idea from Trouble for Hire, although that's not how that game uses tokens.) The hope is that this mechanic would send a super clear signal that the player is interested in this aspect and that other players/the GM should focus on it too. Aspects in Fate do this to some degree, but there is no explicit feedback loop whereby the player's in-game actions make it more likely for that element to be invoked. Are there any games that already do something like this? Is this even a desirable design goal?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467037/#Comment_467037" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-16T03:28:13+00:00" title="October 16, 2017  3:28AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this.  Besides emphasizing desired foci of the unfolding story it seems to me that it creates the kind of dramatic tension that robin laws "drama system" is also shooting for.  Getting what you want also tends to open up what your character cares about to further turmoil...

I think I've also seen this somewhere else, though I can't put a finger on where. <br/><br/>Your idea of making it a more visual signalling looks more solid though. Only playtesting will be able to determine how solid. One recommendation: make it the core mechanic and try not to throw too many other mechanics along with it, no matter how cool they are. The more mechanics a game has, the slower it turns out to be at the table.<br/><br/>I think this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU" rel="nofollow">Tabletop video of Fate core</a> may help you visualize how it could look at the table; at least it's one of the reasons why I think your mechanic looks solid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467050/#Comment_467050" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-16T18:49:58+00:00" title="October 16, 2017  6:49PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2017 7:18PM by DeReel.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your game is about tokens or dice pools, The same way you can "give a die to help" or "give a token to show appreciation", you can "give a die/token to show appreciation VIA a story element". So I place the die/token on the table saying "this is for your investigator"s relation with her ex. I'd like to hear more about it. If you invoke it later on, you'll get the die". The causal effect can be loose : I prefer no justification and a good story than a convoluted justification which makes the story meh. One die at a time, but the same player could have multiple dice queueing.<br/><br/>If you have no token or dice pool, adding a mechanism specially for that is a problem.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MisterS" title="MisterS"><img alt="MisterS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MisterS">MisterS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467059/#Comment_467059" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T02:03:28+00:00" title="October 17, 2017  2:03AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the encouraging words, Davey!<br/><br/>Rafu, I've been playing around with different mechanics with a kids on bike setting (think: Papergirls, Stranger Things) in mind. Game play would divide into three categories: solving mysteries (probably using a mechanic similar to Lovecraftesque), interpersonal drama, and action-adventure. I hadn't considered adapting regular Fate rules. I'll have to think about that...<br/><br/>Warrior Monk, you make a good point about keeping it simple! This mechanic would probably take up a lot of player attention &amp; energy, so I agree that it would have to be at the heart of the system.<br/><br/>DeReel, I think you are suggesting a different but possibly complimentary type of feedback mechanism, yes? I think both ideas are compatible and could create an interesting token economy that would hopefully support interesting storytelling. And I agree that this token economy is probably most compatible with some sort of dice pool resolution. (I've always been tempted to play around with an Otherkind dice system...)<br/><br/>Thanks everyone for your insights! I'll report back if I make any progress!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467066/#Comment_467066" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T08:20:57+00:00" title="October 17, 2017  8:20AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/MisterS" rel="nofollow">MisterS</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Game play would divide into three categories: solving mysteries (probably using a mechanic similar to Lovecraftesque), interpersonal drama, and action-adventure.</p></div></blockquote>\nOK, I see it now! I do believe solving mysteries &amp; interpersonal drama can fit oddly well together, supplementing each other, especially when they work in parallel, differently sized arcs... Like how, in a TV series, you might have a mystery-of-the-week while interpersonal drama develops over the whole season. The addition of "action-adventure" makes me think of something like a cop show.<br/>Now, for an episodic structure, I'd suggest not actually "cashing in" the opposition tokens over the same episode/session, but rather to use them as the base building block for developing future sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467148/#Comment_467148" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-21T05:31:38+00:00" title="October 21, 2017  5:31AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does this game involve a GM who does some prep?<br/><br/>In that case, I'd love to see a game where using stuff on your character sheet (which will be things like relationships or values, themes, etc) creates a menu of options for the GM.<br/><br/>For example, maybe each time I use a Love theme, I draw from a deck of cards and I give the GM a card from the Hearts suit.<br/><br/>To prep for the next session, the GM uses the hand of cards she accumulates (maybe cross-referencing it with a table of values or other oracle). The game is set up so that it throws a clear set of prompts to the GM, and then some reward system so that hitting all the right notes creates an appropriate reward. <br/><br/>The GM got the Eight of Hearts, which refers to "someone has a change of heart" on the chart, and is connected to the character's Bride-to-Be. So, the GM now has to work that in to the next session. However, another player used an Ace of Spades, which refers to "a sudden death", and is connected to his "Spies have infiltrated the government" theme. This means a government official is found dead. Perhaps the rules also tell us which of these are connected to each other.<br/><br/>Either way, the use of traits or aspects creates a grab-bag of stuff for the GM to use to prepare the next session, and then rewards her (or the whole group) for doing so.<br/><br/>Over time, some aspects will be ignored while others move into the spotlight more and more since "both sides of the table" are trying to work them in.<br/><br/>A much simpler variation which I've seen to effect is that each time you use an aspect (or whatever), it increases by 1. This naturally means players are going to prioritize those in play. That can be effective, with the right design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
