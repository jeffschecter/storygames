I'm looking for commentary, critiques and suggestions for improving my game. It straddles OSR and games typically discussed here, primarily since I referenced different versions of Runequest for combat (and tried combining them) and Trollbabe for a lot of other stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nI chose Trollbabe because I thought one on one was a great bridge for neophyte GMs like myself, and the game asks for more prep than TB, but significantly less than writing out a whole module.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for looking.<br/>\nScott                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362603/#Comment_362603" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T11:27:45+00:00" title="February 25, 2012 11:27AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've skimmed this, and it looks interesting.  It's also an odd mix of tone and tools.  For instance, it seems to be a "magic is evil" type setting, where, nonetheless, most characters have a reasonable skill at magic.  This made more sense in Trollbabe's setting, since Trollbabes were by nature special.  Maybe most magic is actually ancient technology?  It also seems to combine a setting that's going to be heavily about combat with extremely lethal combat.  Maybe a more cinematic combat system would make more sense?  Also, all those neat GM tools for creating situation aren't going to be very useful if the characters all die right away.<br/><br/>Have you played this yet?  If so, how did it work in practice?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skatay" title="skatay"><img alt="skatay" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skatay">skatay</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362684/#Comment_362684" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T08:50:53+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  8:50AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2012 9:24AM by skatay.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Peter!<br/><br/>The combat engine is probably the best part of the initial draw of the game, at least in that it was all the game had when it was a 1 page RPG. I've playtested it here: <br/><a href="http://redbox.wikidot.com/forum/t-284340/doomquest-first-run-playtest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://redbox.wikidot.com/forum/t-284340/doomquest-first-run-playtest</a><br/><a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/the-doom-quest-of-nightfang/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/the-doom-quest-of-nightfang/</a><br/><br/>The newer version of the game has some new untried wrinkles. Abstract range, new inventory system, etc..<br/><br/>You have some good points, if I'm reading them correctly: Trollbabe is the way it is to protect the character and get some epic-storyness going on. RQ combat is even more visceral and lethal than D&amp;D. Are the two a bad fit? I'm not sure. <br/><br/>I'm also hoping that the new GM will take to this system as a step towards the improv of Trollbabe. I wanted to shift the game slightly away from that, because, well, that kind of improv seems ridiculously hard for me.<br/><br/>The scenario creation is the only meat I have on the game so far. I don't plan (or want) to offer monsters, I'd rather let DMs make up their own. I mean, make 3 sides who want the stakes, create some lairs made of keywords, throw some other keywords down as well.... I'm unsure how much prep this really entails. I have to see if I can do this with players breathing down my neck.<br/><br/>Combat is lethal, but, as a RQ player, I learned (through dying) things like: Don't get into melee. This means talking, missiles, running, ambushing, etc. In this way, I think I can say the middle stat guy who has high social could shine, the high sorcery guy could shine as he could scare off high melee guys, who are very vulnerable.  <br/><br/>Thank you again for reading. <br/><br/>Here's a cover. I'm working on doing an alternate cover and switching them off as front/back if I ever do PoD. <br/><img alt="image" src="http://i925.photobucket.com/albums/ad96/skatay/doomquestcover2.jpg"/><br/><br/>Scott                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skatay" title="skatay"><img alt="skatay" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skatay">skatay</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365703/#Comment_365703" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T12:28:38+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 12:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            uploaded a revised version of the playtest documents:<br/><br/><a href="http://ridiculossus.blogspot.com/2012/03/new-playtest-documents.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ridiculossus.blogspot.com/2012/03/new-playtest-documents.html</a><br/><br/>new stuff :<br/>parlay option to talk your way out of combat<br/>charts and charts of basic items/starting money<br/>aimed social blows<br/>and tons and tons of revisions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365708/#Comment_365708" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T12:46:14+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 12:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm intrigued.

Why did I pick factorial? I just wanted prices to ramp up so great armor could be rare, or something worth finally saving up enough for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
