I began by trying to run a quick example game, to let me get a hang of the rules before adapting them for my purposes.  However, I got confused right away with some stuff and quickly tossed my example map for the real one, since the first one wasn't working for me. I'm gonna try to keep a running record of the frustrations I'm having, in the hope that 1) other folks have suggestions, 2) Tony find the feedback useful, and/or 3) other folks can avoid some of the same frustrations.<br/><br/>On my original map, I threw down some mithril, some caves, and an underground river.  My underground river started at 2 and then, due to funky rolling, zigzaged up and down before dropping in a steep waterfall off the bottom right corner of the page.  However, then I moved on to the Dwarves and drew a vein of gold ore from 3 to 6.  And this led to my first frustration, because -- when I looked for a place to have the Dwarves mine into the gold vein -- there wasn't a place where they could get to the ore without hitting the underground river.  It made sense to me that something cool should happen when they hit the river, but from reading the advanced rules on A4, I couldn't figure out what made sense. Maybe it creates a lake on the surface, but wouldn't it kill off all the Dwarves before they can even mine any gold? That would be a pretty lame Age of Civilization.<br/><br/>Then, when I got to the Dwarves actually building their civilization, the wording of how resources are managed season-to-season really baffled me.  The first turn seems to be Spring, but it looks as if you skip that the first time through, since there is no ore to gather.  That's a bit counter-intuitive, skipping the first stage, so you might want to mention that specifically. Then there's this business with mining, placing ore tokens on the newly created mines, and then "gathering the tokens up" and building new chambers to store the ore in.  Honestly, looking at my map, I was never sure which ore tokens had been generated through mining and which ones had been already moved to storage.  There's this thing where you have "active" and "inactive" white tokens in play at the same time, one of which you have to move around and the other which is immobile, and that's really confusing. Also, the way this whole process is described took me multiple readings and I'm still not 100% sure I understand it.  It seems to me that there's a lot of moving loot tokens around the board that ultimately proves meaningless, since the majority are simply removed when the Age ends.  Seems like once loot generates a storeroom and a settlement room, it should leave the board, so the (1) stored loot isn't confused with the (2) newly mined loot, or the (3) Dwarven Treasures, or (4) entombed loot, which is apparently treated exactly like Dwarven Treasure but isn't called such for some reason. All told, that's 4 different kinds of loot, all present at the same time, all represented by 1 kind of token.  How have folks kept them separate?<br/><br/>More thoughts and questions to follow, as I run the Age of Monsters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232382/#Comment_232382" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T22:41:41+00:00" title="September 14, 2009 10:41PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2009 10:49PM by J_Walton.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trying to set up the Surface Dwellers now.

Or does that count as the first year and I roll for a possible 5th monster group before starting "play" of this Age?

From the "Do X, Get Y" tone of the text, I had assumed, apparently like Hans, that you were meant to approach it as a kind of one-player Euro-style board game, with various groups having their little resources pools that they traded back and forth based on certain criteria.  If it's supposed to be a lot looser than that, with plenty of judgement calls and making things up, I can do that too, but being new to the game I was worried about how far I could stretch it without invalidating the guidelines entirely.<br/><br/>Like, if I want to play the game fast and loose, I can just mentally replace the detailed mechanics with stuff like:<br/><br/><i>BREEDERS: These monsters grow in number every season and must continue to accumulate resources in order to maintain their growth.  They generally do this by attacking nearby enemies, preferrably weaker ones.  So MAKE THEM DO THAT.

I wish I'd realized sooner that some people would approach it that way because it can quickly lead to disaster. That's probably at the root of the problems you're having.<br/><br/>Practically speaking, you'll get the best results out of How to Host a Dungeon by stepping through the procedures step-by-step without worrying about what the game's trying to do on a higher level. At each step in the procedure, do what you think is the most sensible interpretation of the rule in your current situation.<br/><br/>Sometimes you'll hit a rule that just doesn't seem to apply, like being told to gather ore when there's not ore to gather. Don't let it rattle you. I solemnly swear that the day will come when you suddenly discover that a mundane rule you were ignoring suddenly applies in a surprising way in a new situation.<br/><br/>And because the game is so bizarre and analog, you'll run into situations that are completely unpredictable (like the gold being all under the river, which has never happened to me). Again, interpret it in the way that makes sense to you. It's reasonable to ignore a terrain feature that outright spoils the game. I saw one dungeon where the civilization died out really early, so the player just started another one.<br/><br/>With the ore in the age of civilization, there should normally only be one bit of recently mined ore at any given time (except in a few odd circumstances). The Dwarves will dig it out in the spring, then move it into storage later, making a new room for it. It does seem weird to mine treasure that's only going to disappear later, but I'd advise following the procedure anyway for a number of reasons; it gives you an intuitive view of how wealthy the Dwarves are at each point, and of what their rooms are being used for, and it can matter later if you decide to try running two civilizations at once.<br/><br/>I hope you'll give the game another try and hopefully enjoy it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232664/#Comment_232664" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T13:42:54+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  1:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2009 1:49PM by J_Walton.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciate your response, Tony.  If it seems to be a common problem, I'm surprised it didn't show up in outside playtesting, but at least it's a known thing now that you can post warnings about.<br/><br/>I feel like I was trying to follow the rules procedurally, one step at a time, and, actually, it was not being able to see the bigger picture at all that was my main difficulty.  When I wasn't sure what you were trying to accomplish with a specific rule or set of rules, it was harder for me to feel comfortable riffing on it or changing it or ditching it entirely, because I didn't know how that rule was connected to the rest of the game.  Like, if you read my description of Breeders above, it tells me what they're like and what they generally do, which is a lot easier for me to parse than "Seize Loot, Add 1 Population, Expand ZOC, Check Support, Attack Weakest Neighbor." Honestly, even those bullet points would be easier to parse than five paragraphs of unformatted text, because it would allow me to quickly compare the Breeder behaviors to the other monster types to get a sense of their character.  If I end up playing again, which I hope to, I'll probably outline each Age before playing through it, making a step-by-step list of things to check off, because consulting the rules during play is a bit daunting.<br/><br/>P.S. It's interesting that you call the game "bizarre."  It didn't seem that way at all to me, because I looked at it and assumed, "Oh, hey, it's a turn-based strategy game, just with one player controlling multiple factions!"  And because I had that established idiom for interpreting it, I just trucked right along and wasn't phased at all until I started encountering difficulties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232665/#Comment_232665" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T13:46:57+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  1:46PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>making a step-by-step list of things to check off, because consulting the rules during play is a bit daunting.</blockquote>(This is the sound of someone giving you a great idea for a supplement or for the next edition.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232668/#Comment_232668" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T13:52:20+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  1:52PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I looked this up because I needed to be sure, but this is actually in the game already.

I guess I felt like I didn't have enough context to know what was a reasonable judgment call to make.  If I killed off civilization in a giant flood before it could get started, would that invalidate the rest of the game? I had no idea.  Did you need to have rooms built in your dungeon so the monsters would have some place to live? Would the dungeon have treasure if nobody put it there?  What was the Age of Civilization supposed to accomplish as far as map-building goes?  In the text it says: "In this age, a great civilization appears in the dungeon, prospering for a number of years and then ending." So flooding the Dwarves seemed like a no-go. Which is why I tossed my first map and started over.

HTHAD is a sandbox, and sandbox play can be ruined by providing too much guidance. I'm always trying to refine the line between too much and too little. I think saying it was a design choice must be worth another square in <b>mediocre play experience discussion bingo</b>, right?<br/><br/>In my experience, it's pretty hard to "ruin" a game of How to Host a Dungeon.
