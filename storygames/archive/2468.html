                    Hi all.  I have a friend who wants to open a board-game/coffee shop where people can hang out and try new games.  (With a her newborn daughter and a recent job-change, it's just a dream for now.)  Her goals are to create a local gaming community and proselytize the goodness of Euro-style games, etc. to people that equate tabletop games with Milton-Bradley and the like.  Wouldn't it be great if she included some indie rpgs on her store shelves, too?<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, I have a few questions to pose to the group:<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen indie or "story-game" style rpgs on the shelves of a brick-and-mortar store?  If so, what kind of store was it?<br/>
<br/>
Short of an indie-game boutique, what kind of store do you think would make the best venue for indie game retail?                </div>

<a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a> and <a href="http://www.key20.com/home.php" rel="nofollow">Key 20</a> sell a lot of indie games to game stores, including a few in my area.  Like any product, the staff and/or a dedicated customer base needs to have a good knowledge of indie games (what they are, who would like them, how to make recommendations, how to demo them, etc.) for them to sell in large numbers.  They'll sell in okay numbers just by themselves, right off the shelf, though.                        </div>

                            Wow, it seems like a brutal field of business to me, but I'll give you my experience.  There are two stores in my area that heavily stock indie RPG's.  One of them has a big fat stack of <i>Dictionary of Mu</i> that blows me away every time I go there.  Both of them are pretty diversified -- one sells a ton of comics, and has lots of folks who get comics and games set aside as they come out, and the other sells a ton of other games, including all sorts of European-style games and card games and poker stuff and so on.  Both are pretty aggressively geeky (in the sense of when I go there, there's often somebody having a loud conversation about game metaplot or their favorite comics) but clean and pleasant to go to.  Both are in somewhat alternative areas of town that get a lot of foot traffic.  <br/><br/>I don't know either owner well enough to know how business is going, but both stores have been around a long time.  <br/><br/>I'd love to buy my games at a cool independent bookstore with a cafe in the back, but I've never seen such a thing.  I suspect you have to go where the game-buyers are.                        </div>

                            In one of the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=4223.0" rel="nofollow">Infamous 5</a> articles over at the Forge, Ron mentions the indie comic store, <a href="http://www.page45.couk.com/P45main.html" rel="nofollow">Page45</a> in Nottingham, and it's approach to "mainstream" comics, and how that might apply to "mainstream" games (I've put mainstream in inverted commas, and you'll see why if you read Ron's article). <br/><br/>Page45 is actually my local comic store and whenever I go in there i like to imagine running a game store on the same principles - laidback, open, selling games as just another type of mainstream entertainment, not anything cliquey or exclusive or specialised. A nice, open store with comfy chairs and maybe a cafe and lots of interesting looking books and games would be ideal, imho at least. One day maybe I'll put my money where my mouth is!                        </div>

                            Jon's pretty much right, in that an educated and enthusiastic staff will sell more books than when they just sit on the shelf. That's a general thing.<br/><br/>I've worked at a full-on games store, and I've been spending a good deal of time in another one over the last couple of months, so here's some observations from that perspective. <br/><br/>I think what we see in "traditional" game stores is that part of the customer base is fairly ossified - there's a solid core of customers, who tend to be in the older gaming demographic (late-30s through late 40s, maybe?), and who know what they want. They come in to buy the latest WotC or WW release, or fill out a Warhammer unit, and they may not even browse what else is on the shelf.<br/><br/>The other big part of the customer base is younger (sometimes very young) kids, like elementary and middle-school age, who play whatever CCG is big at the time. They come in with their parents, who in general are not interested in gaming, by booster packs, and many of them play in instore tournament events. My sense (from when I sold a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh), is that there's a lot of individual turnover, but the general sales level for the product overall is fairly constant over the medium-term. <br/><br/>So, again talking about a "traditional" games store (which is a preface to what I actually want to talk about, I'm getting there!), the customer base for Indie games tends to be people going to the store to get those games, people who set up events at the store in order to raise awareness and their audience, "hardcore" customers companions who browse and see something interesting, and some "hardcore" customers who have something catch their eye, and are either curious in general, or are burned out on their game of choice (I think Burning Wheel does a good job with this demographic).<br/><br/>All of which is to say that the "traditional" games store is not, I think, a good model for supporting indie games sales. Now, it sounds like your friend is interested in developing a community of <i>play</i> around her store. This is exactly how indie games would fit into that business model. Many of them can be played out to satisfaction in one night, and there is such a breadth of genre and game focus that an educated sales staff could tailor game events to the mix of people who show up to them.<br/><br/>Personally, I would imagine that having an organized actual play system in place, run by either store employees or dedicated volunteers who are familiar with and educated (and passionate!) about the games, would be the best and most sustainable way to include indie games in the kind of store you outline above. Think about having "theme" nights that link board games and story games by genre or theme, where the store offers (say) Shadow Over Camelot and Paladin; or Arkham Horror and Conspiracy of Shadows; or the Lord of the Rings board game and a Burning Wheel LotR scenario.<br/><br/>Whew. I hope there's some food for thought in there....                        </div>

<p>I sell about half as many games through stores as online. I have it on good authority that Polaris and The Mountain Witch sell about the same as online. They're a year older than Shock: and were selling about like Shock: does a year ago.</p>
<p>What that means for me is that a certain number of books go out that otherwise wouldn't have that still get me a percentage. It's therefore useful <em>when selling though IPR</em> to have games in stores.  Distributors, near as I can tell, will fuck you sideways six way to Tuesday and then tell stores that they're out of stock.</p>
<p>So, given that this kind of thing is a viable business model at the retail end, I can see it being a viable outlet for IPR sales. Building actual culture around our games is what sells them. Nothing is a substitute for real enthusiasm, and having a place to be enthusiastic about something <em>right there on the shelf</em> that I can buy <em>right now</em> is probably an experiment worth pursuing.</p>
<p>I say this from my own, totally biased standpoint, that I want more people to play my games, and it benefits every mutualist one of us when someone buys one, because they'll buy another one, too. But my biased view doesn't include a perspective as a retailer. I don't have any idea how (or even if) retail works.</p>

                            I picked up Universalis at Forbidden Planet in Newcastle a few years back. I was also in there a few weeks ago (I occasionally go up there as part of my job) and they had A/State on their shelves. I didn't notice any other "indie" product, but I was in a hurry to catch my train.<br/>
<br/>
Just off of the top of my head, do you need an actual store? The main thing appears to be generating a culture of indie play in your local area, and selling to it. Why not go the Ann Summers route, buy some stock and hold game parties? Even hiring a space for gaming events has got to be much cheaper than the costs involved in running a store.<br/>
<br/>
(Hmmm... perhaps you could do the Ann Summers stuff at the same time - now that would make for some interesting Actual Play reports.)<br/>
<br/>
I mention this because my partner runs a small clothing store, and that's a lot of expense - the advantage she has is that <i>lots</i> of people browse stores to buy clothes. Not so sure how many people browse for boardgames and roleplaying games.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doug Ruff</cite> Not so sure how many people browse for boardgames and roleplaying games.</blockquote>
Lots. The reason I move the volume of Story Games I do, aside from the emphasis I place on them at events and conventions, is the fact that for many they are intimidating to many traditional role players. They don't want to buy before they try, or at _least_ have a look at them. I don't think you know how many times I have been standing behind the counter and heard, "I had been thinking about buying (fill in the blank) online, but didn't want to before I actually looked through it."<br><br>It's even more prevalent for boardgames which cross over intot he mainstream more.<br><br>Ch<br>-EndGame                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yes. About half of my indie games books have been purchased at traditional retailers. The two main (to my mind) game stores in the Twin Cities stock a small selection of indie titles. I know <a href="http://www.sourcecandg.com/" rel="nofollow">The Source</a> actively seeks out and buys cool stuff at GenCon every year (read: Adept Press booth) to re-sell in their store.<br><br/><a href="http://www.dreamhavenbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">DreamHaven</a> (claim to fame: Neil Gaiman's favorite comic shop) seems like they probably would, except they've got some sort of gentlenerds' agreement to not compete with <a href="http://www.phoenixgamesonline.com/" rel="nofollow">Phoenix Games</a> (former site of the legendary "Little Tin Soldier") just across the street.<br/><br/>I'm a little surprised to have not ever seen indie games at <a href="http://www.unclehugo.com/prod/" rel="nofollow">Uncle Hugo's</a>, but books don't seem to fly off the shelves of their small RPG section, either.                        </br></div>

                            To follow up on what Larry said (since we haunt the same stores), I would say that The Source has decent-sized and well-diplayed, if somewhat whimsical, collection of indie stuff. For instance, no <i>Sorcerer</i> that I've ever seen, but they <i>do</i> have a game about the world of squirrels, the name of which I'm forgetting right now... But they also have titles like <i>Burning Wheel/Empires</i>, <i>Death's Door</i> and <i>Breaking the Ice</i>. Also, there's a large section of gaming tables, and the indieMN tribe has at least played <i>Donjon</i>, <i>DitV</i> and <i>Capes</i> there, occasionally attracting interest from others in the store with much loud whooping.<br/><br/>And it's a shame that Dreamhaven doesn't carry any rpgs because you're right, Larry--- they would be the perfect venue. Phoenix Games' selection of indie titles is pitifully small and is pretty much split between <i>Sorcerer</i> supplements and tiny oddball games I've never even heard of, all stuffed down in the corner of a bottom shelf.<br/><br/>Uncle Hugo's is, I think, unfortunately, dying a slow, slow, decaying death. And yeah, I mostly remember seeing d20 and Rifts in their leetle game section.<br/><br/>Aaron                        </div>

Leisure Games actively promotes indie games, to the extent of having a separate way of finding them on their website to make them more prominent.<br/><br/>Playin' Games in London also often has a fair few indie games, they treat them just like any other game pretty much.                        </div>

                            At least two of the gaming stores in Seattle, The Dreaming in the University District and Gary's Games in the Greenwood area, carry a good selection of indie games, including those ordered through IPR.  It's in fact very insidious because I noticed that I'm not the only one to lose willpower when seeing the coveted book within my fingers' reach.  I know both stores have sold out on such titles as <i>Faery's Tale, Polaris, Dictionary of Mu, the Shab al-Hiri Roach, The Mountain Witch, Burning Wheel, Hero's Banner, Agon, Cold City, Covenant, Conspiracy of Shadows, Lacuna, Mortal Coil, Nine Worlds, Truth &amp; Justice,</i> and more that I'm forgetting right now.                        </div>

                            Kesher,<br/><br/>The Source <i>does</i> always have Sorcerer! BUT, it's not over in that ghetto of "indie" stuff, it's on a dense spine-outwards (as opposed to cover-outwards) shelf with digest format products, such as BESM and Hero Wars (<i>sic!</i>) and such. Go stand in front of the bins for titles "A__" through about "D___" and turn around. (It's possible this has changed in the last year.)<br/><br/><br/>The above comment highlights one of the problems faced by indie titles once they <b>do</b> get into brick-and-mortar stores. I know in some trades, you have to <i>pay</i> retailers to get prime shelf placement.                        </div>

                            Well, it's great to see that they at least carry a <i>discontinued</i> indie product, for full price I'm sure. Yet another pitfall for those trying to get their feet wet in the indie ocean...<br/><br/>It does seem weird that they would place, for instance, <i>Sorcerer</i> in such a location. I mean, <i>Nine Worlds</i> is over in the "ghetto", but I suppose it has a spiral binding. So, that seems like a valid concern for the indie game publisher: is a certain type of binding, on one hand seen as "more professional", gonna get you spined on a crowded bookshelf, while publishing something with a staple or spiral binding might leave you cover-forward by default?<br/><br/>I guess you just go the <i>Burning Empires</i> route and make your product as thick as the yellow pages; if they put <i>that</i> on the bookshelf, the whole thing would collapse...<br/><br/>A.                        </div>

<p>... or you print your cover in such a startlingly bright color that it will be seen despite its being tucked in tight among the neighbors.</p>
<p>My basic feeling about being in stores is that, if they know how to sell stuff, great. If they don't, well, I still get a pretty good cut from them buying it; they can choose not to sell it if they like. I can print more.</p>

As Graham says, Leisure Games are one of three stores in the UK that I can say for certain stock (using my own product as an example) Cold City. LG stock it (alongside pretty much everything else IPR carries), Fanboy 3 in Manchester have it but the store I know of that has shifted the most is my local FLGS, Black Lion in Edinburgh. The store has got through about 30 copies of CC, which isn't bad for a local shop selling a small-press product. Being a local boy kind of helps.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>
