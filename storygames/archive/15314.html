Your character is determined to make it, no matter what the cost.<br/>Key of Terror - "Oh sweet Jesus, help me!"  Refusing to help because you are afraid, even if it might get someone killed. <br/>Key of Trust - Through everything that's happened, the one thing you can still depend on is each other.<br/>Key of Wishful Thinking - "They're still people. Maybe we can help them."<br/>Key of Obsession - "I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s infected, I won\u2019t abandon a God-damned child!"<br/>Key of Overconfidence - "Nuthin' I can't handle." For going into a situation with no plan or precaution.<br/>Key of Indifference - "Face facts, people - not everybody here is going to make it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347777/#Comment_347777" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T14:10:17+00:00" title="November  3, 2011  2:10PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a big difference between movies, novels and TV shows in terms of how to organize milestones or keys.

So, they're sort of motivational in that they need to be cool enough that a player will want to use enough moves to take one, but they also help with plot direction as the game is GMless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347810/#Comment_347810" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T18:37:46+00:00" title="November  3, 2011  6:37PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consumerist frenzy - loot some cool stuff and live the high life for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347834/#Comment_347834" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T04:16:54+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  4:16AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning bridges, can't go back <i>that</i> way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347841/#Comment_347841" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T07:21:45+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  7:21AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The day your nice, safe bunker runs out of food.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347868/#Comment_347868" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T11:29:50+00:00" title="November  4, 2011 11:29AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to revisit a point that's already been touched on - the one where someone you care about is a zombie.<br/><br/>I think the really crucial part is the moment when you regroup from an attack, achieve a bit of rest (because you've killed the last one in immediate view, or sealed off the big heavy door, or something like that), and then you discover that the person you care about has a bite wound.

This isn't a genre about personal growth, about becoming the man or woman you were meant to be, about finding a safe place (though it is about trying to find one, in part, trying and failing).<br/><br/>This is a genre about pointless, and frequently random and undeserved, death. It's a genre about there being no safe place. It's a genre which typically implies (if it doesn't outright state) that this is our extinction event. The survivors are temporary. They're the nerve impulses still flickering through our corpse. <br/><br/>I can't think of a single major (or indeed minor) zombie movie in which the characters establish some new hope. At best a handful escape to an uncertain future.<br/><br/>Some of the suggestions are good though. With some repetition from above:<br/><br/>First kill, as Jason said.<br/><br/>First kill of someone you know.<br/><br/>First loss of someone you care deeply about.<br/><br/>First sight of the new ruined world (the camera pans back revealing devastation, corpses and burning buildings).<br/><br/>Running out of food/fuel/water and having to take a hearstopping risk because of it.<br/><br/>First time you let someone down and they die.<br/><br/>Rob's one. First time you deal with someone alive who's infected. <br/><br/>Rob's other (he's on a roll). First time you have to deal with someone alive who's a liability to your group. What do you do?<br/><br/>Also, choices. Rob's are good because they involve choices. Ted's bitten. You like Ted, but he's going to turn. What do you do?<br/><br/>Four new survivors just showed up, but one has a fever and they're not willing to let you inspect them. What do you do?<br/><br/>Bob's an asshole, but he's become more than that. He's hoarding food and you just found out he'd been stealing from the central supplies your group has stashed. What do you do?<br/><br/>Mary's pregnant. What do you do?<br/><br/>Clara's got a life threatening illness which is easily treatable with meds. Which are in any major hospital. Where the dead are. What are you going to do?<br/><br/>Choices. The genre is about slow decline and the terrible choices made along the way.<br/><br/>Also, Felan's is a key scene. No real choices there but it is a common feature to these things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347888/#Comment_347888" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T15:04:16+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  3:04PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Just to revisit a point that's already been touched on - the one where someone you care about is a zombie.<br/><br/>I think the really crucial part is the moment when you regroup from an attack, achieve a bit of rest (because you've killed the last one in immediate view, or sealed off the big heavy door, or something like that), and then you discover that the person you care about has a bite wound.

I'm not exactly sure how to make that happen with this game, but somehow it must fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347890/#Comment_347890" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T15:12:23+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  3:12PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>If I had to characterise the genre in one word that word would be bleak.

I'm not challenging here, just trying to explore. What kind of personal growth are you thinking of? I'm not saying it's not there, just that right now I'm struggling to picture it and if I can I may be able to be more useful.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of zombie movies. Far, far too many. On which note, if you've not seen the movie The Dead check it out. Also, if you've not seen the indie game also titled The Dead (but no relation to the film of that name) check that out too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348044/#Comment_348044" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T21:04:34+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  9:04PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>What kind of personal growth are you thinking of?</blockquote>\nMaybe something like this: personal growth is a character learning that he was capable of something, good or bad, that he didn't know he was capable of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla" title="Sodzilla"><img alt="Sodzilla" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla">Sodzilla</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348053/#Comment_348053" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T23:57:17+00:00" title="November  5, 2011 11:57PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd argue that those little growth moments are far from meaningless.
