Are rulebooks detailed enough about this point? I mean, probably by now you can do this drunk with one hand on your back and no prep but be honest: Did you learned how to do this right just by reading one book, by GMing one session? Or did it took you a whole campaign as a player with an experienced GM to understand how it was meant to be done and the possibilities it had? <br/><br/>Even if you're actually a complete natural genius, didn't you find examples of play more clarifying than actual rules? Did you ever noticed there was something in those examples that the rules didn't tell you at all? Probably something about how NPCs are designed and presented, how to frame scenes and improvise, why you should be paying attention to your players input...<br/><br/>Whenever I point at this everybody starts saying that' something GMs must learn by themselves, that they should google for advice or ask another GMs. I don't agree. I believe designers still think <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16115&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow"> Techniques.</a> aren't a part of rulebooks but something each group of players must come up with from out of experience with previous games. Well, what if yours is the first RPG they have ever readed?. Where would they get the techniques from?<br/><br/>I do like that a few indie designs are actually including more and more advice on good GMing. I like a lot how in AW the basic ones are described as Commandments. Yet I'm wondering why while players got rules and must abide by them, GMs have none and the right of rendering player's innefective whenever they feel like it. And a lot of the guidelines they actually need for doing it right must come from a lot of experience, which can or cannot be misguided by previous experiences with games that have nothing to do with the way you intend your game to be played.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367620/#Comment_367620" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T13:56:40+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  1:56PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>But as a GM you've got to build a world, populate it with characters and come up with an story hook, frame scenes, provide challenges more or less according with the capabilities of the group... how do you actually learn how to do that?

Spycraft originated it, I believe.  There are several other GM systems out there that are fun.

The Cortex+ games have all had very solid guidelines on how to present challenges to players, how to use the PP economy to manage the flow, how to engage with the characters' flags, etc.<br/><br/>And, of course, many of the larger indie games of the past decade have been brilliant about this. And even some of the smaller ones.<br/><br/>I think giving really good directions for "how to run this game" has become more and more a central focus for rpg designers. <br/><br/>I think a big part of the "system matters" revolution is to realize that changing what the GM does in the game changes what the game is and what it isn't. So game texts in general are getting progressively better at defining what it is the GM is supposed to do in order to run the game. (With exceptions, I'm sure) <br/><br/>In other words, games tend to have more and more "rules" for GMs.<br/><br/>I think it's very possible that many GMs who've been at it for a while are more used to ignoring such rules than they are to following them. Which is another matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367687/#Comment_367687" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T17:22:29+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  5:22PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y134/alizee340/judgedredd_i-am-the-law.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367692/#Comment_367692" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T17:39:29+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  5:39PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>I think that the idea that the GM has no rules for how they do things, in particular that they can change things at whim, is an artifact of the late 80s / 90s games.</blockquote>\nActually even those games said you shouldn't change things according to your whim (for the most part.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367696/#Comment_367696" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T18:09:36+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  6:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Actually even those games said you shouldn't change things according to your whim (for the most part.)</blockquote>\nI was being a little snarky when I said "whim" I guess.<br/><br/>What they actually said was something to the effect of "change the rules or ignore the rolls if they produce unsatisfactory results". Or some other sort of Rule Zero type statement.<br/><br/>And more recent game texts have more consistently chosen not to include that sort of thing in them. They give guidelines/structures/rules for the GM to follow. They expect the GM to either follow them as written, or to negotiate other alternatives among the group and follow them. And they tend to include more than just "here's how you settle a conflict/combat". They tend to include guidelines on things like "here's how you initiate an interesting conflict" and "here's how you create a sense of rising action by making use of this clever mechanical trick we've included in the game" and things like that.<br/><br/>In other words, I think if you're playing a game from the last 10-15 years, and you've actually read all the GM advice/guidelines/techniques/etc and are following them, then chances are pretty good that you're following a relatively structured set of GM's rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367699/#Comment_367699" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T18:19:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  6:19PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>Yet I'm wondering why while players got rules and must abide by them, GMs have none and the right of rendering player's innefective whenever they feel like it.

But it's like saying that every gdr has to have an elf.  Every different game that call someone "GM" has different rules about what they do (I consider most of the "the GM is the God of the World" rules as applications of the same game, obviously. If you play in the same way, it's the same game)<br/>\n2) A lot of games with someone called "GM" or something like that HAVE strict rules about what he can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nNathan said uptread that tree games are not "a lot". OK, let's see how many he would call "a lot": Trollbabe, My Life With Master, Dogs in the Vineyard, Primetime Adventures,  S/Lay w/Me, Bliss Stage, Carry, Dust Devils, The Pool, Burning Empires, ,  etc...  I think it's easier to list the indie game WITHOUT rules for the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I don't see the premise of this thread at all.   It's better to give strict rules for the GM? Yes, obviously.

They have definitely evolved from the mistakes of the past, designers have been thinking over and over about why games don't work completely as they should, why people keep complaining about them and hacking them. They could have just said "it's a matter of taste" and cross their arms and stop listening. But they choosed to try and do something more fun and the public proved they were right.<br><br>I have learned a lot just by reading these awesome designs from the last years and I'm really thankful for that. I'm not addresing so much to the veteran innovative designers here but to every lurker with a dream of making their own hacked fantasy heartbreaker like me. If you think RPGs are ok the way they are or have a good idea of how can they evolve that's ok too.<br><br>Allow me to clarify that my opinion is just that, an opinion. I know it's not an absolute truth. The reason I started this topic is because I've got this doubt biting a corner of my brain. Doubts tend to lead to good places sometimes. <br><br>So, I doubt <i>some</i> ideas for games should be based on just giving advice to GMs instead of hard coded rules, since I think that they could have a different impact if they were actually called rules instead of "rules". I also wonder how would players react if they see that as they have rules to follow to keep the game flowing, the GM has another different set of rules that helps her achieve something from the game and keeps her (at least a little) from ruining the fun on the table. Not that a good GM would do that, but an unexperienced one could do it without the proper guidelines. And an abussive one would do if given the chance. (A total psycho would do it anyway, but in the worst case people will settle with an abussive GM instead. I've seen it happen, it's sorta' stockholm syndrome-thing)<br><br>The kind of GM rules I'm thinking of goes beyond balancing encounters (D&amp;D already does that) building the world (Burning wheel teached me that) how to avoid railroading (DitV showed me how cool was that) sharing GM duties and other problems indy games have solved in the past decade. Whatever design you make from now on definitely has to consider most of the advances made by these games, if not all.<br/><br/>However I can't help but have this feeling that 70% of the game designers are still thinking a game is only about mechanics that help convey a particular mood and forget there's about a 40% of the game that is about the Tecniques players apply to make use of those mechanics. Most of the time I don't find those Techniques explained in the rulesets, but given as  advice in forums, often written by frustrated players who finally guessed the way the game should work... which sometimes isn't even the way the designer meant the game to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>Perhaps your feeling is different, I'm just telling you about mine, which again isn't an absolute truth... but I can't help but feel like this.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367771/#Comment_367771" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T00:09:05+00:00" title="March 15, 2012 12:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2012 12:24AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of all the games listed upthread, I don't think <i>any</i> of them bind the GM up in the rules as thoroughly as <i>many</i> games bind the players up in the rules*.  It's common as a player to have to face rules-based hurdles in pursuit of a goal.  (That's close to the academic definition of a "game", BTW.)  But as a GM, what goal are you pursuing, and what rules govern that pursuit?  "Provide what the players need" is not gameplay.  It's free play, or being a stand-in for an interactive environment-generating program, or something.  <br/><br/>Sure, there are creative goals of play that unite players and GM, but these aren't usually expressed mechanically in the same way character goals are.<br/><br/>*As cool as Apocalypse World's MC agendas/principles/moves are, can you imagine playing that game <i>as a player</i> with only those, and no "roll high, get good results for your guy" rules?<br/><br/>On the topic of AW hacks, I will cite Murderous Ghosts as true rules-based GMing.

I live in a country where the public is almost unaware tabletops RPGs exist. But I have the means to introduce the hobby here (I publish comics but I can easily expand to publishing games). So finding a way to make games accesible to people without experience is my main worry. Making them rules-lite and GMless is a good start, but now I also see how teaching the techniques is crucial here, since there haven't been other games that could provide a background for that.<br/><br/>Yes I've got kids used to card games, computer RPGs and MMORPGs but they have never played anything that dealt with social mechanics other than soccer. So, without seeing how it's played or without reading enough examples of play they would still be clueless. And spreading the hobby by hand, person by person in conventions only, will take us forever, which is a poor and dangerous schedule for any publisher.<br/><br/>So probably I can't have them play even AW right now, but perhaps if we start with a couple simple games that could teach them about scene framing, dealing with other players input, improvising, etc. we could built it from there until they are ready for the major leagues.<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe basing the game on soccer wouldn't be such a bad idea... sort of LARPing with a ball for passing the spotlight and conflict resolution by doing tricks with the ball... hmmm...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367840/#Comment_367840" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T08:01:20+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  8:01AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paulo">@Paulo</a> <br/><br/>It looks like you are in the fantastic position of inventing story games in your country! <br/>You don't even need to explain what is different compared to previous RPGs.<br/><br/>Sounds exciting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367841/#Comment_367841" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T08:16:31+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  8:16AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>Hmm, maybe basing the game on soccer wouldn't be such a bad idea... sort of LARPing with a ball for passing the spotlight and conflict resolution by doing tricks with the ball... hmmm...</blockquote>\nThere recently was an RPG called Tools of Ignorance which was about baseball players.

In D&amp;D you simply can't say "If you don't want to play x style of game, do not play this game, no-one at the table should ever expect this" because it would be untrue.<br/><br/>-The necessity of giving the DM every tool possible to create a situation with plausible tactical/challenge depth means the conversation in a trad game goes like this:<br/><br/>DMG "Play fair"<br/>DM "Ok, what's fair in this situation I completely made up just now?"<br/>DMG "Wait, why did you make up a situation?"<br/>DM "Because I was given the responsibility to do that because being inserted into a situation they did not make up themselves that they can treat like a puzzle or mystery or challenge is what my players asked for."<br/>DMG "Oh, right, well...I've never thought of this specific situation before"<br/>DM "Then why did you give me the tools to do it?"<br/>DMG "Because this is a trad game and so it has, technically, tools to build any situation in medieval fake-europe, like a periodic table. That's the appeal"<br/>DM "I know. So what's fair in<i> this</i> specific situation"<br/>DMG "Still...ummmm..I don't know, depends on your group, their read on the scenario, what you can handle as a GM...ummm...how about you write to Dragon about it..."<br/>DM "Well fuck"<br/><br/>-The player comes to the table thinking basically this:<br/>"I can do nothing, except what is on the character sheet and what the rules say I can do"<br/>The GM comes to the table thinking basically this:<br/>"I can do everything, except what the rules say I can't do"<br/><br/>It is an inextricable part of the fact that trad games do not work the way players and GMs want them to unless the GM has the ability/responsibility to invent things (including physical laws, social customs and ethically complex situations) in any corner of the setting.<br/><br/>This, by necessity, opens the door to doing it wrong.<br/><br/>For example: One of the first wrong steps you often see is a GM buying a module and then trying to run the game like the module.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368462/#Comment_368462" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T10:30:06+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 10:30AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>It's not just advice, it's crucial for the game to work as it should.</blockquote>\nI don't understand this, isn't all advice "how to make this game work as [what the designer thinks] it should"?

They go into a lot more detail and give better examples (especially compared to the DMG 1). The DMG 2 actually has tons more advice on how to use its rules and what intentions were meant. A lot of that link is also advice which can't be converted into rules without still creating "bad" GMs or a lot of work. e.g. if the cardinal directions was a rule, then every GM would have to prepare for 6 adventures instead of 1 (or break the rules).  Good GMs would know when to break those rules, but inexperienced GMs might find it overwhelming and get turned off by the game, and experienced GMs might find it patronizing and overly hand-holding and get turned off by the game.<br/><br/>Advice can be supported by rules, but just make the mechanics define the role of the GM (and other players) with advice and examples on how to make the experience great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368492/#Comment_368492" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T12:23:35+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 12:23PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">look</span> read like the kind of person that wouldn't take an advice unless you were actually looking for it.
