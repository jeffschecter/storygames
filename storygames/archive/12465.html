Kai was apathetic;  Baz (after a little prodding) admitted the friend who was ambushed and torn limb-from-limb by an Ewok (we noticed the fuzzball planet could be either Kashyk or Endor depending on the player's choice) was in fact a droid they used to call Roger Roger - "I watched the light go out in his eyes."  <br/>\n<br/>\nKai and 22-B witnessed the brawl and shootout at the cantina;  22-B was there to spend time with M3PO, there on business, but they are actually 'regulars', frequently using the bar as a clandestine meeting place.  ("Sometimes we find a janitor's closet, a service corridor...")  After the unpleasantness, Kai immediately spirited Alya away to the safehouse he had prepared in case of emergency, because his old spy habits haven't died.  There was a very short "inspection" of the crime scene by the authorities - essentially, they cleaned up the bodies, trusted the Corsairs at their word, took "the Tarko boy" into custody, and started the hunt for Alya.  The way justice works on Boerlia, they don't need much in the way of 'investigation' and the owner of the bar was eager to see it making income again. So it was that mere hours later Baz (played by Rolfe), hearing the news about his son, showed up at the bar, clientele already back, minus a few fainthearted, plus a few gawkers and onlookers, looking for clues and information.  He humbly, meekly asked Mr. Ordo (played by Erik), whom everyone knew is a Rhodian spice smuggler --"I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner" -- if he witnessed any of the unpleasantness.<br/>\nMr. Ordo reminded Baz that he's a legitimate businessman--"I didn't mean to imply that you weren't", Baz said--and would have no reason to be around any kind of unpleasantness.<br/>\nBut Ordo had heard rumors from less savory associates: someone has contradicted the official report.  <br/>\n"That's shocking," Baz says.  <br/>\n"None of the locals were armed," Ordo continues.  He wouldn't put any credence in such a rumor, himself, but it's what he heard.  He goes back to his "dinner", a tall blue bubbly drink.<br/>\nKai returns to the bar at this point, Alya secure in his safehouse.  The bartender tells him one of the Corsairs -- the Regulator, the Arcano one -- has been asking questions about Alya.<br/>\nBaz notices the droid and asks Ordo if she witnessed the event.  Ordo shrugs "She's a regular.  It's weird.  Why would a droid hang out in a bar?  They don't serve their kind here."<br/>\n"Sometimes they get personalties," Baz says.  "I've seen it."<br/>\nBaz has some trouble getting up the courage to talk to the droid - everything he could say to her somehow sounds like a pickup line.  But then he thinks to himself, "This is my son, damn it," and speaks.  <br/>\n"Two-two-B?  Twentytwo-B?  Is that your name?  Is that what they call you?"<br/>\n"Yes."<br/>\nA conversation follows in which 22B is very terse, volunteering very little information beyond what's explicitly asked, but she does admit, yes, she witnessed.  Yes, she has some of it saved to a file.  Yes, the Tarko boy seems innocent.    Yes, she might be willing to share that data, as she sees it could hurt the provisional governor.<br/>\nThe Corsair regulator appears now, presumably to hunt down Kai.  Baz offers him a shaker of salt, a delicacy - nay, addiction - to the Arcano people.  (Rolfe says that's Star Wars canon.)  He enjoys it with his proboscis and says, "I'm listening...wait, aren't you are the father on the man who killed my friend."<br/>\nSuddenly, Kai "drunkenly" bumps into the Regulator.<br/>\n"What's your problem, Bothan?" the Regulator asks.<br/>\n"Too much alcohol," Kai claims, walking off with the Regulator's card key.<br/>\nBaz gives an impassioned plea to the Corsair - how will it look to the locals, what if it was your family, what good does another killing do?  The Corsair is un-moved, even angered - just one more killing might not be enough! -, but 22-B tapes the conversation:  the public will know, at least, that Baz tried to reason with them first.<br/>\n22B agrees to help Baz;  she can talk to the security cameras in the hallway out side the bar.  ("The security cameras in the bar are old and probably not even on.")  Baz goes to get her memory crystals to record the data onto.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Arcano tails Kai out of the bar, but he easily shakes the tail, and doubles back looking for Baz.<br/>\nKai tracks down Baz and interrupts his walk to acquire memory crystals in a secluded spot.  "Things are going to get worse before they get better."  He says that he, too, saw that Lur Tarko was framed.<br/>\nBaz punches his fist through plast-dobe.  Kai offers to help - Baz asks if he can acquire a couple innocuous chemicals.  <br/>\nKai knows those are two of the three ingedients for a bomb, and says so.<br/>\nBaz says he should have recognized the haunted look of an ex-stormtrooper.  "What unit did you serve with?"<br/>\nKai:  "It's not something I talk about.  Ever."<br/>\nKai and Baz split up to buy bomb ingredients.  Kai is careful, buying it at different stores, and using money so he won't be traced, but still he somehow raises a red flag.  The authorities put him on a list.  Baz is not so careful, and is also flagged...<br/>\n<br/>\nB, after talking to security cameras, discovers that Baz entered the cantina unarmed, but the Corsair Regulator did not.  She goes to tell Baz.  She says she might be able to get some dirt on the governor (not in those words) from her contact in his employ.  Maybe they can raise enough public support to have the governor removed.<br/>\nBaz agrees.  "If there's one thing I learned fighting those damn ewoks, it's that strength in numbers can topple even an empire."<br/>\n<br/>\nTarko and B leave memory crystals and notes with the damning information on the doorsteps of various news stations.  It's not long before there's a public protest, demanding the release of Tarko Jr.  The governor claims that the memory crystals are elaborate forgeries, but agrees to release Lur Tarko under house arrest.  A huge crowd is gathered when Lur is freed into the custody of his father.  (And, in the first draft, security guards trying to disperse the crowd ended up 'accidentally' hurting Baz, but Rolfe changed his mind later.  So, to me this felt strange: first Rolfe tried diplomacy and met with failure, and that diplomacy had no in-narrative consequences towards Baz's release;  then he built a thermal detonator, intended for a jailbreak, so we crossed off 3 squares, but then he didn't use it, and then he and B with their anonymous PR campaign won the day.  I could rationalize this as "we have made progress, we now know two ways that don't work" but Anton Chekov would be disappointed that they built a bomb which never detonated.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I think it was around here that Sarah said, "I don't know what time it is, but we still have a bunch of boxes to check off...I think we should be rolling a lot more."  We picked up the pace, and the narration lost detail.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, B meets M in one of their usual secluded places - <br/>\nM (played by Rolfe), in a monotone chip-voice: "B.  My sweet."<br/>\nM has had a rough day - B queries him to elaborate.<br/>\nM:  "You know how I hate processing death warrants.  4 were assigned for an entire family."  (Rolfe: can I change my 'hurt' to 'hunted'?  Jamie: of course.)<br/>\nB consoles him.<br/>\nM goes on about how he hates dealing with bounty hunters, how the order isn't for an official channel execution but is supposed to look like an accident;  therefore, no disintegrations.  "And the bounty hunter asked, 'Can they be a little disintegrated?'  As if I have the authority to make that decision."<br/>\nB cares so little about the fleshies and their ways that it doesn't occur to her that the family must be the Tarkos, but she does recognize this is the "dirt" she wants to get on the governor, so she talks M into letting her download the files, which she does.  (Paying nary a price.  We felt like the players were rolling significantly above average and the GM was rolling significantly below...)<br/>\nM:  "My database is your database."<br/>\n<br/>\n(Continued in comments because apparently my post is too long.

When the bounty hunter walks in in full helmet and armor, because drinking is something bounty hunters do--bounty hunting is thirsty work--he seizes the opportunity.  (Which Erik created in the first place.)  He poisons (and this wasn't even a retroactive "oh, did I never mention I carry poison with me?" - he mentioned checking his pouch of poison vials earlier in the game) the bounty hunters drink - a slow-acting knockout drug, and follows the bounty hunter until he drops, giving him the opportunity to drag the bounty hunter into an alley, steal the bounty hunter's clothing, go to the Corsair Regulator's apartment room under full view of the surveillance cameras, get in with his stolen key, and ventilate the Regulator with the bounty hunter's gun.  <br/>\n(As he's planning this, Jamie points out that according to the goal sheet, the Regulator isn't Kai's real problem, it's the Instigator.  The Regulator must just be the Instigator's stooge in this matter, but we decide to play through.)<br/>\nHe then ransacks the Regulator's room and finds a debt record that shows the dead Corsair owed significant money to the Regulator.  Motive is now established.  He also found a voice message from the Instigator begging the Regulator to see if he can track down "That Alya Bitch." (We decide later.)<br/>\nKai decides the Instigator is going down as well, and leaves the Regulator for dead.<br/>\nBut he's not dead (still has two boxes to check off), merely unconscious.<br/>\n<br/>\nA crowd of anti-republic sympathizers has now gathered at Tarko's farm in the swamp.  ("They said you were a fool for herding nerfs in a swamp" - Erik)  They're trying to talk Baz into leading a movement to remove the governor, but Baz, who can feel the crosshairs upon him, just wants to lie low or get off planet.  A friend says:  "You want to get four people off planet?  You might as well try killing the governor."  22-B arrives to share the information she gleaned from M;  Kai arrives to share the information he got from the Regulator.  They dialog just a moment - 22B is talking going public, Kai thinks that will end up with a lot of dead citizens - when a blaster shot hits the wall near Baz's head.<br/>\nIt's the leader of the Corsairs.  He still believes that Lur was the killer, having no knowledge of the dead Corsair's debt to the regulator.  The crowd screams and dives for cover, Baz pokes his head out the window and sees the Corsair captain approaching, screaming threats.  <br/>\nBaz:  "I'm going to give you 3 seconds to get off my swamp!"<br/>\nThe Corsair, of course, doesn't oblige.<br/>\nBaz:  "Emma, get my gun."<br/>\nA firefight ensues;  Kai ushers some bystanders out the back of the house, and then circles around to flank the captain.  Fire is exchanged, the captain is winged, but Baz's son has a gun of his own and comes out the front door, making himself a target!  Baz runs out after him and knocks him to the ground before he's blasted;  they both get hurt from the fall.<br/>\nThen the bounty hunter shows up, intent on killing Baz, but the captain has seen the security videos from the attempt on the Regulator and thinks the bounty hunter is in on it.  The captain opens fire on the bounty hunter, the bounty hunter opens fire on him.  The captain is pinned, the bounty hunter goes for cover...and Baz's wife, running out to protect her boy, gets shot (but not killed.)<br/>\nKai circles around behind the bounty hunter now, and uses his mimicry to escalate, as the bounty hunter's voice rings out "I'm going to get you, captain!"  The captain, completely focused on the bounty hunter now,  manages to kill him, but is vulnerable to a shot from Baz who finishes him off.  (3 rolls, all in all:  two by Baz with Kai cooperating, one by Kai with Baz cooperating.  We all dug how Erik introduced and used the bounty hunter NPC to push his own agenda.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scared civilians regroup in the farmhouse, knowing the authorities are on the way and they need to get out of there.  22B and Kai share their information and they, having seen the shootout, outraged, march on the governor's mansion, demanding his resignation.  (22B cashes in the 'Violence erupts.' special for this.)<br/>\nAt this point Baz wants to resort to violence.  "I've got a landspeeder.  I've got a bomb."<br/>\nKai talks reason into him - he thinks this is a great opportunity to force the governor's hand.  They make their way to the mansion and Kai spends the rest of his wealth bribing the security guards he knows in the governor's employ to leave.  The choice is easy;  leave and get paid, or face an angry mob?  They leave.  22B gets them past the electronic security, and using files she's downloaded from M directs them to the governor's office.  He's outraged, calls for the guards, but realizes he's in trouble.  At gunpoint, they demand he televise his resignation, admit his corruption, call for public elections, and leave the planet.  He agrees - he's a scheming politician, not the sort of villain who will get himself killed out of pride.<br/>\nAfter the broadcast, he orders M3PO to start packing up his things.  22B, enraged, intervenes.  "You don't understand, you don't have the right to take him with you."  She abandons her pacifism and zaps him;  he acquiesces, whimpering.  (4 successes on the roll, price pacifism obviously.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the power vacuum the Inquisitor steps in provisionally.  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  Kai knows the Corsairs still have to go down, so they go public with their knowledge of the Corsair infighting.  The Inquisitor, in a televised broadcast, agrees to drop the charges against Lur and investigate the Corsairs.  The Regulator, in a tank of bacta at the intensive care unit, sees the broadcast and gives up the ghost.  (Jamie suggested this without any buy-in from the group, but they didn't come up with anything else, so it stands.)  The Inquisitor adds that in the temporary government before the free elections, dissidents will be exposed, like, for example, "Lieutenant Tarko of the 324th Ivory Gundarm Battalion."  (Rolfe crosses off "I'm an honorable man".) That leaves the last Corsair, who wants to finish Alya off before he goes off-planet.  (This move won them three successes, which they decided to spread out on the regulator, the instigator and Alya, which made sense to me storywise but wasn't sure it was 'allowed'.  But I gave it to them without questioning.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe instigator has somehow found Kai's safehouse (just for drama, Jamie says) and Kai catches up with him, sneaks up on him from behind, touches his arm and immobilizes him with some kind of Bothan ninja martial arts move, and suggests he leave the planet immediately, that revenge is not worth it. "If you stay, you'll be staying under the ground."  The Instigator takes his advice and goes off world.  "I think our ship is repaired by now anyway."<br/>\n<br/>\nAlya is still wanted for questioning. (Erik says:  "What?  She's wanted by the law?"  Jamie's bad.)  <br/>\nSo Kai incites a crowd that demands the Instigator drop all charges from the unpleasantness before the new regime, with 22-B's help, (and after rolling 3 6's on 5 dice) the Inquisitor relents.   Alya is free.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes about a year under the Inquisitor's purview before democratic elections are held on the planet.  The lockdown is ended and people are allowed to emigrate off planet, which they do in droves.  Then Kai and Alya flee offworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaz's wife leaves him, unhappy about his past catching up with them and being shot.  (Rolfe narrated this epilogue even though he still had a box left on 'wife and kids')<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 22B always has a secret from M3PO - she can never admit to him that she downloaded and erased his record of the death warrants.  And under the Inquisitor's regime things got even worse for droid rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe End<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nSO!  For me, some of the best gaming I've seen ever, thanks to the mad skills of the players.  I contributed very little - this is all the genius of the players and Mark.  Sarah, Rolfe, and Erik were like, "Yeah, whatever, that's just how it is to game with us, you should just ditch that D&amp;D group you hang out with," but then where would I get the joy of waiting a whole hour between turns?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was not without its faults and rough patches, in particular it took us a while to get the characters together and cooperating because there were no in-game hooks for it.  Sarah stepped up and played a bit OOC to make it happen.  We had a host of constructive criticism for Mark which he says he'll get to IMMEDIATELY.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jamie                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280137/#Comment_280137" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T13:18:12+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  1:18PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Big thanks to you and everyone involved for the playtest!
