I have been furiously hacking Apocalypse World for my own Conan game (I have seen SimonC's 'World of Conan' too).<br/><br/>The sticking point I've had is coming up with a Weird move to replace, "Open your brain".<br/><br/>I have created a move called, "Swear an Oath". The character can swear an oath about some objective they are passionate about completing.<br/>examples:<br/><br/>"I'll varnish the floor with your brains!"<br/>"By Mitra, I won't let you die today!"<br/>"Bel's Balls, it won't slip through my fingers again!"<br/>"I'll dine with Crom the day a scurvy Barachan gets the best of me!"<br/><br/>Roll+Weird ('Wyrd' in my hack). On a 10+ hold 1+1. On a 7-9 hold 1. The  character may spend his hold in any effort to see his oath through. On a 10+ they are also invigorated by making the oath and get +1 forward now. On a miss they are mocked by the gods; take -1 forward and deduct an experience point, if any.<br/><br/>So... how is this move? Thoughts? Suggestions? Alternative ideas?<br/><br/>(It may be important to note that since there is no psychic maelstrom in the Hyborian age, I made Augury the same as the original 'Open your brain' move, but it is only available to Cultists, Sages, Sorcerers, and Witches).<br/><br/>Thanks                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335735/#Comment_335735" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T22:57:09+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 10:57PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's bad, per se, but it doesn't seem to occupy the same thematic space as OYB in core AW.<br/><br/>For Conan I might do something like:<br/><br/>"When you consider the relationship between barbarism and civilization..."<br/><br/>And then some stuff happens where you get information and maybe a +1 or -1 forward based on whether you are invigorated or depressed by your reflections.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335739/#Comment_335739" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T23:12:44+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 11:12PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2011 11:18PM by shreyas.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>gah eek eek</p>\n<p>First of all - moves don't have explicit misses.

I was designing 'Swear an Oath' like a move from the playbooks; many do specifically say what happens on a miss. But even after reading and re-reading Apocalypse World I didn't pick up that under the basic moves there is no specific results for a miss.<br/><br/>And thanks for pointing out that I need to specifically say what the hold does. I meant that it could be spent as another +1forward to a roll that involves directly accomplishing the goal you swore over. But I like the 'helping or interfering with yourself' thing a lot.<br/><br/>Deliverator: yes, I realize that OYB is basically a 'your player can know stuff' move, and have considered it for my hack, but couldn't find a place for it to fit thematically for all character types. That's why I made Augury basically do what OYB does in AW, except in my hack, only magical characters get it.<br/><br/>Edit: "Invigorated by your Oath" means you've basically psyched yourself up enough from making your oath (about something that could be far away or not immediately present) that you take +1 forward now, it doesn't have to be about your oath.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335744/#Comment_335744" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T00:09:57+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 12:09AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing that's tripping ME up here is that Conan would presumably be a low-Wyrd character, yet you'd think he'd be SUPER AWESOME at swearing oaths. My preference would be to still make the Basic Move for Wyrd be about the interacting with the Uncanny in a risky and unsettling way. the Oath move is invoking the Gods, but not in the uncanny "the Abyss also gazes back" way that open Your Brain does.<br/><br/>Maybe "When you converse with Strange Spirits or Old Gods, roll +Wyrd..." it wouldn't come up as much (ie you couldn't just do it whenevs, you'd have to find a situation where there's Spirits or Gods), but it would be more in keeping with how Wyrd would most likely be used in Conan. Are there any more general-purpose ways that people get their Wyrd on in Conan's stories? Maybe "When you speak of old superstitions or unsettling legends, roll +Wyrd..."<br/><br/>Shreyas' Move writeup is really hot in and of itself, though. But it's only good if your Wyrd is higher than Hot, Sharp or Cool, which again underscores the disconnect with Conan and Oaths.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf" title="Gavinwulf"><img alt="Gavinwulf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf">Gavinwulf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335750/#Comment_335750" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T00:25:45+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 12:25AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Joel, <br/>Several of the moves in the playbooks are, 'Use _____ instead of Weird when you Open your brain.' Likewise in my hack, Conan would have "Use Fierce (Hard) instead of Wyrd when Swearing an Oath".<br/><br/>But I like your idea too. I have been considering that as well, it does seem to have more punch thematically than swearing oaths would. But what would it actually do? Is the question. I wouldn't want it to be Acting Under Fire w/ scary things. Maybe remove the MC highlighting a second stat &amp; this move grants xp on a hit? <br/><br/>"Confront the Unnatural" sounds cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335753/#Comment_335753" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T00:40:52+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 12:40AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I almost typed "confront" in my last post, then replaced it. Because it's not always about facing down hostile monsters. I'm thinking of Mitra in "the Phoenix on the Sword," or the ancient being in "Tower of the Elephant." Conan recieves the former's aid and befriends and helps the latter. I'd want to cover shit like <i>that</i>, where the other is other, but not always an intractable evil.<br/><br/>Maybe it could be a Hold move, with a mix of friendly and hostile Hold options. So you could bind or repulse a Demon, or beseech the aid of a benevolent god, or what have you.<br/><br/>That oath-Swearing substitution is a solid option, though. I suppose if Oaths are the basic move, you could still have custom Wyrd Moves for individual entities, and such. Which is probably the way to go, anyway. If Set and the Elephant God are both approachable the same way on the same terms, that would be a bit boring.<br/><br/>I'd still like to see a basic Wyrd Move that reflects a dangerous encounter with the unknown. Maybe it could be just like Brain-Opening after all, where you seek answers, and the god gives them, clear or hazy, and questions you in return? It's like OYB personalized!<br/><br/>But ultimately, I don't have to play, you do!

Once the oath is complete, hold 3.  Holds may be spent, 1 for 1, to take +1 forward with the audience.<br/><br/>The idea being that if you swear an oath to one person they have expectations and once you fulfill that oath you have considerable sway over them.  On the other hand, if you, for example, swear an oath before the kings court, you could return victorious and use your good name to curry favors among members of the court.  The -1 ongoing only hurts you if you swear an oath and then stick around with out following up on your oath, I'm guessing that won't happen a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335792/#Comment_335792" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T10:56:42+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 10:56AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Carrots, guys!
