Suddenly, the amount of stuff actually worthy of a veto drops to almost nothing.<br/><br/>What actually happens is that people get asked to restate things or come at them a different way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231194/#Comment_231194" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T12:13:37+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 12:13PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            YES!<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been prosyletizing that for YEARS.<br/>\n<br/>\nUniversalis has a Challenge mechanic which comes in 2 parts...the friendly negotiation part, and the put your money where your mouth is part (which is essentially a resource based veto).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number of times I personally have experienced a Challenge go all the way to the bidding step in the last 8 years...like 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I've demoed the game dozens of times, and I can tell you that the games where I just skip explaining the Challenge rules (cuz they rarely get used anyway) and the times where the Challenge rules are featured promenantly are like night and day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith no Challenge rule explanation the game nearly always went immediately gonzo, the fastest / loudest player dominated play and others felt compelled to go along even if they didn't want to.  In games with the Challenge rules, that stuff hardly ever happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI call it negotiation with teeth.  If a player asks you to tone down the gonzo (or whatever) and has the mechanical means to back the request up, IME those requests are almost always met respectfully and quickly.  In the absence of mechanics with teeth the issue gets thrown back to the social level.  IMO over reliance on the social level to provide smooth play is a design flaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason I think veto / challenge mechanics are effective is because the provide a reason beyond the social to compromise.  Say I want something different from you.  Say there a mechanic in place that when triggered means one of us will get our way and the other won't...say its completely random (like "any other player can call for a roll off, high roller wins).  We now both have a motivation to reach compromise quickly because getting to a point where we can both agree is better for me than risking getting stuck with an unfavorable result.  You and I now have a motivation to come to an accord before someone else gets bored listening to us wrangle and calls for the roll off where we risk getting nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIME I've also found that, even in very socially functional groups, the ability to use the mechanics to bear the brunt of disatisfaction really helps avoid those awkward social moments where you fear you went to far in stating your case and the other player felt pressured.  By shifting it to the mechanical from the social it really helps avoid those line crossing moments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote also that there's a WIDE range of possible "how do you decide who gets their way" mechanics besides just outright veto.  Some will work exceedingly poorly for certain types of games / groups.  But I think there's always a way to come up with some variation that will work well, it might take a bit of digging and trial and error to get it to feel exactly right, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231200/#Comment_231200" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T12:16:02+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 12:16PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We were playing Houses of the Blooded and one of the players hadn't read the book and just wasn't taking in the source material.

What I've observed is that mechanics help navigate those issues and the act of players agreeing to play a game with those mechanics provides a certain default buy-in to having them handled that way.  When I've see hurt feelings IME having the hurt come from a procedure rather than a person helps reduce the sting somewhat.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when the sting comes from the realization that your friends don't think your contribution is as cool as you do that's not going to be prevented by a procedure.  But if a procedure can help cut it off at that so that the hurt doesn't fester into resentment by simply getting through it cleanly and without alot of unfortuneate things being said, then that's a distinct advantage IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232781/#Comment_232781" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T07:21:27+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  7:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ralph, so I've always been kinda squicky about vetos, so I'm trying to work a way around them.

Essentially saying that there is no mechanized veto option.<br><br>However, the system introduces consequences for your statements. Those consequences are created by the rest of the players, who also have the privilege of "Whatever you say happens, happens."<br><br>Also, before each game, I make it a part of the procedure to discuss the mood and scope of the game, so everyone comes to an agreement about whether to go big and gonzo or small and discrete.<br><br>So if one player introduces gonzo, but the rest of the group doesn't dig it, they have the option of mitigating that craziness through creative consequences. Vice versa also holds true as well.<br><br>It's working alright so far, but my game is heavily geared <i>towards</i> gonzo. :P                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232800/#Comment_232800" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T08:44:32+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  8:44AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2009 8:45AM by Valamir.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure.

I would submit for consideration that there has always been a veto power at everyone's table in every game we've ever played.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only question is whether that veto power is listed explicitly in the rules so everyone can use it equitably, or whether it simply manifests in the individual with the biggest personality, the most cutting eyeroll, the most forceful way of speaking, the most charming persuasiveness, the most pitful whine, or is just the person everyone wants to score with.  There are a million possibilites ranging from the subtle and hard to detect to the aggressive and obnoxious.

In Olde Skoole games, if that was the GM, you were ALL done... so the GM veto became a de facto Rule One (or veto or whatever). This can extend to the host or owner of the place you're playing, the most desirable player, and so forth as Ralph says. But with a Strong GM Game, the GM veto is a given, even if the notion doesn't come up in the game text at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232978/#Comment_232978" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T09:03:35+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  9:03AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really love all the insights into the implied veto that you guys have written.

There are a number of letters to choose from, each with their own subject matter and a kind of rating system that tells you whether this letter has violence, romance, intrigue, magic, and so on. So by picking a letter, your group is agreeing to focus on that kind of subject matter in this session.<br><br>Second, each letter has a few "Goal Words" in a sidebar next to it. Those are the NPCs, locations and noteworthy things mentioned in the letter. The group's goal is to try to incorporate each of those words into the story before time runs out. (There's a separate pacing mechanic involved here.) If you work them all in, then the PCs are hailed as heroes by the townsfolk. If you don't, then they're chased away by a pitchfork-wielding mob. Again, this is designed to keep everyone focused on the letter and its subject matter.<br><br>Lastly, and this is the biggest thing, the first step of play is for the group to discuss and come to an agreement on the tone of their stories. The game provides some new terms towards this end: Big Scope/Small Scope and Light Mood/Heavy Mood.\n<ul>\n<li>A <b>big scope</b> means the story affects whole worlds or large numbers of people over a long period of time.<br>A <b>small scope</b> means it focuses on a small group of characters in one place at one time without straying away very much.<br>A <b>light mood</b> is a comedy or slapstick story without much risk of anyone being in serious danger.<br>A <b>heavy mood</b> is a gritty drama where everyone's emotions are sincere and their motivations are grim.</br></br></br></li></ul>\nBy default, the game is set to Big/Light and all the examples of play are geared towards that tone as well. It's something like Futurama in tone, where the stories are usually silly and encompass entire planets and civilizations.<br><br>Still, I spend some time discussing the details of those other tones: Big/Heavy would be stuff like Battlestar Galactica. Small/Heavy would be like My So-Called Life. Small/Light could be Saved By the Bell. (You can play the game in those tones, but it would take up too much space in the book to write up examples of play for all four.)<br><br>So far in playtests, this terminology has been useful when someone steps over the line from light to heavy or small to big and vice versa. Players can (and have) said things to the affect of "Hey, that's kind of heavy for this game, can you lighten it up a bit?" and "Let's keep things small for now, we can make the story bigger in the climax."<br><br>Sooooo... With all those measures in place for the group to openly and explicitly state their intentions for the story, is it still worth adding a sidebar discussing the utility of an outright veto?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
