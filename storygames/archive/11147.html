So...a second try here.</i><br/><br/>Here's an idea I'm toying with.<br/><br/>It started basically as a kind of Power 19 that really delves into a setting and why it is suitable for a game environment.<br/><br/>Then it developed in a slightly different direction, evolving according to some of my own design theories.<br/><br/>I've looked at quite a few modern games and have noticed a trend toward simplified setting design. Instead of a hundred pages of background and dozens of possible storylines, these games start with a single impetus and enough background to set the tone. Lady Blackbird is a great example of this.<br/><br/>But I'm more interested in how minimal a setting can be, but still provide a good driving force for stories to develop. What do you need? What can you forget about initially, developing through the course of play (if the need arises)?<br/><br/>I'm sure plenty of GMs out there are familiar with the scenario where they write up a page or more of background, just to have their players ignore the plot thread linked to these details...mapping out a huge chunk of dungeon, only to find that the players die due to some bad die rolls, or take a left turn instead of a right.<br/><br/>This is an idea to propel plot with an impulse, not to bog it down with detail. It's really designed to get a game moving initially, but I don't see why it couldn't be used to provide further impetus to a game once it starts slowing down a bit.<br/><br/>So for my proposal...<br/><br/><i><b>9 Questions.</b> Each to be answered with a sentence or two (not much more).<br/><br/><b>1. What was the world like?</b> (This gives a base description of the established culture of the setting)<br/><b>2. What is the world like now?</b> (This gives an idea of where things seem to be heading based on recent events)<br/><b>3. How has the change in the world affected the characters?</b> (This brings the events of the setting a more personal and powerful feeling)<br/><b>4. Who caused the change?</b> (This determines who might need to be faced in the setting)<br/><b>5. Who is benefiting from the change?</b> (If the character's caused the change these might be potential allies, otherwise potential antagonists)<br/><b>6. Who is suffering due to the change?</b> (If the character's caused the change these might be potential antagonists, otherwise potential allies)<br/><b>7. What types of tasks need to be performed in the world?</b> (This gives an idea of the types of actions that become focal points of the story, and possibly ways to split the party roles)<br/><b>8. What is valued in the world?</b> (This gives an idea of the primary resource which will probably be a driving goal within the setting, and helps to define the world of the characters as different to the world of the players.)<br/><b>9. Are there any established relationships in the world?</b> (Once players start to interact with the setting, the allies they make will tend to cause others to view them in a more positive or negative light...and conversely, the people they cross will start to define their relationship to other factions).</i><br/><br/><br/>The aim is that the vital details for a whole setting can be written up in a page or so.<br/><br/>This setting is enough to play a game or two in...after which a new impulse could be used to drive the game further (a new change in the form of a new group in town, a change in the environment, a political shift, it could be anything)...but whatever happens, new things become important to the story. Perhaps the story moves to a new environment altogether for some reason.<br/><br/>Now, I'm just looking for ideas I might have missed in these core setting questions. I realise that I might have overlapped a few areas in some of the questions, and that there is probably a glaringly obvious gap that I haven't accounted for.<br/><br/>Any input to refine this concept would be welcomed.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247680/#Comment_247680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-20T15:05:00+00:00" title="December 20, 2009  3:05PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, I think the emphasis on character development is part of why less and less complex settings are needed. There's a trend of everything in the setting being derived from characters, whereas before there was a tendency to derive characters from setting. On top of that, a lot more games have the players negotiate and build a setting during play, meaning that the setting is almost nonexistent at the start, but significant by the end. In short, for deep character development I feel that no setting is needed, though one sentence (e.g. You're all trapped together on a subway.) might help get people on the same page in designing their characters.<br/><br/>The 9 questions you give seem to suggest a world-spanning issue, but deep development can just as easily be done with little things, or with emotional obstacles that are wholly internal to the character. Thus, questions 3 through 7 may be irrelevant to a story focused on the characters themselves (e.g. a romance), and question 1 and 2 may be merged (history may be irrelevant if the characters are trying to change themselves, not the world). 8 and 9 can be implied (e.g. the desire to survive in the subway setting sentence above).<br/><br/>That's a minimum. I don't think achieving the minimum is a good goal, but that's just my unfashionable preference in game design speaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247683/#Comment_247683" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-20T15:54:21+00:00" title="December 20, 2009  3:54PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2009 3:55PM by Judd.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=4236" rel="nofollow">This thread over at the BW forums might be worth looking at.</a><br/><br/>Also worth looking at are Mortal Coil, Shock: and Misspent Youth, all of which create collaborative settings with very precise purposes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247714/#Comment_247714" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T00:59:03+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 12:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obviously semantics are important in these questions (as they are in most questions)...the ways the questions are worded and the way people perceive them from a perspective separated from the asker...<br/><br/>I was actually thinking of questions 1 and 2 in more of a general sense, rather than simply "the world" as an outside entity. I was meaning to describe "the world of the characters" through these questions. 1 and 2 are simply meant to describe a contrast, a notion that <i>something</i> is happening in the world.<br/><br/>Consider the following three answers to the first 3 questions...<br/><br/>1. Everything was good, those who had problems weren't of much concern because they were on the outside of our perfect little world. We were loved.<br/>2. Nothing makes sense, life is hanging in the balance. We don't know what lies in store for us now.<br/>3. There are deeper things in the world that have started to raise their ugly heads. Now we must face jealousy and hatred from those who once viewed us with respect and awe.<br/> <br/>Consider that the answer to number 4 might be..."Each of the characters are siblings, the death of their mother caused the change"...this implies a very personal setting, and possibly something leading toward soap opera and melodrama. <br/><br/>It gives a very different setting to the following..."The change in the world occurred when the president was assassinated"...this could imply political turmoil, and a series of issues more global to be explored.<br/><br/>I guess with that in mind, the fourth question would better phrased as "What caused the change?" rather than "Who".<br/><br/>Questions 5 and 6 are more about how other people might have been affected by the things that have caused changes in the world of the characters...which links to 9 at some level.<br/><br/>7 is more about defining the niches that characters might fill in this particular setting.<br/><br/>8 is about global goals...in the examples above, the "dying mother" scenario might have a core value concept of "family love" with characters backstabbing and betraying one another in the hopes of looking like "the good one" (I know plenty of dysfunctional families like this in fiction and in life). In the "assassinated president" scenario the core value concept might be political power, as the players struggle against one another (and outside forces), to maintain stability in their country, and maybe even gaining a leadership role of their own in the process (or perhaps the players are all aides to a particular senator/diplomat, and the "win" condition for the story is getting their candidate into the oval office.<br/><br/>Your right that 8 and 9 can easily be implied, but I like to think it's good to have some potential milestones indicated up front. Things that players can choose to aim towards or aim to avoid.<br/><br/>I guess the whole idea of the questions is indicated in the thread title. An impulse toward a story.<br/><br/>...and Judd, I'll check out those threads...thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247735/#Comment_247735" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T05:55:12+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  5:55AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 7:49AM by madunkieg.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I may state that no setting is required, that's not how I like to make a setting and not what I like to play in a game. Neither do your questions produce a setting I'm interested in, either, because it's really set up for "go here, do this" sort of play, whereas I prefer "explore the meaning of this" sort of play. Let me give an example of a setting I really enjoy, Legend of the Five Rings (L5R). L5R uses factions and archetypes to explore a multitude of themes. Not every faction or archetype relates to every theme. Instead, each theme usually has 3 to 5 viewpoints given to it. For example, on the theme of enlightenment:<br/><br/>- Pheonix clan Asako have achieved immortality but not enlightenment<br/>- Dragon Clan Togashi are wholly dedicated to enlightenment but can't achieve it because they follow a dragon and enlightenment is a human trait<br/>- the monks of Shinsei are peacefully creeping towards enlightenment<br/>- the temple of seven fortunes, monks who attempt to appease the gods so that they don't feel abandoned by humans seeking enlightenment<br/>- the Kolat are humanists and therefore in opposition to enlightenment<br/><br/>On the theme of battle:<br/>- Crab are wholly pragmatic and focused on defense<br/>- Lion are in it for the glory and focused on tactics or battle rage<br/>- Crane Daidoji focus on tactics, but are unafraid to play dirty and fight guerilla style<br/>- Pheonix are largely pacifists, protected by one family of yojimbo (bodyguards), the Shiba<br/><br/>...and so on through literally dozens of themes. This method of designing a setting creates a great sandbox world. Despite the complexity it generates, the use of factions and archetypes, each of which is built on a combination of a few themes, makes entry into the game fairly quick. It is not, however, a quick and easy method of generating a setting. It takes a lot of prep work, and is more suited to deep, rather than impulse play.<br/><br/>EDIT: I realize that this style isn't what you're going for, but I hope it's of some use to you to understand another alternative                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate" title="mike_the_pirate"><img alt="mike_the_pirate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/r_goulet/smalliconmike.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate">mike_the_pirate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247751/#Comment_247751" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T07:16:37+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  7:16AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">But I'm more interested in how minimal a setting can be, but still provide a good driving force for stories to develop.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nCheck out any Samuel Beckett or theatre of the Absurd play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247874/#Comment_247874" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T13:43:05+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  1:43PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Madunkieg,<br><br/>I love the idea of fully realised settings, and I could easily envision a quick set of impulse questions being phrased for a specific subset within an established sandbox.<br/><br/>On the theme of enlightenment, the basic kicker question (number 4) could be answered..."A novice in a far-flung temple has developed a series of new kihos very quickly in a very short period of time after meditation and communion with a very pure spirit. This has confused the order of Shinsei who have sent librarians and scholars to investigate."<br/><br/>The following questions could be quickly answered with a look at the different factional interpretations of enlightenment. Factions within the Dragon clan would be certainly interest in this new method of quickly gaining enlightenment with a quantifiable output, Members of the Pheonix would be worried that a new form of uncategorised magic might be at work, the Bloodspeakers would be doing their usual thing and making the most advantage of the chaos and possible witch-hunt in a direction other than their own, the Scorpion might be hoping to twist the new "rapid enlightenment" techniques to their own mysterious ends...<br/><br/>You know the setting, you have a kicker that sets things into motion and you tie in factions where players have an interest (or the most obvious factions related to the kicker event).<br/><br/>If everyone is on the same page regarding a setting, then I'm trying to develop a set of questions that turn the setting into a story. <br/><br/>If everyone is on the same page regarding the type of story they want to tell, then I'd like to think the questions can be retro-activated for the foundations of a setting.<br/><br/>If everyone knows the setting and the story, then the questions have probably already been asked and answered instinctively.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248010/#Comment_248010" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T05:19:35+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  5:19AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 5:20AM by madunkieg.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking along the lines of kickers, and looking back at entries from a lot of 10-day design contest entries, I can't help but wonder if some of those settings were designed using these questions:<br/><br/>1. What is the goal?<br/>2. Who are the heroes?<br/>3. What stands between them?<br/><br/>Your questions 1 and 2 become implied, rather than explicit. So, that's another very minimal approach. Here's another:<br/><br/>1. Who are the heroes?<br/>2. Who are the enemies?<br/>3. What equipment do they have?<br/><br/>I may argue that doesn't produce an interesting story, but there seem to be a lot of people out there that disagree with me, and game design sales seem to back them up. This time your questions 1 and 2 are usually implied by my question 3.<br/><br/>Just throwing ideas out there as they come.
