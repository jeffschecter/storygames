But this is pretty much my favorite aspect of American history (because I'm fascinated in a "watch a train wreck") sort of way.<br/><br/>First off, the relationship between the natives of North and South America and the European settlers is long and complex. If you narrow it down to what occurred in what is now the United States, you're still talking about events occurring between the late 1500s to the late 1800s (yes, stuff happened outside those date ranges, but I'm trying to focus on what I'm assuming he wants to look at). So over the course of about 300 years (approximately 15 generations) relationships changed significantly. And even at any given point, a range of different opinions and attitudes were present on both sides.<br/><br/>So any sort of answer to these questions are, by necessity, going to be summations and generalizations. (And I think that would be key to any sort of RPG portrayal of the subject matter. There are going to be differences of approach and opinion on all sides, which is good for making story stuff happen.)<br/><br/>Probably the most significant factors in place the whole time were the fractionalization of American Indian cultures and the vast ongoing power differential.<br/><br/>There are dozens and dozens and dozens of different tribes. I just did a quick count on a culture website and got to 106. And I think that number is probably quite low and represents some clustering. And those tribes had complex relationships with each other - they ofter raided or warred with each other. Many tribe names are actually the unfriendly names used by other tribes to refer to them.<br/><br/>For a European equivilant, think about the celtic clans of Ireland and Scotland. When the Romans were invading, they'd make an alliance with one clan while attacking another. The same sort of thing happened with the Indians. Now imagine that the Romans not only had big organized armies but also had guns and much better medicine practices. How much easier would it have been for them to conquer?<br/><br/>The biggest challenge for the Europeans was getting a foothold. So the earliest contact with Indians were on the eastern coast, like the Algonquian speaking tribes, not on the plains. Initial contact was relatively tentative, cautious, and generous. This time period is where we get things like the story of the first Thanksgiving. This is also the time period of things like Lewis and Clark and Pocahontas.<br/><br/>Later, once a foothold was established, expansion began. That's where you get the treaty breaking. Every couple of generations the population of Europeans would double. And they'd need/want more space. So they'd break the treaties their grandparents made and expand. These were things that happened over periods of like 50 years, not 5, for the most part. 50 years is a pretty long time for a treaty to last in most any period of history (yes, some last much longer. But many many don't.)<br/><br/>After a while, the expansion happened over and over again. Regarding this time period, you should look up the term Manifest Destiny. The term itself was only used for a relatively brief period, but it's a pretty good summation of what a lot of Europeans felt about westward expansion.<br/><br/>Also, you might want to look at the book Guns, Germs, and Steel. Not everyone agrees with the theories in there, but they're certainly interesting. And it's a good look at conquering that took place over lots of history and points out how a lot of similar patterns show up.<br/><br/>There's some thoughts to get started.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345870/#Comment_345870" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T17:26:59+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  5:26PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Anyone here able to give me some hints to:<br/><br/>- main reasons to why relations between white settlers and indians went sour?<br/><br/>- what main elements was present in negotiations between whites and indians?<br/><br/>- why was treaties broken, again and again?<br/><br/>- if I was a white man visiting a indian prairie-tribe, early in the settling of America; how would I be met?<br/><br/>Any hints will be greatly appreciated!</blockquote>\nThat's a very broad question, since the American Indians were in no way unified culturally or politically.  There is a huge diversity of languages, culture, and customs.  The main reason for breakdown of relations was generally over land use - the English colonials always wanted more land for herding and farming, and tended to view Indians as an obstacle to that.  Treaties were frequently broken when the colonials wanted more land.  That was why early on the French trapper colonials in Canada tended to have better relations, since the trappers did not want to push Indians off their land, and were usually willing to pay for use.  <br/><br/>The last question really depends on the specifics of the time and place.  Basically, if a Prairie Indian tribe at that point has had bad relations with colonials recently, then they can expect suspicious treatment at best.  However, if they have had few recent clashes, then they may be curious and positive. Relations got better and worse at various times, and differently for different tribes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345875/#Comment_345875" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T17:36:34+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  5:36PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Halito. Chim achukma? Achukma hoke. <br/><br/>I will preface this by saying that I am Choctaw. My ancestors were the first tribe to walk the Trail of Tears. I grew up on the Coeur d'Alene reservation, and I graduated from medical school having earned both my medical degree as well as a Certificate in Indian Health. I cannot speak for Native America, and while grounded in a strong sense of history, my opinions will likely cause some who fancy themselves as historians to take umbrage, but I think that you do deserve an answer to your question. <br/><br/>First, I think you need to narrow your question some. North America is a huge place, and as such, there were millions of Native Americans, and it was not at all a homogeneous place culturally. My ancestral people are way different than the people who I grew up with, and my Navajo friends are way different from my Ojibwe friends. Thinking of Natives as one people, especially in a historical sense, would be like considering all Asians throughout history to be the same. Huge mistake. As such, the only commonality in the history is Native people's interaction with a seemingly never ending invasion, and even this is a little too simplistic considering that England, France, Spain, as well as the US government all interacted with Native people in ways that would lead to prosecution for war crimes in the modern world. Not an invasion by a single political entity or united people. Just a bunch of different people, all with basically the same disregard for the rights of the aboriginal people of North America.<br/><br/>As for why they went sour, consider hanging out in your neighborhood, when suddenly a bunch of new and highly armed and violent people show up and kick you out of your house, telling you that it is now theirs. We'll call these new people the White family. They tell you, "Don't worry, we just want this house. You take a different house, or maybe go live with your Aunt across the street." At first you figure that there are plenty of houses, and we can all get along, so you move two houses down the block. The White family practically starves that first winter, and after helping them out with some food and such, they make it through that year.<br/><br/>Next thing you know, Mr. White calls his brother up and invites him to come live in the neighborhood. To prove that it is a good place, Mr. White sends the severed hands of several local kids to his brother. That gets everyone excited. You are just settling down to watch a football game (the Redskins are playing the Chiefs), when the door gets bashed in, your son is shot in the face, your daughter is raped, and you are thrown out of your house again. You are told that, in order for there to be any peace, you have to move all the way across the Mississippi river! Fuck! You don't really want to go, but next thing you know, the Feds have put a bounty on the skin the grows on your head! And then that stash of blankets that the White family gave you to say thanks for keeping us alive that first winter, it was coated in biological weapons, and now most everyone you know is sick or dead. <br/><br/>I think that this is getting close to the point in history that you were most interested in, but consider that there subsequently was a national policy made to move Native people as far away from their ancestral lands as possible, children were taken forcefully from parents and enrolled in boarding schools where they were beaten for speaking their own language, Native spiritual practices were considered to not count with regards to the constitutional right to freedom of religion and were made illegal, and eventually entire tribes were told that they no longer existed in an effort to eliminate any Native cultural identity. It was only in the early 1970s that Native people were able to practice their cultural and spiritual practices without fear of being jailed.<br/><br/>I think that in the end, I have to ask "Which tribe's experience with stolen ancestral lands, organized policies of cultural extermination, indiscriminate violence and concerted acts of war to include biological weapons, and repeated broken international treaties are you most interested in?" They are all similar, but happen at different times, were tolerated to different degrees, and had different results.\n<blockquote>- main reasons to why relations between white settlers and indians went sour?</blockquote> Probably because there was no regard for the fundamental human rights of Native people shown by the white settlers. Lying to, stealing from, killing, raping, or otherwise doing anything you want to Native people was not only considered OK, it was actually subsidized by and even perpetrated by the federal government!\n<blockquote>- what main elements was present in negotiations between whites and indians?</blockquote> The main element was that white people wanted Native land. So they offered peace in return for the land. "We will stop shooting you in the face if we never see your face around here again."\n<blockquote>- why was treaties broken, again and again?</blockquote> Because native people were living in places that white people wanted to. So white people ignored the fact that an international treaty was signed acknowledging the right of the Native people to live there, and so some people got shot over it. Again and again.\n<blockquote>- if I was a white man visiting a indian prairie-tribe, early in the settling of America; how would I be met?</blockquote> Depends on which tribe, when you showed up, what the tribe's experience with white people had been, how you acted, and how many friends with guns you brought with you. <br/><br/>I should probably stop there before I get too emotional about it. I apologize ahead of time if anyone is offended by my treatment of the subject. It is too huge to get at the subtleties in a forum post, took me both a lifetime of personal experience as well as a formal program of education over 4 years to get at, and ultimately it comes down to racism and complete disregard of the human rights of an entire continent of people. I am also a little sensitive because of the recent observance of Columbus day, and having to explain to people why I do not celebrate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345911/#Comment_345911" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T21:45:46+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  9:45PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2011 9:56PM by Andy.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Lee: Thank you very much for the general breakdown of the issue and replies to Tomas.<br/><br/>Tomas, as a point of curiosity, were there issues in Norwegian history that regarded indigenous people, or cultural sublimation/genocide of one people over another?

Thank you very, very much!<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Tomas, as a point of curiosity, were there issues in Norwegian history that regarded indigenous people, or cultural sublimation/genocide of one people over another?</blockquote>Yes, there were. <br/><br/>I'm partly <i>sami</i> myself, and have knowledge of how they were treated. As late as the 70s sami children were sent to boarding schools, were they were beaten for talking sami. They were forbidden to practice their beliefs. Whatever rights they had were undermined by an unholy alliance of state, church and greedy private entrepreneurs. Judges were as biased as the rest of society, so no justice were given to a sami man who was tricked or mistreated. Any small "rebellions" (victimized people protesting, amongst other things by boycotting official shops, and their liqueur) were met with guns and hangings.<br/><br/>The same happened to the <i>romani</i> people in Norway. Children were taken away, and given to foster-families, to be "assimilated". They were often mistreated in their foster-families, and regarded as free labor on farms. At schools such children were systematically vilified and mistreated by teachers and peers. They were considered primitive and dumb, and "lucky to be given proper education" (yes, to beat and vilify a child is very proper, you know). Adult romani were forced to sterilize, to ensure that the "problem" would go away.<br/><br/>In later years I've looked into the sami part of our modern history, and found that the hurt is still there. Anger and shame is still smoldering in many a soul, and in many a small village, especially in the north. Old men and women learned to be Norwegians the hard way, and some of them still hides the fact that they are sami. I talked with a sami man last year, up north. A friend told that the man was actually sami, and that he had experience with boarding schools, and that interested me. So I asked him about it ... Ouch! He stiffened and his smile died. He turned and walked away. No answer, and no word of goodbye. He just left. <br/><br/>Healing is taking place, with pride and positive cultural identity building. But a lot of sami people are deeply hurt, and that makes it hard to talk about their experiences. It also makes some of them act with little empathy towards others, as well as their own. The healing of a mistreated society and a vilified culture is painfully slow.<br/><br/>The same took place in Sweden, regarding both sami and romani. <br/><br/>In Denmark you have the "problem" with inuits on Greenland. Them being so primitive, their children were taken in early age and sent over the sea to Denmark, to "be given the benefits of civilization". There they were placed in foster-homes, dressed up in strange clothes, not knowing anything about the culture, the climate or the language. Not knowing at all where they were. And they were met with little love by foster parents, those being instructed to be "very firm in raising these wild children". I've read some instruction-manuales from the time, and they had some interesting paragraphs on inuit hygiene. Imagine being 5 years old, having such an experience; what a trauma! I believe this particular practice ended in the early 70s. There are lots of really heartbreaking tragedies in that history. <br/><br/><i>Normality</i> has been a brutal tyrant in most parts of the world, at some time in history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345927/#Comment_345927" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T01:01:38+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  1:01AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2011 1:18AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite>Halito.

Achukma hoke.</blockquote>Lee; although I do not understand this particular part of your answer, yours is the closest to what I am seeking; the brutal facts of what could take place in such "cultural clashes", pointing to the direct and material causes to fuel the mistreatment.<br/><br/>I feel your resentment when writing about it, and feel some of that resentment myself, when writing about <i>sami</i> peoples in Norway (there are several tribes here too), although I have never been part of that culture myself. My identity stems from my father being born on a small farm, in the south of Norway, far from <i>Sapmi</i> (sami-lands). But my mother was from the north, and had a sami grandmother. That's the link, for me. <br/><br/>My father was a younger brother, so the farm went to his older sibling. He started working as a navvy, doing roads and tunnels, and later took employment as a smith in a factory. So my childhood were split between growing up in a dense industrial town, visiting the farm of my fathers family in the summers, and driving up north to visit my mothers family there. While young I had no idea of sami culture at all, other than the occasional glimpse of them in strange tents by the roadside, selling colorful raindeer-trinkets to tourists.<br/><br/>As an adult in Oslo (our capital), while displaying some sympathy for the sami-people one day, my mother suddenly told me I was part sami myself. She told me little about it, only that my great grandmother was sami. And then, later on, when taking a lift in the gigantic apartment building where I lived, I shared it with three drunken old men. I realized they were sami, all of them. And then I realized that a great part of the old drunkards living in that apartment building (the "apartments" were only single rooms) was in fact sami. Single, tragic old men, living in small rooms in our capital, far from <i>Sapmi</i>, seeking "comfort" in hard booze. That got me thinking; why were they there? Why were all of them drunkards?<br/><br/>That spurred my interest in relations between "big society" and indigenous culture. And it's a background to me asking these questions.<br/><br/>So, to go on:<br/><br/>- How did so many Europeans develop such brutal positions in this process? Why did so many become so brutal?

Stuff like that happened all over Europe, and not necessarily to the indigenous population only. I'm inclined to say this is due to a general human tendency of xenophobia and also because power structures hate rebels - they're difficult to rule over.<br/><br/>As an example from where I grew up - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" rel="nofollow">Partitions of Poland</a> and split between Prussia, Russia and Austria. Afterwards, the population endured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisation_of_Poles_during_Partitions" rel="nofollow">germanisation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification#Poland_and_Lithuania" rel="nofollow">russification</a> due to them not feeling part of the nations they were forcefully joined to. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drzyma%C5%82a%27s_wagon" rel="nofollow">Drzyma\u0142a's wagon</a> is one example of how people tried to oppose this process. Wiki says that "Frederick the Great settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of Prussia and aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility, which he treated with contempt and likened the 'slovenly Polish trash' in newly reconquered West Prussia to the Iroquois." (didn't know that last bit)<br/><br/>Then after Poles got their country back after WWII, they turned around and resettled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemkos" rel="nofollow">Lemkos</a> during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Vistula" rel="nofollow">Operation Vistula</a>, in order to remove support for Ukrainian partisans.<br/><br/>And so it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345948/#Comment_345948" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T05:40:16+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  5:40AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two books if you're interested:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lies-My-Teacher-Told-Everything/dp/0684818868" rel="nofollow">Lies My Teacher Told Me</a>, this one is fairly brief and a pretty quick read.  The book is about some of the historical inaccuracies taught in American high school, it isn't exhaustive though.  Only a couple chapters deal with Native Americans, but the one on Columbus will have some really good historical info for you.  It'll also give some great examples of how a people can be willfully ignorant of the crimes they or their fore bearers commit.  There are a couple more sections on slavery and racism, which is tangentially related.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/zinnapeopleshistory.html" rel="nofollow">A People's History of the US</a>, is closer to a complete general history text, it covers a lot of the bad shit that happened in the US.<br/><br/>In America, we like to envision that we forged this country from wilderness. White people arrived and "settled' the land.  There is some speculation that the Black Death was carried to America by fisherman who would resupply before heading back to England.  Whatever it was, it's estimated that it killed some 90-96 percent of the population.  Shortly after the Mayflower landed, they sent someone to entreat with a tribe they had no contact with yet, about 40 miles away, all they found were skulls and bones, hundreds if not thousands.  The pilgrims didn't settle land, they just moved in.<br/><br/>That story got repeated time and again, though not always with the tribe being dead before the settlers arrived (as Nameless described quite well).<br/><br/>The racism present I think has it's roots in two European events, or at least the ideologies that allow for racism.  One is the history of conflict between the English and the Irish.  The Irish for a long time have been treated as little better than slaves, not for individual failings, but usually just because they're Irish.  It's part of the nature of conflict, you dehumanize the enemy, if you do it long enough, that dehumanization itself becomes a reason to continue the conflict.<br/><br/>The other would be the Spanish Inquisition.  There had been other inquisitions before, but there was a notable shift with this one.  Previously, when a Jew converted, they were considered now to be Christian (baring relapses, secret rituals, etc).  During the Spanish Inquisition, that never really happened, they continued to be prosecuted and even the children of Jews were seen as unable to be Christian, because they were born to Jewish parents, it became a matter of lineage.<br/><br/>A lot of the influences that produce alcohol and drug addictions are cultural.  Indigenous people had everything taken away from them, given shit land and looked down upon.  Their children stolen from their homes, given demeaning educations and taught how their people are lazy and stupid.  People born into poverty often stay in poverty, not because of genetics, but because they get crappy educations and told they'll never amount to anything.  People in poverty have higher chances of drug and alcohol abuse, which certainly doesn't get you out of poverty.  It's a very self-perpetuating cycle.<br/><br/>The church isn't necessarily the cause of a lot of these cultural problems, but rather a tool used by people to perpetuate and perpetrate what they are doing.  Against the native peoples, it was always God's will. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_upon_a_Hill" rel="nofollow">The City Upon a Hill</a> is a common theme in America.  It was God's will that white people spread over this land and make it their own, it was their promised land, paradise on earth.  We were special... but that "we" didn't include the native peoples.<br/><br/>As an aside, this is a really good documentary series about America and our relationship with religion.  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/" rel="nofollow">God in America</a><br/><br/>I haven't really discussed this topic much in the past 10 years, but I'll see if I can't refresh myself to help you out, as its a collection of topics I find extremely fascinating.  A lot of it comes down to the process of dehumanizing "other peoples" and how it shapes the relations between people and the people who do the dehumanizing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345952/#Comment_345952" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T06:28:54+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  6:28AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tomas, there are some pretty good books on this in English, if you're interested, by scholars from a number of ethnic backgrounds, though the best ones -- in my experience -- are locally or regionally focused.  Even in the really early days of North and South American colonialism, these interactions were taking place all over.  So if you pick a region to focus on, there are probably resources that examine these dynamics.  Even the churches involved were different, with Catholicism in the Southwest and parts of Canada vs. various different Protestant groups in the east. And the tactics chosen were sometimes different regarding Christian and non-Christian indigenous peoples, people of mixed ethnicity, etc., but othertimes everyone got lumped together. And the interactions changed dramatically over time, based on historical events, individual leaders, and further white expansion. Generalizations are hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345957/#Comment_345957" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T06:54:11+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  6:54AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2011 7:04AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for kind recommendations of books to read.

Players are settlers. That is; peaceful farmers seeking their fortune in lands free from oppression. But the lands they settle is brimming with indigenous tribes; nomads that live of the land, being hunter-gatherers with stone tools, wise elders, proud youths, and a shared culture well developed both in arts and crafts.<br/><br/>There has been some contact, and now the settlers have planned to seek up the local tribes. Their intention is to negotiate with them for the land they have already taken (negotiating to be left alone; they are too weak to defend themselves against any aggression). They have not chased anyone away by taking the land, and have not been aggressive. Still there is a resentment building amongst younger elements of the tribes, over their presence, and that have led to some unfortunate episodes (tribal youths stole a sheep, pelted a settlers cabin with stones, threatened loggers, frightened a child, etc.). <br/><br/>The resentment is partly due to the fact that other tribes has given up land to human settlers one generation earlier, and some younger ones feel that these new settlements, outside the lands that was given up in the treaty, is in violation of that treaty (it's not a formal breach, but very much a violation of its spirit). The players/settlers have no idea such a treaty exist, and are only in this to secure their own living.<br/><br/>I might mention that the tribes of this game is orcs. I've chosen to use orcs, to make it easier to swarth them with rumors of being "beastly, dangerous, un-trustworthy and cannibalistic". And I use the appearances of the orcs (green, fanged, smelly) to send mixed signals on how they behave;<br/>- smiling = grinning with fangs and sharpened teeth<br/>- flirting = pissing on your feet, rubbing against you, grunting<br/>- initiating friendship = licking your face with blue tongues <br/>- friendly greetings = high five (holding up the hand; failure to meet it in high five may be perceived as unfriendly, or insulting)<br/><br/>The point is to make the orcs stand forth as strange and revolting, and possibly a bit provocative. And to lay the grounds for misunderstandings. I want the players to feel that it is hard to have close contact with the orcs, supporting any inclinations in them towards xenophobia and brutal responses.<br/><br/>They do not share language, but some settlers have heard that one old orc, in one tribe, is able to make itself understood in human tongue. I believe that will be true for most tribes, so as not to make verbal discourse totally impossible.<br/>__________________________________<br/><br/>And as a philosophical basis for this, however far-fetched it may sound, I'm trying to learn more of what took lace in particular meetings between indians and whites. That will help me big time in acting up when the settlers starts to interact with the tribes in a more direct manner. <br/><br/>So; any hints to actual happenings, actions and responses, misunderstandings and souring relations, good relationships (and how they came about), would be very helpful, and very much appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346047/#Comment_346047" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-15T05:12:56+00:00" title="October 15, 2011  5:12AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Anyone here able to give me some hints to:<br/><br/>- main reasons to why relations between white settlers and indians went sour?<br/><br/>Any hints will be greatly appreciated!</blockquote>\nJust to point out a few factors : <br/><br/><b>- Endogamic factor</b> : English settlers were rather coming with their wife and families.

In the context of this scenario, I think that the fantasy historical context of Orcs is such that there is an implied evil in them that is generally understood by the overall gaming culture, and with the release of the Steven Jackson Lord of the Rings movies, it would seem like there could be no one aware of popular American culture that would not understand that Orcs are tainted sub-human monsters with no redeemable souls who are only capable of wanton destruction and violence. Choosing Orcs gives the players an implicit divine order to commit genocide on these tribes.<br/><br/>You have basically recreated all the elements necessary to whip up a good old early American style genocide. I will take this all in the best light and believe that you really have not meant to offend anyone, and the intention of all of this is to explore some difficult concepts and hopefully make better choices or at least understand some of the choices in the historical context of theses situations. I also warn you that many people will not be so generous about interpreting your intentions. My parents still live on the reservation and are far enough below the poverty line as to be almost unbelievable, all as a result of the events that you are interested in, and who have friends who were sent to boarding schools for "assimilation", as well as my many friends who are not even recognized by the federal government as Native because of the federal policy of cultural extermination, they would likely be extremely offended.<br/><br/>You should also know that it will be hard to realistically condemn anyone who goes on to engage in massive genocide in your scenario. You have peaceful farmers who "just didn't know" that this is a bad idea, set against a horde of disgusting monsters who "God" considers an unnatural abomination, and the monsters have started trouble by thieving and harassing the settlers. There would seem to be only one logical conclusion. <br/><br/>And a last thing, to draw inspiration for your Orc horde vs. peaceful settlers scenario from Native American history, and then frame the Natives as the Orcs can at best be seen as insensitive. It would be more accurate for the races in your scenario and the historical connotations of each of those races to have been reversed. From a Native perspective, it is often hard not to think of the European Invasion as something different than what a fantasy human would perceive an advancing Orc horde like.

In the context of this scenario, I think that the fantasy historical context of Orcs is such that there is an implied evil in them that is generally understood by the overall gaming culture</blockquote>The orcs are indeed different; they do not send the souls of their dead to paradise; they leave them for birds to eat!<br/><br/>And yes; I really want to use the perception of orcs as evil in pop-culture, to tempt my players into some traps (I do hope, and expect, them to avoid some of the traps anyway).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite> I will take this all in the best light and believe that you really have not meant to offend anyone, and the intention of all of this is to explore some difficult concepts and hopefully make better choices or at least understand some of the choices in the historical context of theses situations. I also warn you that many people will not be so generous about interpreting your intentions. My parents still live on the reservation and are far enough below the poverty line as to be almost unbelievable, all as a result of the events that you are interested in, and who have friends who were sent to boarding schools for "assimilation", as well as my many friends who are not even recognized by the federal government as Native because of the federal policy of cultural extermination, they would likely be extremely offended.</blockquote>No one are playing any indians here; I'm collecting inspiration from indian history, to create something that wsill help my players react and act realistically in such a situation. The players will play their characters, and I will play my orcs and other NPCs within the framework of my fantasy-world. It is not a re-enactment of indian-white conflicts. It is a fantasy role-playing game played out with more ambition than you are used to. That is all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite>And a last thing, to draw inspiration for your Orc horde vs. peaceful settlers scenario from Native American history, and then frame the Natives as the Orcs can at best be seen as insensitive. </blockquote>This is sensitive role-playing.

If I were to portray the orcs as beasts, and nothing else, it would all be about heroes killing bad orcs, as in most other frpg's. <br/><br/>So it is important for the game that the players get mixed signals; prejudice in rumors, and in self-justified second hand tales of violence, contrasted by strangely peaceful behavior and/or tantalizing beauty in their own experiences. I want to weave a weave that makes the players have good good reason to doubt the righteousness of it, if their characters are going for violent domination of the orcs.<br/><br/>And I want any violent actions to come back and haunt them, by making the picture more and more complex as the campaigns go on. Eventually I may go for using orcs to save some of the characters, maybe even from frustrated and mistreated orcs ... I would greatly enjoy seeing the players/characters go for brute force, and then have the orcs conquer the moral high ground!<br/><br/>My campaigns will go on for a year, with one session in each campaign each and every week.

Why is it racist to map a race to each culture? Simply because the whites are humans, so the culture represented by orcs is necessarily implied to be inferior? I disagree entirely. It's only racist if the characters participate in cultural discrimination or genocidal acts. The mapping of the races, in my opinion, only seems to serve the purpose of creating a visual contrast between the cultures. In any case, he is trying to create an analogous situation to ~1550-1800 Americas, not actual historical play. Would it be less offensive if he used elves as the first peoples' analogue?

If you were to run a colonizing game with a bunch of people who may not be familiar with the impacts of conquest, I think it's a very valid story to try to "set them up" to do horrible things without them realizing how bad they are, and then do a big reveal of the real impact.<br/><br/>Big green orc commits atrocities results in a thought like "yeah, I did that cause I was a big green orc and they're mean and vicious"<br/><br/>Nice pink human commits atrocities might result in a thought like "oh wow, that's really horrible what I just did, I can understand how it happened, but it's horrible and should never happen again"<br/><br/>For me, coming from a perspective of privilege, it's good to see the truth of the genocide that was committed, but I'm also very interested to see why it happened, what forces allowed or pushed it to happen, how to recognize when something like that is starting and possibly how to stop it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346153/#Comment_346153" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-15T21:15:34+00:00" title="October 15, 2011  9:15PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used the Orc / Indian mapping to great effect in one of my favorite campaigns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe campaign was eastern civilization / remnants of a shattered romanesque empire meets western frontier full of promise, freedom for oppressed lower castes who can escape across the Mississippiesque river, boom towns, and pioneer hardships...except for the fact that the lands were already inhabited by tribes of orcs and goblins.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe campaign couldn't have gone any better.  Initial meetings with orcs lead to exactly the kind of D&amp;D; kill 'em and take their stuff mentality that one would expect from D&amp;D; players who encounter something labeled "Orc".  It was several sessions in before the full impact of the parallel to the American West hit (I hadn't made it explicit up front) and my players were rather chagrined at how easily they had fallen into the trap of simply committing genocide.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis to me is far more impactful than if I'd made then indianesque human tribes...then the innate Political Correctness of the players would have put them on the high road from the start.  But by calling the tribes orcs the players started with the same assumptions about their subhuman nature as most Europeans held for indigenous peoples.  That made them realize that despite the rhetoric they were just as willing to massacre other people's as Cortez had been...human nature hadn't changed, only the labels of who gets included in the genocide-ok vs. genocide-not-ok box has changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey weren't exactly thrilled with my tactic, but once they caught on there was far less kill-on-sight and far more legitimate interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can you put players into that mindset without using something that they'll knee jerk react negatively to and have little compunction against killing.  Of course if you actually make the orcs bloodthirsty savages with no redeeming qualities...THAT would be pandering to baser instincts, but simply labeling them orcs and seeing how people react differently than if you labeled them people...that strikes me as particular powerful...and useful...commentary.  It was memories of this campaign that made me such a huge fan of John Wick's Orkworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean how is that any different than 3:16 which IMO uses bugs and aliens for exactly the same purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346157/#Comment_346157" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-15T22:22:46+00:00" title="October 15, 2011 10:22PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome, Ralph.

Trolls in my world is BIG and though, and the characters were far from it, so they were in deep shit. But they prevailed. One of them had the luck of spearing one of the trolls, basically by having the troll throwing itself on the spear, while the character managed to put the butt of the spear in the ground, so he could hold it. The spear went right trough the chest of the troll, and into its spine. The troll hung above him, looking down into his face, dying ...<br/><i>(the players were shouting at this point, standing up, doing HUZZAH!)</i><br/>- "And then tears start to fall from the eyes of the troll, into your face", said I: "It is crying".<br/><br/>The player got totally confused. He said, and I quote; <i>But, but ... but why is it crying???</i> The other players were as confused as him. It was a shock to them, that a dying troll would cry. With their idea of what trolls were, it was inconceivable.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite>From a Native perspective, it is often hard not to think of the European Invasion as something different than what a fantasy human would perceive an advancing Orc horde like. Bloodthirsty, without respect for law, and espousing hateful and derogatory things about the rights and fitness of those being invaded</blockquote>This is another campaign; having the players be natives, seeing their land and folks run over by monsters. It is an interesting one, but not what I'm about to do now.<br/><br/>I've explored how sami and gypsies people have been treated in Norwegian society, in former campaigns, and have had players tear themselves apart with the frustration over being beheld as dirty, dumb and drunken, and being stripped of all rights modern men take for granted. It's a scenario that lays the basis for really eyeopening interaction, when executed well. <br/><br/>I expect my present campaigns will be small eyeopeners too. My present campaigns will try to open a window into the souls of the prejudiced oppressors. That is my main agenda. And the soul of it is in center. Having my players behaving differently than the historical evidence show, is fine with me, as long as we get to explore their inner field of xenophobia. So; to make it clear; this is not a game about cowboys and indians; it's a game focusing on prejudice and xenophobia, and how the players choose to deal with it. I am trying to prepare myself for the encounters, by asking how relations between whites and indians developed (what happened, on the ground, between individuals of the two groups), so I may give he players a chance to measure themselves against some realistic actions/reactions form the orc side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346173/#Comment_346173" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T00:35:15+00:00" title="October 16, 2011 12:35AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2011 12:35AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I think you want your players to act like killers, and regret it.</blockquote>No, Robert, as stated above; I want my players to measure themselves against some realistic actions/reactions from the orcs, and see how they hold up in the conflict.

What you proposing is an intellectual exercise, with next to no emotional investment in character. That is, to me, a dull place to be. I'm not overly fond of the character polygamy of a lot of modern games. In this instance it would totally kill my objective. The agenda of tapping into the soul of the oppressor, would be null and void if executed in the manner you propose.<br/><br/>But you do that.

What are their lives like, and what's important to them?  What do they see as valuable, sacred, beautiful?  What do they hunt, eat, drink, worship, fight, and fear?  Who are their enemies, who are their friends?  What's their system for ownership of things, people and places?  How often do they relocate?  What food do they cultivate?  What trappings and behaviors express social status?<br/><br/>Once you know what it's like to be an Orc, you can react to the humans the way any reasonable Orc would.

That is my main agenda. And the soul of it is in center. Having my players behaving differently than the historical evidence show, is fine with me, as long as we get to explore their inner field of xenophobia. So; to make it clear; this is not a game about cowboys and indians; it's a game focusing on prejudice and xenophobia, and how the players choose to deal with it. I am trying to prepare myself for the encounters, by asking how relations between whites and indians developed (what happened, on the ground, between individuals of the two groups), so I may give he players a chance to measure themselves against some realistic actions/reactions form the orc side.</blockquote>\nThis thread may have been a little different if this was in the opening post.<br/><br/>So the goal is to explore the racism and xenophobia inherent in colonialism, in a somewhat generic situation, using fantasy as an analogy to remove people from the easily taken stance that "Humans are humans, duh... These humans have rights too." Tomas, you seem to have found what I have already stated is a perfect combination to basically trap your players into recreating events similar to the European Invasion of North America.<br/><br/>Were these my goals, I would approach it slightly differently than you have. There are a few elements that I would insist were present, and I would avoid any traps that are easy to fall into that make your scenario problematic for me.<br/><br/>1) Both colonizers and indigenous people need to be "human." This does not mean that they have to be human by fantasy definitions, it means that the things that we think of as humanizing elements in relationships must be present on both sides. It is absolutely necessary for the players to eventually come to the conclusion that both the colonizers and the indigenous people are understandable, and that there are no real villains in this scenario. When there are true bad guys, you eliminate the hard choices and difficult situation that is possible with this scenario. Know both sides well enough that you can sympathize with them before you play them. Make the orcs real to yourself, as a culture and as individual characters, before you bring the into play. Caricatures will not suffice when you want believable feelings. Allow the orcs to love, to be afraid, to be loyal, to have families, to have dreams and ambitions, to laugh, to cry, to have hope, and to be backed into a corner in despair. Make them real people, or the impact of the players killing them will be nil. If you do not make them real people, understandable people, respectable people, you are just perpetuating many hollow memes about indigenous people, and are furthering racism. You can do better than that.<br/><br/>2) Utilizing players' inherent biases will enhance the impact of the scenario. Using orcs is a great idea. In this instance, you can use all that the players come to the table with to really add some punch to the situation. When players assume they know about orcs, then they are doing exactly what most colonialists do with the indigenous people. They bring tons of bias to the table and then justify horrible acts based on these biases. Orcs allow this. Use it. Do not give them easy outs by making them caricatures of easily recognizable real world cultures that have been oppressed. Just make them tribal orcs without the death cult evilness. Make them totemic or something, still scary to the players, but not evil or degenerate. The orcs have to not be degenerate or the truth of the scenario will be lost. The tragedy of colonization is the assumption by the colonizers that the indigenous people are degenerate and have no rights, somehow beneath the colonialists. The orcs have to be deserving of human rights, or there is no impact to the scenario. <br/><br/>3) There is strong danger that you will make the players feel lied to or tricked. Don't allow them to deny the impact that this scenario can have by blaming their actions on you for tricking them. The orcs should not behave in ways that are in any way aberrant/immoral. The orcs do not need to piss on each other, they do not need to act in strange ways. This perpetuates the falsehoods and racism that indigenous people have had to deal with, and provides justification to the players for doing bad things. Explaining to them afterwards that this is how orcs behave in a friendly manner will not change the fact that you had them piss on the player characters. There is no way that anyone can see this as anything but aberrant and aggressive. Don't let the players have this easy cop out. Play the orcs as different, but not aberrant. Do not fall to the seemingly easy choice to create a feeling of "other" by making them degenerate. The players bring enough feeling of "other" with them when you call them orcs. Subtlety is better in this instance.<br/><br/>4) Use lies and misunderstanding to further the animosity that will drive the situation. Make the orcs good and deserving of respect, but make the colonists tell stories of how they are not. Create situations where things are misinterpreted. Maybe a girl is missing at the same time as the orcs are in the area. Maybe a colonist beats his wife to death, then frames the orcs. Maybe some sheep escape and are legitimately hunted down by orcs. Maybe a berry patch is "raided" by the orcs because there is no concept of ownership of plants/animals. These can ramp up aggression between the two peoples. Eventually, some of the more aggressive factions on each side will want to take action. The girl is missing, lets go get her back! Your wife was killed by orcs, lets get revenge! They stole some of your sheep, we should go and arrest the sheep rustlers! These events can cascade. This can only have the tragic impact that you are seeking if it all starts out innocent, but is misinterpreted, or starts out sinister in the form of prejudice and lies that are told to the PCs. The PCs should be allowed to "do the right thing" based on what they hear and what they assume, only to find out that their assumptions lead them to actions of injustice. This will be a difficult trail to walk because you have to make the players feel that YOU have not lied to them, even if they have been lied to.<br/><br/>5) Give the players the opportunity to see things as they are. Never paint the indigenous people as evil or degenerate. They can be aggressive or violent, but this has to be understandable violence or you are back to the tired trope of mindlessly aggressive and violent savages. This will ruin your scenario. The colonialists can see them as degenerate, but make these feelings believable. The colonialists view of the world must be "real" to you. You have to be able to play it straight faced based on what the colonialists "know". But make all this bullshit. The whole point is that racism is easy, believable, but wrong. Anything else reverts to business as usual orc killing.<br/><br/>6) Reveal and play out this scenario over a long time. Too short a time and it will be hard to make it real to the players. It will seem a caricature of all the trite shit that has been talked about in this thread, both the racist shit and the oversensitive liberal PC bullshit. Only time in play will allow you to make this have real meaning, and not be a bunch of preachy crap. Use AW style Announce Future Badness moves to increase tension, to justify future stances and events, to make it real to the players. Make them feel like they have lived it, not that they were told it. <br/><br/>These ideas should get you a long way toward what you want, without falling into the trap of perpetuating the racism inherent in the usual indigenous stereotypes. Use player bias, put the PCs in the middle of a conflict between two equally good peoples, create lies and misunderstanding to justify bad actions, build tension slowly and as a believable consequence of actions that are reasonable to the perpetrators from their perspective, present the truth about the situation as GM while presenting lies about it as the NPCs, and do not let the kettle boil over until the PCs are thoroughly confused about what is right or wrong in this situation. When the players can understand every side and they have interests on every side, make the situation erupt and make them chose. Give them a hard choice. See where things line up, and even give them a chance to argue amongst themselves. If you can pull that off, it will be a campaign of legendary status.<br/><br/>The main pitfalls of this exercise will be creating "facts" in your world out of racist stereotypes, not tapping into real biases but instead leading players astray yourself, and not creating cultures that are truly sympathetic. I am pretty sure that your original presentation will fall victim to each of these.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346257/#Comment_346257" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T19:37:11+00:00" title="October 16, 2011  7:37PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Thunderous applause*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346266/#Comment_346266" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T22:23:52+00:00" title="October 16, 2011 10:23PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2011 11:29PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #CC0033;"><i>(have edited some phrases, on request of the moderator)</i></span><br/><br/>Lee; I marvel at your thoroughness. You give valuable advice, in a way that makes it impossible not to think these things trough. Thanks! <blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite>The main pitfalls of this exercise will be creating "facts" in your world out of racist stereotypes, not tapping into real biases but instead leading players astray yourself, and not creating cultures that are truly sympathetic. I am pretty sure that your original presentation will fall victim to each of these.</blockquote>I am pretty sure this will turn out nice. My presentation of the orcs has left a lot out, and is mostly speculation to what may be. I will certainly take heed of your advice in my interaction.<br/><br/>But I do have an intention of making the orcs a bit repugnant; hard to commune with. A perception that natives were repugnant in their behavior may, or may not, have been a part of what made europeans slaughter africans, indians and asians, and disregard their humanity. Anyway; testing the tolerance of the players is one aspect of this. My players live in a culture where tolerance is politically correct, so this is one way of pushing through the veneer of modern thinking. It seems like you consider this a faulty venue of play, so I'm hoping to be proven right in doing it.<br/><br/>Most "facts" about the orcs is made up in play, inspired by events and interactions. This is a game where players partake in framing scenes, so I have to be flexible in how I develop a central element as the orcs. But to be flexible, and believable at the same time, I need to know stuff. I need to have an inkling of what have been the realities in historical situations similar to the ones I strive to create in my campaigns.<br/><br/>And then; this IS fantasy! I'm not going to make everything "realistic". And I'm not going to bind myself in anxiousness of "doing the wrong thing"; I need to keep an open mind and a soaring spirit to support great game-play. So I will go with the flow, and strive to make the game both serious and funny. Having an orc flirt with a character is one scene I do not want to pass up.

One of Beowulf's companions is a bard who, after each encounter, records the events inaccurately by composing verses which pander to Beowulf's men and slur Grendel.   Beowulf can adhere to the evidence of his own eyes, or let himself be lulled into the pleasing lies of the bard.  There's also a 'whore' who is a 'witch' who Beowulf can either treat humanely, or abuse.   In her case, it is not an orc-ish lack of appeal which makes it tempting to treat her poorly, but rather her appeal.  Beowulf can either regard her as a person, an equal-- or as 'treasure', his to plunder, simply because she's powerless to stop him from doing so.     When Beowulf does exploit her (sexually, and as a pawn against Grendel) the thing Lee is talking-about happens...   Beowulf is exonerated in the eyes of the audience, not because he does much to deserve exoneration; but because he's the Lead Character and we the audience just sorta Want to let him off easy.  We shrug off his crimes.<br/><br/>Another movie, 2011's 'Cedar Rapids', features John C. Reilly as 'Dean Ziegler', an insurance salesman who initially appears...  orc-ish.   But he is revealed to merely be non-sanctimonious.   If I were to portray orcs, I'd make them like him.   Because he's enough like me, that I'm in no danger of Other-ing him.<br/><br/>I think Lee's right that calling 'em "orcs" is Enough.    But, personally, I would still be tempted to include showy stuff like pissing on feet.

There will be genocide. And the players can blame it on you. You are pandering to the stereotype of degenerate natives. It is too easy for us to just fall into this. Your privilege as a white man from a developed country has lead you to a position that will not let you see how this could be both offensive, as well as logically lead to the type of events that lead to genocide of the indigenous North Americans. The Native people were not ACTUALLY repugnant or degenerate. They did not do things that were offensive, or disgusting. It was the set of biases that made them APPEAR repugnant, or more commonly the lies told by power hungry leaders that made them seem degenerate. Most common people had no contact with Natives, yet everyone knew that they were savage, without morals, and that "God" hated them. It was rumor and lies that gave people any knowledge about them at all. By making your Natives ACTUALLY degenerate, and showing this to the players directly, you are making FACTS out of the LIES that were told about real people, my ancestors. Whether the stereotypes that you propagate for your stand-in Natives are the same as the ones that were told about my great great great grandfather makes no difference. You are engaging in the same activity that lead to the fact that I am the only person in my family the EVER go to college, much less gain an advanced degree. Native people were made degenerate by what was said about them. Your Natives are being made repugnant and degenerate as FACTS.<br/><br/>You are taking what are likely stand-in Europeans and pitting them agains stand-in Natives and then making the Natives ACTUALLY degenerate. Then you hope that the players will use their modern sensibilities and choose not to be unjust with the Natives. The problem is that by becoming defensive and angry about getting pissed on, then the players will actually be engaging the scenario in a realistic way, from a modern perspective or otherwise. People deserve human rights, not because we share DNA and despite or degeneracy, we deserve human rights because we are not degenerate, despite how you see us. If you make the Natives degenerate, and the players go on to make the "right" choice and not slaughter them, it is because they saw past your trap and reacted how they "should." They would be reacting in an unrealistic manner, they would not actually be engaging in the scenario. Degenerate, offensive, aggressive behavior present in the orcs is to be expected from our past experience with orcs in gaming culture, and any deviation from the norm of indiscriminate slaughter by the PCs will be because they know the theme of your game will be "make more humane choices than other colonialists", not because it makes sense in the game. If they engage in slaughter, and you later change the game by either telling or showing them that they should have saved these degenerates, or somehow redefining your orcs as people after having shown that they are degenerate, they have every right to disregard your preaching to them. They will not internalize it. It will be hollow.<br/><br/>I will repeat what I have said. Degenerate Natives will logically lead to exactly the outcomes that we have both come to expect in our games as well as the outcomes we have seen in history, and it will be justified, hence not leading to the game that you want. You are looking for bias, not logical reactions to real game facts. Making players think that the Natives are degenerate, without making them degenerate, may lead to the same outcomes, but it will not be justified, and may lead to the game that you want. Allow ugly bias, not ugly facts to drive your game. Creating stand in Natives who are degenerate monsters is offensive and panders to all the stereotypes that still haunt REAL Natives, and is basically another misuse of power and a propagation of racism. Creating stand in Natives who are real people, who the players could really sympathize with if they get to know them, is not offensive, even if it is done in a way that brings in the same biases in the players that the colonialists in history had about the Natives, and really is a cool tool. I am not at all offended about orcs as Natives. I am offended about STEREOTYPED orcs as Natives.<br/><br/>When General Custer was defeated at the Little Big Horn, the women combed the battlefield after the battle. They were looking for survivors and for loved ones lost. When they came to the body of General Custer, they performed a spontaneous ritual that has become famous, at least in Native circles. They took little bone knives and each woman poked an extra set of holes in General Custer's ears. Many Natives believe that a fault of Europeans is that they do not hear very well, because when Native people speak, it is obvious later that what was said fell on deaf ears. So the women made more holes in Custer's ears so that maybe next time, he will be able to hear what the Natives say, and then he would not lead so many to slaughter.<br/><br/>I have said what I feel. What you do with it is up to you. Good luck with your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346288/#Comment_346288" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-17T09:48:30+00:00" title="October 17, 2011  9:48AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2011 7:25PM by Todd_L.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an interview with Melissa Harris-Perry, who describes what happens when an oppressed people integrate stereotypes into their self-image.

Like maybe the orcs have a taste-based reaction to each other that is similar to a pheremone reaction. So by licking someone's face, you get a big dose of those pheremones and you get used to the person. There's a logic there as to how the custom would come about.<br/><br/>Pissing on the feet as flirting is a little weirder. I'd use that more as a sign of "marking territory" than "flirting" - claiming a mate rather than enticing one. Again, going with the smell/taste thing. Now, perhaps in orc society, you initiate a claim in a bold way like that and if the female doesn't agree, she's expected to punch you in the face or perhaps knee you in your junk, which you've just exposed. And if she does so, you're shamed and you leave, (perhaps forcing the issue after failing a claim is unheard of in orc society - if you're going to rape a girl you don't try to claim her first, cause that would be like giving a girl flowers and then raping her, which wouldn't make any sense to them).<br/><br/>The high 5 thing seems like too much of an anachronism. Putting that in makes me think of silly Warhammer 40K orcs, which doesn't help at all. Either that, or it reminds me of crappy stereotypical Indians raising a hand and saying "How." Either way, I don't like it. I'd spend some more time on coming up with greeting gestures. In fact, I'd suggest you come up with a formal greeting gesture and an intimate, friendly one. And make them similar. Have the players witness the intimate friendly gesture first, so if they don't explicitly set out to research the orcs, that's all they know - faux pas in the making.<br/><br/>But my main point is this - there should be some sort of reason behind the odd customs. They should all make a lot of sense, if an anthropologist were to study them, even if they seem weird to someone who hasn't studied the context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346329/#Comment_346329" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-17T16:40:14+00:00" title="October 17, 2011  4:40PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2011 11:28PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #CC0033;"><i>(have edited some phrases, on request of the moderator)</i></span><br/><br/>So many of you are crying out here, and I applaud your engagement. Still; you are in the wrong, in so many ways. Let me try to show you how.<br/><br/>And to those of you supporting me in this; thank you!<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite>If this is the case, I think that you have your answer even before play starts. There will be genocide.</blockquote>Oh, Lee, you go far here, in predicting an outcome of a game you do not know. This goes for the lot of you; you talk big with little knowledge. I'm at a loss to give you the full knowledge of my game, without playing it with you. This lack of real insight on your side, is something you should consider, before being too categorical in your dismissal of the game and its potential. It would be wise to thread a bit more carefully.<br/><br/>I have been kind and given you some background for the game I'm currently running, in four parallel groups. Let me further your knowledge a bit, with some of my experiences so far, in the actual campaigns. We are four sessions into the campaign with all groups by now.  All four groups have come in close contact with the orcs. The orcs have been portrayed as threatening, thieving and violent, and to some extent; repugnant. There has even been some scenes with sexualized behavior, very provocative and direct, that has tested the players peaceful resolve to a very high degree. <br/><br/>I've already said that I'm portraying the orcs with mixed elements. It may be that the orcs being complex, and being portrayed as such in the various encounters, is working, after all. They are repugnant and provocative, but at the same time they are clearly curious about the settlers, and not outright hostile in all encounters. Some trappers has described them as peaceful ("They are really nice people, with great knowledge!"), while others have dscribed them as murderous and thieving bastards ("You can't trust them! Kill them and be done with it!"). There has been most of the latter type, of course, but the signals are mixed, and it seems to be working.<br/><br/>The two groups that have decided to take action, have decided to negotiate with these repugnant and green skinned savages. That is their action; to negotiate a treaty. Killing the orcs seems to be too brutal, too be contemplated as a solution to the growing conflicts. So my players seem to be eager to prove you wrong. <br/><div>*</div><br/>I've been using terms a lot of you consider shocking, to say something about how "savages" has been perceived by our European forefathers. Seems like those terms is something you react very badly too, so I apologize for that. There is no such ban on the use of such words here in Norway, although they are considered harsh here too. The words have been edited now, in earlier posts and here, so as not to disturb any sensibilities un-necessary.<br/><br/>My point is that these words from back then do not paint a very nice picture of how our forefathers thought in these issues. That makes it all the more important to take this into consideration, if we are to understand how natives all over the world were dehumanized in the general discourse. Knowing that our forefathers really meant africans were so dumb they could not rule themselves, tells volumes of what kind of intellectual regime white men lived in. <br/><br/>So, if I want my players to have a taste of being so thoroughly prejudiced, and supported in this by their peers, I have to paint my orcs with thick layers of it.<br/><br/><b>An important point;</b> the orcs are not a different species. They are, in spite of being so blatantly different than us, a certain type of humans. All the fantasy races are, indeed, subsets of humans. So mistreating them is, actually, a fantasy variant of racism. What makes them humans is not their looks, or their ability to be polite by our standards. No! Far from it! They are humans, and worthy of respect, due to their intellect, their emotional capacity, and their social bonds and system. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sodzilla</cite>Making the natives/orcs into teachers of lovely little moral lessons for the whites/players is pretty damn fraught in its own right.</blockquote>Being politically correct is a bore, indeed yes, and especially so in a role-playing game, which hinges on the interaction being unfettered by anything but moral qualms the players may have on behalf their characters. It's a game we're talking about here, an interactive narrative, that may be described as "an exercise in ethics". No need to supply the game-play itself with caveats that makes it harder to explore the premise.<br/><br/>There is no teaching of moral lessons in my games. There is interaction, with choices and consequences, and players having experiences, which they translate to whatever lessons they want. My finger is not raised in any way, and not pointing at what they "should learn". They are quite capable of finding their own way in the interaction, and interpreting it as is. I find that my players regularly make themselves quite complex and nuanced "lessons", based on the games we play.<br/><br/>In general my players seem to enjoy me being direct in how I lay out the consequences of their actions. It may be due to me doing research like this, and thinking through multiple scenarios beforehand.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>Here's an interview with Melissa Harris-Perry, who describes what happens when an oppressed people integrate stereotypes into their self-image.  As in, "if you respect me so little, you think I'm a monster/ then I'll become that monster/ and at least your fear of me will be a substitute for respect"</blockquote>I understand her sentiment fully. I'm not into this to make indians into monsters. If any, I'm aiming at making the players see how easy it is for their characters to become monsters. Try to fathom that.<br/><br/><b>I've had my say here now.</b> Some of you have seen how this really is about to be, adn support me in this. <br/><br/>Some of you are in the wrong, both in your understanding and your conclusions, but that is OK. I hope you are able to see that what you perceived as "toxic", is in fact working very well and doing no damage at all. Quite the contrary.<br/><br/>All of you; thank you for being so engaged! <br/><br/>I've had my advice, and some damn good elements for use in my games, so I'm very thankful.

A fairly widely accepted number is about 50 million, with high estimates being 100-200 million, between both continents.  Some arguments against a very high number for North America is the relative lack of very large settlements.  The largest one in North America was about 30-40,000, Europe had several cities that exceeded that amount by 1600. <br/><br/>Of the seven major crops, I think only one was present, corn, which is a major factor of population growth.  Europe had access to 4 from a very early stage, plus most of the domesticated farm species.  It was their proximity to those animals that helped them develop their immune system as well.<br/><br/>Even at 100 million, that's a pretty large number of people with patches of land being developed.  It's believed that the Black Death, whatever it was, may have come ashore before the English settlers and killed 90-96% of the population, making it the worst epidemic in history.  Many of the major settlements formed by Europeans were essentially built on the ruins and graves of the decimated tribes.  There are journal entries that describe finding moderate sized towns, 2,000+ people, filled with nothing but bones lying about the buildings.  They died so fast, no one was left to bury them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346359/#Comment_346359" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T03:23:59+00:00" title="October 18, 2011  3:23AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite><br/>But, in over-emphasizing the accidental prejudice motive, your game scenario might be overlooking a glaring INTENTIONAL greed motive.

While later in history, horrific things were done to the native peoples of what is today Quebec, in the early stages, the relationships were relatively benign and productive.  The french settlers were a minority and somewhat abandoned by their colonial masters.  The region wasn't considered fruitful by France ("A few acres of snow" is the famous quote by Voltaire), so the settlers were left on their own.  So they were very dependent on the local knowledge of the natives and established more equitable trading relationships, especailly the explorers and fur traders who pushed out farther west from the base settlements.  This happy pairing may well be exaggerated by our own history and it certainly did not last long, but it demonstrates that these relationships were not always ones of exploitation and genocide, at least in the earlier phases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346386/#Comment_346386" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T10:15:51+00:00" title="October 18, 2011 10:15AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>as they made no effort to ascertain the actual behavior of the orcs there was no need for me to play them in a misleading manner.</blockquote>Ah!

It would be fascinated to see if such a development would change the players' attitudes.OK! I'll do a last post here.<br/><br/>I had a session in one of my groups yesterday, and in that session the greed really surfaced, both on my side (with NPCs) and the players side. They planned to seek up the orcs and negotiate a treaty, but before being able to do so, they heard the orc settlement had been massacred by humans. The humans had slaughtered infants, sick and old alike, and everything else alive in the settlement. It was a great tragedy. <br/><br/>Now the humans had built a fort there, one of them calling himself "baron". They expected the barons men to seek them up, claiming taxes from their small farmstead on behalf of his lordship.<br/><br/>Then they heard nothing, until the year later, when a band of bounty hunters came by, heavily armed. They told them the fort had been burnt by the "murderous orcs". The baron barely escaped. That made the count that sent the baron in the first place, put a prize on orcs heads. So now these bounty hunters were out hunting orcs for money. They talked very derogatory about the orcs, which did not suit most of the characters. The characters tried saying that this was the humans fault in the first place, murdering orcs, but was not heard. The spouse (NPC) of one character agreed with the bounty hunters about the "filthy orcs" (a possible matrimonial conflict there, in the making), and one of the characters actually joined the bounty hunters, and set off to earn his treasure in orc heads ...<br/><br/>I find it very interesting to see my players responding to elements such as these, maintaining different attitudes towards the orcs, driving themselves towards disagreements and internal conflicts. I'm excited about these developments, and really wonder where it will all lead.<br/><br/>My four campaigns is really starting to come alive now, with arrows spinning and pointing in a lot of directions, and no certainty to where it will all lead, and how the characters will cope. It is beginning to bubble like a great cauldron of prejudice, hatred, revenge, sympathy, curiosity, fear, greed, love, hard work, births, murders, thievery, orc youths, wild boars, aurochs, wild sheep, hunting, gathering, herding, logging, fishing, orc sexuality, sowing, harvesting, cooking, feasts, deaths, sorrow ...<br/><br/>I had my doubts initially, when embarking on this theme, but it is really growing into something deeply interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346398/#Comment_346398" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T13:55:50+00:00" title="October 18, 2011  1:55PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay, so the players' "side" (i.e. humans) is greedy, but the players themselves have no incentives in that direction?

Since it's Tomas's game, he has a right to say its the latter, that Bilbo invented that story about the One Ring because he wanted to convert Orc-land into fields and pastures.  Tomas is tricking his players, yes, but that's what GMs do.  The cursed sword, the covered pit, the doppledanger.  For all the times that players have been taught to look for evil in everyone else, why shouldn't they spend a little time conemplating the evil in themselves?  Clearly, in a day when people watch modern hollywood movies and know that Indians are Good and that the White Americans who fought them were Evil (really, who will argue with this in Europe?) then you don't get any meaningful ethical dilema by sending out Rush Limbaugh to ask the PCs to kill Pocahontas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a better question might be not whether orcs are truly evil, but: does the range of attitudes towards orcs map to the range of attitudes towards Indians?  There are a number of ways to approach this question, but probably the easiest is sex.  After clearing out an orc lair, there's often a question about what to do about the non-combatants.  I have never ever heard it suggested that some of the females should go back to The Keep on the Borderlands to see if one of the hundreds of unattached soldiers would like a wife.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I've found that the best way to explore real human conflicts is to cast the humans as humans.  It's easy to tell yourself that you'd do the right thing when you're watching a movie and Kevin Costner is there to show you, but if you get into character you may often find youself thinking, "I shouldn't have ever come here in the first place, but I've got nothing to go back to now and no money, and maybe these guys are turning out to be murderers, but they said they'd protect me and anyway they know my family now and . . . "  So, I don't think the slight of hand is necessary.  And, yeah, it is offensive to say, "Tell me more about indians so I can make my orcs more believable."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346514/#Comment_346514" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T00:42:31+00:00" title="October 20, 2011 12:42AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My answers to you, Brian, is given in a new thread on "Emotional content".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brayo" title="brayo"><img alt="brayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brayo">brayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346522/#Comment_346522" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T05:09:29+00:00" title="October 20, 2011  5:09AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: TomasHVMMy answers to you, Brian, is given in a new thread on "Emotional content".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my answer to you is given in a new thread on "Changing the subject."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346539/#Comment_346539" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T11:17:07+00:00" title="October 20, 2011 11:17AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2011 11:28AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: brayo</cite>Personally, I've found that the best way to explore real human conflicts is to cast the humans as humans.</blockquote>That's what I do.

Why did so many become so brutal? What kind of mechanisms were at work in the society, to support this?</blockquote>I think this is one of the more crucial questions for making this game meaningful and useful.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear from anyone with a historical understanding of this.<br/><br/>Were the settlers simply scumbags by our standards?  If you're an outcast or criminal fleeing Europe who's been beaten by his father and seen eccentrics hanged as witches, you may have a pretty amoral, might-makes-right take on life.<br/><br/>Or were the settlers people we might like, but they were whipped into frenzied states of desperation and fear by misinformation and pressures from governments, churches, mayors, elders, starvation, or other factors?<br/><br/>The scope of atrocities is wide enough that I'd imagine they were committed by all types, from the sociopathic to the misled to the hopeless to the coerced.  If I was to proceed from ignorance, that's what I'd try to model.  But I hope you can get some real info on this stuff, Tomas.<br/><br/>Well, I suggested "Big Chief Elizabeth: to Thomas because it discusses precisely why vqarious people did various specific acts of violence, but, to move onto a broader context, I see two flaws in Tomas's model:<br/><br/>I do not believe at any time that there has ever been a colony anywhere that wanted to be left alone.  Most colonies wanted to trade with the natives, because it is trade in these exotice goods which allows the importation of the agricultural tools the colonists cannot make themselves. What's the point of a colony if it can't give you something a new village next to your lands at home could give you? (Raleigh thought there was gold or iron near his settlements: he didn't go there for maize.  When that turned out not to be true, the settlers were lucky and found tabacco instead, and much rejoicing was had by all the something that grows like a weed in America and not very well in England could be sold home.)<br/><br/>As a general principle, people who are harmed believe that they must demonstrate to the other side that they should not be harmed any more, or they will retaliate.  They cannot clearly distinguish who to punish, and so they punish generically on the basis that if you, say, shoot people in a market in Afghanistan, the people who see you do it will understand it was because some fellow shot one of your chaps (see, I'm doing Kipling, it has nothing to do with Americans!) and will not, themselves, say "Well, we don't know which guy did it, so we'll just pay back one of theirs and they'll work out that it was in exchange for the market thing."  This is pretty much what the early colonists do, despite being told by the King and their financial backers, and Raleigh, not to do this.    <br/><br/>After the many, many other things I'm working on are done, I'd like to do a game about failing colonies.  People seem to think they work, but that's because we tend to live in the ones that worked out.  Between America saying "No more convicts for us." and Sydney being founded, the British tried over and over to found some on the African Coast.

Being the lesser of two evils gave them comfort.  It also justified the US saving the Southwest from the Mexicans. <br/><br/>Later, I learned about Pop\xe9's rebellion-- how the Pueblos banded-together and evicted the Spaniards from New Mexico.  One detail I seized upon, was that the Isleta Pueblo 'sided with the Spanish.'  I chose to believe that this meant the Spanish must not have been absolute villains, if one pueblo took their side.  I based my conclusion on... nothing. Maybe it's true.  I never jeopardized my hypothesis by researching it.<br/><br/>My ancestors' land was part of the "Bloodless Reconquest".   Which, as the story is usually told, consisted of the Spanish returning more humbly and respectfully, trading and intermarrying with the Indians, rather than subjugating... and thus the second colonization was tolerated.<br/><br/>Does that sound familiar?  It's damn-near identical to Tomas's Orcs'n'Settlers scenario.<br/>That's why I gave Tomas a link to Pop\xe9's Rebellion, earlier in this thread.   <br/><br/>I like Lee's responses, because they made me re-examine my own bullshit:<br/>Even wikipedia notes that the 'bloodless reconquest' was bloodless-- because, even having won in the uprising, the Indians then faced a seven year drought, infighting between the Pueblos, raids from nomadic tribes, the destruction of Zia pueblo by a Spanish raid... so that they were too weak to mount a successful revolt, after the reconquest.    It's easy to be nicer to the Indians, when they're so weakened you don't even need to kick their ass, in order to invade.<br/><br/>I think this thread is a good one.  It taught me something.  Which is more than I can say for those who, in trying to be sensitive, would have dodged the topic altogether, convinced they already know everything that needs to be known.<br/> <br/>EDIT: shorter now, less bitchy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347560/#Comment_347560" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T12:36:19+00:00" title="November  1, 2011 12:36PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2011 12:42PM by Bryan.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hesitated to comment on this thread, but nobody really mentioned that the North American invasion and the genocide is still occurring. Thomas may or may not realize this. As an example, it's worth listening to the NPR Talk of the Nation show, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/31/141872944/improving-foster-care-for-native-american-kids" rel="nofollow">Improving Foster Care for Native American Kids</a>.<br/><br/>I currently live near a Native American reservation and lived near Rosebud in the past, and I can tell you that everything isn't well in white America and native relations, many perceived stereotypes and assumptions about humanity remain. It's not hard for me to see how these nuances wouldn't translate well to a game, but if you've never lived on the edge of a reservation, you might not understand the nuances, understand the fact that the invasion continues, and you might not understand how sickening it is to see the results of the North American genocide. Coming from this perspective, it's hard to see how someone could use Orcs to represent an aboriginal population subject to slaughter by NPCs and possibly PCs, especially when using actual events from the North America's history.<br/><br/>Anyway, Thomas, I hope your campaign works out, and I hope that you can use it to learn a bit about American cultural sensitivity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_347564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347564/#Comment_347564" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T15:11:33+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  3:11PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2011 3:49PM by TomasHVM.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bryan; I have posted on the aftereffects of the discrimination the sami people were subjected to.

The bitterness of old women, left to fend for their children without the support of proud, working men. The legacy of self hurting brutality, internal harassment and widespread raping of young girls. The feelings of inferiority when confronted with the spite and scorn of their classmates, the teachers and other people in the community. <br/><br/>I have no problem imagining the same, and worse, taking place in indian cultures.

I have my doubts that the average user of Story Games understands more. It seems like the historical and present plight of the indian is largely ignored by their fellow countrymen. I believe this is a problem you should turn your attention towards. It is symptomatic that it takes a curious Norwegian to make the indians plight an issue on an American site, when this site is, in fact, dedicated to making games on all sorts of human conflicts. <br/><br/>Here's a conflict, a theme, an issue, a living hurt, that screams to be taken seriously! It screams for you to treat it with courage, designing serious games that may be part of helping the issue to a positive close.<br/><br/>I hope you do everything you can, Bryan, to help resolve this issue between people in your nation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347565/#Comment_347565" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T15:28:19+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  3:28PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great post, Todd. Very well put. Thanks.<br/><br/>Bryan, let me explain how I see this thread, and maybe you will understand why I don't think Tomas is using Orcs to represent an aboriginal population. If you think there's an important difference I'm overlooking, that's cool, fill me in. I promise to listen attentively.<br/><br/>Imagine you want to run a game about how years of conflict can poison the mind. You imagine a war of many centuries between Trolls and Dwarves, and your central NPC is an ancient Troll matriarch who hates all Dwarves with an abiding passion because she has lost so many of her descendants to the conflict. You imagine her very well, but you wonder whether people's real-life experiences of war might help to inform your story.<br/><br/>So you come to Story Games, and you start a thread asking whether anyone has stories of the bitterness and prejudice born of war and propaganda. And I recognise this theme at once. I tell you all about my late grandmother, who was born at the end of WWI and saw her young husband go off to fight in WWII. He came home safely but not before witnessing the horrors of the concentration camps. Although a kind and thoughtful person, she could never accept the idea that Germans were ordinary people just like her, and that most of them, just like everywhere in the world, were very nice people. She found the subject very difficult to discuss, probably because on one level she knew it was true, but on another level the word "German" was inexorably linked to death and cruelty. Sadly perhaps, I never managed to introduce her to a real live German, and she took her prejudices with her to the grave. I have quite a few anecdotes to share with you.<br/><br/>You thank me politely for my contribution, and say that some of this will be very helpful. On the other hand, some of it won't be so relevant, because your NPC is an elderly Troll who hates and fears Dwarves, but that can't be helped.<br/><br/>At this point, all hell breaks lose. People are aghast that you would compare my grandmother to a Troll, because Trolls are ugly, unhygienic and have very bad table manners, not to mention a lack of moral fibre. Debate ensues over exactly how offensive this is, and some people kindly explain to you that perhaps you are unaware that calling my grandmother a Troll is offensive, but that you really should apologise for saying such a thing. Others just tell you that your ideas suck and leave. <br/><br/>You try to tell people that your game is not about my grandmother, that you understand entirely why someone might be offended at having their grandmother called an ugly Troll, but you are not doing that, and their concerns are entirely misplaced. People interpret this as the typically arrogant behaviour of someone who doesn't even know how offensive their ideas are. <br/><br/>At some point you and I talk it over, and I realise what you are really trying to do. I start a different discussion with you about whether your game ideas will actually work, although I'm shooting in the dark rather, as it would be hard for you to explain *exactly* what you have in mind short of writing a massive essay on the topic. Your lack of interest in my ideas about how you could better run your game (which you never actually asked for) is interpreted by the wider community as further evidence of your horrible arrogance, and the fact that our discussion has moved on from grandmother=Troll is generally ignored.<br/><br/>To cap it all, Chris Chinn writes an intelligent, carefully thought-out blog post in which he calls you a closet Nazi and a poster boy for all that is wrong with RPGs.<br/><br/>The only important differences that I can see between this imaginary thread and the one we're posting in are that the real thread is far more tangled, with much more possibility for misunderstanding, that you would probably manage to explain yourself more clearly than Tomas has, and that roleplayers have a very real history of racial insensitivity at times, but no great track record of insulting my late grandmother. Still, as a description of the *kinds of confusion* that have arisen, I think it's a pretty good parallel.<br/><br/>What do you think?

For example, the reservation set up a charter school here that focuses on an environmental education with an emphasis on native culture. It's a good deal for kids on the reservation. I have a friend who lives on the reservation who laments not learning his tribe's language or having that kind of opportunity when he was growing up. But many of the whites in the area, including a prominent millionaire and local business owner, don't think it's a good idea, because "the school doesn't integrate the kids into the 'regular' American culture," which they see as the only valid culture in America. I can't speak to the feelings of Norwegians about the Sami, but this is an oft repeat theme throughout the world when the colonial nations invaded.\n<blockquote>It seems to me the average American is lacking in understanding of this issue.  I have my doubts that the average user of Story Games understands more. It seems like the historical and present plight of the indian is largely ignored by their fellow countrymen. </blockquote>\nThere's no doubt about that. Most think that the issue is resolved. Here's the deal though, Americans aren't necessarily fellow countrymen. Yes, Native Americans are Americans, but they're also sovereign nations with treaty rights that are often violated. Most Americans that I've talked to about this, think the treaties aren't needed anymore or are too antiquated and should be done away with. It's a raw deal. Certainly, people, including myself when I can, are working to improve and communicate the problems.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that the issue needs to be taken seriously, and if you're into exploring genocide inside a game, then do it. I just brought up my points to point out the problems that I see in this thread:<br/><br/>* When you bring up a hot button issue with current culture implications, you're going to get push back. You should expect that. Maybe you didn't understand that it's still an issue.<br/>* That the questions you asked in your OP are still happening.<br/>* Using a evil fantasy creature that is always portrayed as less-than-human or as a demon or as a monster, such as Orcs, can drift your well-intentioned ideas into an actual still held racist belief system, especially when blending it with actual historic events.<br/><br/>Those are my opinions, and I just wanted to communicate them to you because I'm sure you're a good guy and I'm not sure that you understood why you were getting stomped on or why some people might be offended by the use of Orcs in this context.<br/><br/>Hopefully, Dave, I answered your questions, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347652/#Comment_347652" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T12:11:55+00:00" title="November  2, 2011 12:11PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bryan, I must admit I was hoping for more from you.
