We need to step up and help him make this such a success Gencon will keep taking care of us.  <br/><br/>Check out the <a href="http://www.indiegamesexplosion.org/2012/03/19/gen-con-2012-ige-games-on-demand/" rel="nofollow">Indie Games Explosion/Games on Demand</a> announcement.\n<blockquote>Games on Demand is back for Gen Con 2012, and this year we\u2019ve made some modest improvements to the format that are going to make it even more fun for everyone.<br/><br/>The event will be held in the Convention Center on the upper floor overlooking the Exhibitor hall. We\u2019ll have our own 12 table room, giving us twice the space we had last year, in a more central location. To make best use of the space, we\u2019ll be splitting the tables into both standard Games on Demand open gaming and scheduled games, taking tickets for both as we did last year (1 specific or generic ticket / 2 hour slot).<br/><br/>If you\u2019re interested in running scheduled games or volunteering to GM open games or help facilitate GoD, let us know. Volunteers and GMs who put in enough hours will get comped badges (and maybe a place to sleep). In addition, Indie Press Revolution and possibly other vendors will be offering discounts for GMs and players.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
