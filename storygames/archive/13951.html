I just grabbed Fiasco as my very first RPG (yep I've never played any RPG, let alone a 'Story Game'). Well it looks fantastic, lots of creativity, very little number crunching, which was exactly what I was looking for. I'm planning to give it a shot this weekend (hopefully) with a bunch of folks who are also new to RPG's. So far, I'm pretty clear on how the game works, but I'm not exactly sure how to handle the scenes. I've listened to a couple of actual play podcasts and it seems like some folks actually act the thing out as if it were a play, while others sort of take turns narrating as if it were a story. I'm hesitant to suggest improv to new gamers that might be a little self-conscious about it, so I'm leaning toward a more narrative style that allows us to take turns telling the story. But the book itself implies (in its play example) that the game will be played in a more improv-theater manner. I also feel that--and let me say this just might be the writer in me talking--that a narrative approach would lend itself to a more stable and focused story, especially for a group of first-timers. I have these nightmare visions of pointless and wandering 'in-character' dialogue and dead-ends. Who knows though, I haven't played it yet. I'm just trying to get an idea of how to best approach the game-play with totally new players.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, given the usual caveats about the nature of any given group and the like, how do you all play? Either/or? Both? Does one style or the other obtain a better story? How about other games? Is there something about Fiasco that is more suitable for improv-theater style play as opposed to more traditional fair? Are the so-called Story-Games as a whole better for one style of play or another?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316021/#Comment_316021" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T10:41:14+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 10:41AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both work pretty well, I switch it up a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316022/#Comment_316022" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T10:44:30+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 10:44AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the Fiasco play I've seen has been 80% improv, only breaking into third-person voice to describe action or motion.

I slam him against the wall!" Sometimes I want to Say Something, sometimes I want to Be There.

In more action-y scenes, describing from a third person style is more natural. If you're in a fight or chase or the like, it seems a bit weird to constantly be speaking in character describing everything that happens.  Some Fiasco games wind up with a lot of talking and personal, emotional betrayals.  Some games wind up a frantic, madcap chase across the city as you desperately fight for your life.

I think you're really talking about voice, right? First person vs. third person? Me vs. my guy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I'm not sure if that is quite the distinction I wanted make. I'm thinking more about being 'in-character'. I could see still using a first person voice "So then I walk into the the room and, can you believe, Bob has a shotgun pointed at the priest..." and it being narrative. The distinction I'm trying to make is maybe a little indefinite; maybe acting vs narrating. So for example, I can get in character and ask "Bob what the hell are you doing with that gun?" and expect a response from someone playing Bob in character, or I could say "So I ask Bob what he's doing for the gun, and then he says..." or "...what would Bob say", looking for input from the other players. So maybe the distinction I'm going for is in-character vs. out? I think I'm probably splitting hairs though because I've never played this type of game before. It is pretty likely that the game will just develop organically, as we go along. I'm just hesitant to encourage people to get 'in-character, and act things out because I'm a little worried about he response I might get. You are right though, using the word 'Imrpov' just confuses the issue. I certainly don't imagine people playing the game by actually getting up and acting things out beyond the table, but a couple of the podcast replays I've heard have a theatrical, in-character vibe mixed with discussions about narrative possibilities--though with the majority of the gameplay being 'in-character'. It sounds like a lot of people sort of naturally go back and forth between the two, which make sense to me; I certainly hope that happens as my group gets comfortable with what's going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316032/#Comment_316032" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T11:18:29+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 11:18AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2011 11:22AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, sorry, I misunderstood.

I don't think people need any encouragement one way or the other - you and your friends will find your own tempo and preferences, and chances are the urge to drop into character will become overwhelming at some point - that's pretty fun. If you start to play and for some reason it isn't coming naturally, you can stop and talk about it. My guess is that it'll go swimmingly without too much prompting. I think it is super cool that you're giving it a try!<br/><br/>I'd think more about facilitation as something you can do to make the game better - keep an eye on pacing (help bring those talky, going nowhere scenes to a gentle conclusion), the flow of dice (remind everybody their scenes are sharply limited and to use them directly and wisely, ideally pointed straight at Needs), and being a good listener so that when you get to Establish for others (sometimes people choose to Resolve a lot when they are new to the game) you'll be ready with some juicy scenes to throw out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316038/#Comment_316038" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T11:39:03+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 11:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>[...]remind everybody their scenes are sharply limited[...]</blockquote> This is the most important fact about Fiasco, I think.

(e.g. "Bob leans forward and grabs the gun!")<br/>* If your character is saying something, say it yourself, like an actor would. ("Oh, hello! Where do you think you're going?") <br/><br/>You can add body language cues, if you like, like leaning forward, making a grimace, rubbing your hands together, etc, but most people remain sitting when they play.<br/><br/>In play, you'll switch between the two, often even in the same sentence. Say you're playing a character named Jeff. You might say something like: <br/><br/>"My, it's getting cold in here!" Jeff shivers a little as he is speaking, and his lips are blue. "Did anyone bring some matches?"<br/><br/>Many people will use a slightly different "character voice" to make it clear that the first part was character dialogue and the phrase in the middle was not. It's much easier than having to specify "So, then my character says..." every time Jeff speaks a line in the story.<br/><br/>Hope that helps! Let us know how the game goes.<br/><br/>I think studying the "replay" in the text will be really helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316042/#Comment_316042" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T12:02:49+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 12:02PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2011 2:00PM by Todd_L.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Fiasco-- there's the initial setting-of each scene, which defaults-toward third person; especially when setting a scene for another player.<br/><br/>When I have a really juicy idea, I tend to stay in third person, speak quickly, &amp; narrate all the characters around like pawns, gloating aloud at what a brilliant idea I've had to steer the characters up shit creek.  "<i>So... it's the next morning.  Jimmy Olsen wakes up, and wonders where his pants are!"</i><br/><br/>If I can think of a way to say the same thing in first person, I go for it.  Because doing that seems to get a big laugh out of the other players.<br/><i>"My turn? OK. ahem. [looking upward with forearm across my eyes] Fucking sunlight. What time is it?  Dawn? And... Where Are  My Pants?!?"</i>   But often my acting skillz don't extend beyond one liners, so I switch back to storytelling mode.<br/><br/>If any player, in third person, makes suggestions to make my idea even better-- I try to find a way to incorporate it into my idea. But I don't hesitate  to hash-it-out player-to-player  (rather than character-to-character), if I think there's a good reason Not to do it their way.  This is different from theatre Improv, where they teach actors to say "Yes, and" or "Yes, but" but not "No-- that's not what happens."<br/><br/>On the other hand, if I'm setting a scene, and somebody jumps in-- and starts adding to it in-character, in<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> first person</span>; then I'm more likely to defer to whatever they're doing, even if it isn't what I had in mind.   Because-- I see 'acting' as a delicate thing, and if somebody is brave enough to give it a try, I want to do all I can to help them not-crash.<br/><br/><br/>For me, the really-thorny part of acting-mode is prolonged dialogue. Often, I'll intentionally not-even-try to act out dialogue. If I know it's beyond my limits.  If I'm playing a girl out on a date, I'll tend toward, "Betty says this, and then she does that", to spare everyone the awful spectacle of me trying to impersonate a teenage seductress.  I do this, even if the other player is in-character.  They act their dialogue in character, I reply with "She does this..." or even "I do that" but not actual dialogue, beyond a few phrases.<br/><br/><br/>One time when I do make a point of going into character-- is when I can't think of a good idea for where the scene should go.  It can be uncomfortable to fish-around in-character, haltingly thinking up dialogue on the fly.  But sometimes you gotta just inhabit a scene to see if something gets said-- which would make a good 'point' for the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ally%20Nauss" title="Ally Nauss"><img alt="Ally Nauss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ally%20Nauss">Ally Nauss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316044/#Comment_316044" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T12:07:08+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 12:07PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually do a little of both. For me, interaction between characters is best improved (both players in character) while interaction between character and environment is best narrated (I.e. Describing an explosion, the creaking of an old stairway, the smell of the greasy burger joint). <br/>\n<br/>\nNewer players may feel more comfortable narrating (take a look at Prime Time Adventures for this type of gameplay), as though they are writing a TV show or movie. One thing that I find helps in getting people to interact more is when a person says "I do this", ask them to show you how they are doing it. Are they excited, hurried, dragging their feet? What about the tone of their voice? Their body language? Once players get the hang of expressing their character, it quickly becomes addictive :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
