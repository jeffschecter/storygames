We had some general ideas before we met but we basically created the show concept, made characters, clarified a couple rules and played both the pilot episode and the first episode of our season in under five hours.  The budget only lasted long enough such that each show was under two hours.<br/><br/>I was basically okay with the pacing, and wouldn't mind eight more episodes played at a similar pace over four sessions to give us a nine episode season.  But we collectively decided we want to try to slow things down for our next session so that we play the remaining four episodes in four sessions of play.  We have some ideas on how we are going to do this, which include having scenes where there is no conflict, extending the time we spend in dialogue and scene narration and making sure we get the Fan Mail dispersed early and often.<br/><br/>I am just curious whether others have had a similar issue with running out of Budget.  When you're producing a game of PTA, do you often spend 1 Budget (two cards) in the Conflict, or do you often spend more?  If you almost always spent 1 Budget there would be at least 15 scenes with conflict which would easily fill up a standard length play session.<br/><br/>I also have embarrassingly basic math question about conflict odds and ask with the intent of helping us find the right pace.  If a Producer spends 1 Budget (two cards) and comes up against a Screen Presence 1, 2 or 3 Protagonist who is using a Trait to give them an extra card (2, 3, and 4 cards respectively) are the odds of the Producer winning 50%, 40%, and 33.3% respectively, or is it more complicated than that?<br/><br/>If my odds breakdown is correct, given the severity of some of the Stakes that are put up, even a spotlight character has only a 66.6% chance of winning their Stakes against a Producer that is taking it easy on them.  This seems to me to be  be scary enough to  provide a lot of interest and uncertainty over which way the plot is going to go.<br/><br/>What are your impressions/experience?  The rules say that most scenes should involve conflict.  What have you found to be a good sweet spot for the ratio of scenes that have a conflict?  51%, 99%, or somewhere in between?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119258/#Comment_119258" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-12T21:07:01+00:00" title="January 12, 2008  9:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I've played (mainly one-shots), we'd have maybe 60-80% of the scenes have a conflict. We wouldn't shoot for a conflict, it just naturally happened that the scenes didn't have a conflict in them to resolve. There really were no complaints about the non-conflict scenes.<br/><br/>When producing, I usually start off with a large amount of budget just to seed the Audience Pool and not worry about the amount of budget left. For the amount I'll throw in, it depends on how interesting the "and if I fail" side of the stakes are. If the episode looks like we're running out of Budget and it doesn't feel like we're at the end of the episode, I tell the players to start throwing in Fan Mail to possibly extend the episode. <br/><br/>Sure, you can have a player hoard Fan Mail to carry over to the next episode, but I'd like to keep the amount they can carry down to a small amount. There's no rule that limits the amount they can carry over (or is there? /me flips through the rulebook quickly), but I'd suggest a limit on unspent Fan Mail that carries over to something like three points, which would motivate them into throwing more Fan Mail into conflicts, which would end up lengthening the game session. And here, I'm not sure if players keeping excessive Fan Mail is affecting your game or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119260/#Comment_119260" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-12T21:22:21+00:00" title="January 12, 2008  9:22PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matthew,<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo hours seems amazingly short.

None of us have any left over going into Episode 2.  Having lots of Fan Mail or a little wouldn't seem to me to matter much - your Producer still gets their full Budget at the beginning of an episode.  None of us were trying to "starve" the  Producer, but it seems natural to use your Traits first if they are applicable to the scene, which means you don't really need to spend your Fan Mail to have a decent chance of winning.  Some of us used our Fan Mail to help the Producer's side against another Protagonist in an effort to get the Producer more budget.  It wasn't enough.<br/><br/>I suspect the main issue was that we were having almost all of our scenes have conflict and we plan to try to remedy that.<br/><br/>The other thing at play is that as co-writers of what we hope to be a compelling drama, we are all happy to have our protagonists load up on the difficulties, particularly in the early episodes.  That means we aren't inclined to win our Stakes so we don't feel any impulse to spend our Fan Mail helping our characters out.  Thus, it has no chance of going back into the Budget...  Maybe we'll approach them with a more "My Guy" attitude in this next episode.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119265/#Comment_119265" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-12T21:38:08+00:00" title="January 12, 2008  9:38PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>Two hours seems amazingly short.</blockquote>\nThat's about the length of my PTA games. We've had games with four protagonists all with Screen Presence 2 in a few games and games as a three episode mini-series with two protagonists. All of them wound up clocking in at the two to two and a half hour mark of television show time. Our pitch sessions seem to fall around forty-five minutes. Scenes tend to be awfully short and we have about... I'm guessing eight or nine conflicts in an episode. (I'm not too certain about the number of conflicts.)<br/><br/>In the last game I ran, we had two protagonists and ran two episodes of a three-episode miniseries. Jason's screen presence was 312, Peter's was 132. Pitch was about a half-hour and we ran the two episodes and I'm pretty sure we had a bit of time left at the end of the four hour slot. Both of those episodes were *packed* with television goodness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119289/#Comment_119289" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-13T07:23:05+00:00" title="January 13, 2008  7:23AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was highly badass. I was very wicked. Ahem. Anyway, there's one thing that everyone is overlooking in this back-of-envelope calculation, which is that spent Fan Mail comes back to the Producer half the time. And this is the one thing about pacing PTA that drives me crazy. When I'm Producing, and I think, "Yes, this is a great climactic scene!" and I wipe out the Budget....and then I end up getting 1-2 more chips back from Fan Mail. And then we come to another great climactic scene and I wager those...and I get another chip back. I'm often floundering for how and why to continue the episode! If I had a regular PTA group, I might just make a house rule that any time the Producer spends his last chip, he may call it the last scene in the episode no matter if he gets budget back or not.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a lot of Fan Mail hoarding, but that's because I haven't run a full season with anyone yet. I think starting out an episode with a nice bank of Fan Mail would make things really fun for a lot of people. Especially if this was an ep where you had low screen presence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119290/#Comment_119290" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-13T07:55:43+00:00" title="January 13, 2008  7:55AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has Matt (Wilson) ever explained anywhere why half of the fanmail goes back into the budget?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119292/#Comment_119292" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-13T08:55:48+00:00" title="January 13, 2008  8:55AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Otherwise you run out of budget, Christian, in my experience.

Basically, I used a lot of budget first because I wanted to start out hosing the characters so they could recover later, plus I needed to put some tokens in the audience pool. But then I couldn't pace well, because I didn't know if I was going to run out soon or not. Like JD said.<br/><br/>Maybe I just haven't played it enough yet to get a feel for how it all works. I'll pay some attention to that tonight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119300/#Comment_119300" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-13T09:38:37+00:00" title="January 13, 2008  9:38AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the economics take a while to get used to and they don't always seem to support certain styles of pacing.  A good thing to remember, I think, is that PTA is basically the "Joss Whedon roleplaying game," so Whedonesque pacing is the best supported.  You probably can't win a conflict against all the players in the early game, but you can totally win a conflict against one or two players, have them kidnapped by the bad guys, and then have the other characters come rescue them, or stuff like that.<br/><br/>Or, remember that you can just negotiate things out with the players or get one of the players to describe their complete failure (probably for fanmail).  Like, if the players "get" (whether because you told them or because they're really feeling the style of game you're after) that they should lose, you should have no problems.  <br/><br/>Honestly, I really dislike having to strategically maneuver my way through mechanics to get to the story that I want.  I feel like that's just takes me back into System Doesn't Matter territory, where I want to throw the game book across the room and freeform it, because the rules are hindering the group instead of leading us to more interesting results than we would have gotten on our own.<br/><br/>So... I guess my advice is, if it unquestionably is going to make the session better, cheat.  Of course, it's hard to know in advance whether it will or not, until you've played it straight for a while, but sometimes a little cheating can salvage a mediocre session.  Like if you've gotten to the end of the episode and the group is all prepared for the big fight... but you have no budget left...  I would just grab a handful of cards and throw down anyway.  Because, what the hell, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119301/#Comment_119301" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-13T09:53:15+00:00" title="January 13, 2008  9:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since the order is 1) Producer sets difficulty, then 2) Protagonists apply Traits and spend Fan Mail, I could see some scenes going down like this:<br/><br/>Christian: "I'll spend no budget (one card).

But it's fuzzy. You don't have to bitterly play scene after scene, hoping to hit zero budget so you can end the episode. That's crazy talk.<br/><br/>It's like this: "I still have a lot of budget left. Let's do more in this episode." Or, "I spent most of my budget, let's wrap this one up in the next scene." That's all there is to it.<br/><br/>I spend max budget on every conflict until I can't. Then it's usually time to wrap it up. The amount of real-world time spent on an episode almost never matters. What matters is that you deal with the issues that need dealing with. Forcing things by trying to make an episode shorter or longer just for time's sake is totally unnecessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119366/#Comment_119366" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-13T20:29:00+00:00" title="January 13, 2008  8:29PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only reason it works as a pacing mechanism is because it's a resource and I'm allocating it.

An episode will take us about 90min-2 hours, and we typically played two episodes back to back.<br/>2. We sometimes ended the episode with as much as 5 points worth of budget.<br/>3. The pacing trick of budget is fan mail. If players are engaged about what is going on, they'll give and spend fan mail. By spending fan mail, they expand the budget, so the game lasts longer. If the players aren't engaged, the budget supply will run out fast, and the episode ends quickly. Good games last longer - mediocre games end quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119499/#Comment_119499" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T14:18:47+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  2:18PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For our 2nd episode of No Man's Land last night we played about 3 and a half hours and about half of our scenes had conflict.  Most of the scenes that did not have conflict were relatively short, but some of them were longer.  The pacing felt more comfortable, and I didn't feel anything was missing or dragging for those scenes without conflict.  We were fleshing out the plot and the characters along the way, and having some interesting dialogue - much like a TV show.<br/><br/>We ended the show with a bit of Budget left at what seemed an appropriate scene - a funeral.<br/><br/>I don't have a strong opinion, either as a player or as someone who thinks about design, about Budget as a pacing mechanism.  I do have some thoughts about the "lack" of dials that PTA (along with a lot of other designs I admire) has.  I say this as someone who is most comfortable with FATE, a system (culture?) which has these dials.  I may or may not post something about that elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone for your input.  I think we arrived somewhere very close to what works for us as a group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119517/#Comment_119517" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T16:08:27+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  4:08PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2008 4:30PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we were playing PTA (badly, I might add -- under no circumstances should anyone mistake me for someone who has the slightest idea how to make PTA work properly), I seem to remember that the Producer was working pretty hard to get all the Budget spent by the end, resulting in a final big conflict followed by a scattering of tiny denoument-type scenes.  If I step back from our actual play experience and just look at the structure of that, it's actually a pretty good model for an ongoing TV show.  You've got the show's climax, and then a little coda tacked on the end that maybe hints at something that will carry over into another show.<br/><br/>Then again, I could easily see someone accomplishing the same goal <i>without</i> focusing on emptying the Budget.  (Carrying leftover Budget into a new episode seems okay with me.  If you really want a TV-production analogy for it, it's basically like getting to re-use props or sets, or filming episodes concurrently.  Or the kind of deal where if you stay on the soundstage for this episode, you can afford to go out on location in the next!)<br/><br/><br/>And to weigh in on the conflict-to-scene ratio, our games were slavishly 1:1 and I think that was one of the reasons why they weren't much good.  The flow of play kept getting derailed by people trying to figure out a good conflict: if we'd just gone with what felt right for each particular scene with no "so, what's the conflict here?" thoughts, things might've gone slightly better.  Not <i>well</i>, of course, but at least it would've been closer to something we're good at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121030/#Comment_121030" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T14:14:40+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:14PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played PTA I had some awkwardness problems with the Budgetpartially because we had a hard time getting the fanmail thing to kick in. players weren't earning or spending fanmail a whole lot, and when they DID spend points, the luck of the draw tended NOT to put the point back into the Budget pool. We also had some problems with conflicts; I was pushing for conflict every scene where the others were often "eh, no conflict here, let's just move on." I think we were both right--we needed stronger conflict in the game, but we also could have stood to let scenes develop organically, to explore the characters and issues at a natural pace and give conflict <i>time</i> to grow. By the final episode we'd hit a good stride and had a satisfying finish, but the steps toward that were faltering.<br/><br/>I often found that it was tricky to time the Budget for a nice climactic 6 card throw-down at the end, but I think with a more robust Fanmail economy I could have spent consistently more Budget and gained more return, enabling me to relax about that timing a bit.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121041/#Comment_121041" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T14:52:02+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:52PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our PTA game last year, we had an interesting inversion of the usual conflict dynamics. Players would induce the Producer into spending Budget so as to get access to fanmail. As the Producer, I didn't have to worry about creating conflicts; the players created them for me. If I thought it would be interesting them for them to fail or if I really wanted to narrate, I'd spend Budget. I never worried about using it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
