We cover our experience with Burning Empires' learning curve, Duels of Wits, and Fire Fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have settled into our format of summary of fiction, general discussion, player focused discussion, and finally GM focused discussion.  This episode runs for 31 minutes.  Our target length for the show is 30 minutes, so you should expect most future episodes to be approximately the same length.<br/>\n<br/>\nA slight word of warning, I had to remove some noise during the first couple minutes of this episode.  A side affect of doing this is the audio is slightly distorted during that time.  The audio clears up after minute two.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinks:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.burningwheel.org/" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel HQ</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.archaiasp.com/mouse_guard_rpg.php" rel="nofollow">Mouseguard RPG</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPicture of the custom <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://img124.yfrog.com/i/y2jk.jpg/" rel="nofollow">Burning Empires Dice</a> I had made for the group.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250338/#Comment_250338" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T12:30:32+00:00" title="January 11, 2010 12:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2010 12:57PM by deadlytoque.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've enjoyed both episodes so far. I really like the democratic way you discuss the games, and the bouncing back-and-forth of ideas is great. You all seem to be working out issues that crop up in play, and to do so in a public forum is a great idea. I'd love to have "debrief" sessions like this with my own group, even just in private! I suspect not only will your understanding of the relationships between elements of games and actual play improve, but so will your respective personal appreciations of game design choices and how they were _intended_ to influence play.<br><br>I have just a few (hopefully constructive) bits of criticism:<br>1) You all need to work on your "radio voices" .You're speaking slowly and clearly enough, I think, but every once in a while it sounds like you are all wearing retainers. I don't know if perhaps you _are_ wearing retainers, or if it's a microphone issue, but there's a slurping noise on some of the sibilants. .<br>2) You discuss the AP well enough, but I keep waiting for one of you to make the critical/analytical step back from play to the rules. I thought the debate over the virtues of lifepaths and character burning would've been a great way to segue into the merits of lifepaths in general, as opposed to other forms of character creation.<br><br>Other than that, I'm really digging it; I've added your show to my RSS feed, and I'm looking forward to the next one!<br><br>Edited because I noticed you'd addressed one of my comments in the post above.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250342/#Comment_250342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T13:07:40+00:00" title="January 11, 2010  1:07PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback Adam.

You're absolutely right about recording yourself. My roommate and I are giving some thought to starting a podcast, and I KNOW we're going to have problems. I talk way too fast, as a rule, and he's a stage actor, so he TENDS TO PROJECT TO THE BACK OF THE ROOM, even when the microphone is 10 cm away.<br/><br/>I think your choice of having a moderator was a good one, since it definitely keeps you focused and on-topic, unlike many other podcasts where everyone tries to speak at once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250413/#Comment_250413" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T22:18:34+00:00" title="January 11, 2010 10:18PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Listening to yourself in recorded format is probably one of the most unkind things you can do to yourself.</blockquote>\nAnd one of the kindest things you can do for the benefit of others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
