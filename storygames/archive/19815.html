It reads rather incompletely to me at the moment. I liked the bit about moving the token back to the Past to flesh out a character in the Present, though it's not really clear when you come back to the Present (and move the token back). And I liked the notion of the Future, but it wasn't clear to me how one goes into the Future. So it's rather nebulous.<br/><br/>It'd be cool, for instance, if you could only prompt the future by asking another player to comment on the consequences of actions.<br/><br/>I like the general feel of this, though. I'm interested to see where it goes. The zipping-around between Past and Present and Future reminds me of a more personal-scope version of Microscope, only simplified and made easy-to-use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439552/#Comment_439552" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T17:05:47+00:00" title="October 17, 2014  5:05PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just submitted a game for Golden Cobra a few minutes ago myself; the first game I've designed since I was twelve. When I read your first couple paragraphs, I was briefly afraid that I'd written the same game as you, but they don't actually have much in common other than a lack of role-playing, and a sense of curiosity. <br/><br/>I really liked that kishotenketsu thread, and had been thinking about it a lot, though it doesn't factor into my design. I'm glad to see games that are aiming for it. I really like what you are trying here.  I kind of want to see a brief example of play, tho, just to get an idea of the procedures and flow of the game. As CarpeGuitarrem says it is a little unclear about when and how to interact with the timeline.<br/><br/>Also: a little more guidance on what constitutes a routine, and what constitutes breaking it. I think I know what you mean, mostly because I have also read Impro, but some examples could go a long way. Were I writing the game, I would also probably explicitly say to "be boring" in the section about finding out.<br/><br/>I like the body language mechanic, leaning back when you are done contributing. <br/><br/>I like the emphasis on texture, senses, and mundanity. I like that the default length of the game is pretty short. I could see pretty gentle and enjoyable play resulting from this. I would like to try the game, for sure, if I was with other people who would want to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439555/#Comment_439555" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T18:08:46+00:00" title="October 17, 2014  6:08PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2014 4:04PM by Rickard.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks all for the response.

I know myself sometimes wanted to frame a scene by I didn't know how to start it. I could probably have a paragraph that says something about that - to drop ideas for new explorations of a timeline.\n<blockquote>Also: a little more guidance on what constitutes a routine, and what constitutes breaking it.

Damn, it's hard to think in that way even if I know it myself. I will go back and reread what Viola Spolin and Keith Johnstone said.<br/><br/>I will make it clearer what constitutes a routine by repeating my definition.<br/><br/>There is a lot of repetition that's going on in the text. It's a new way of writing for me, so this game is a good place for experimentation for me.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This game is the peak of the vision of what I've been talking about since I came here. About how to design without using tangible rewards, about how most Forge games are following the same pattern where they ferociously seek conflicts in every scene, about how roleplaying games has too much text, about how we could form structures/rules of interaction that teaches people how to talk to each other, that you can immerse in more than the character, and what I started to question about how "roleplaying games" are not a genre in itself but a subgenre. This is very noticeable when some people have to describe their games as of what they don't include: dice, game master, acting in character, etc. Roleplaying games are just a minor area in a large subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439559/#Comment_439559" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-18T09:33:34+00:00" title="October 18, 2014  9:33AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"roleplaying games" are not a genre in itself but a subgenre.

I added one page and, apart from the obvious visual additions, here is what I changed:<br/><br/>PAGE 1<br/>Added the headline Knowing Yourself. I hope this will create a ground for a group feeling, so people know each other's expectations. I think I did a really cool thing here, where I created a "game mechanic" to force the participants to read about the game.<br/><br/>PAGE 2<br/>Broke out a part from Break the Routines into a headline of its own: To Be Obvious.<br/><br/>Added "future" to "people" in the Using an Overall Routine headline, as how to form a third situation.<br/><br/>PAGE 3<br/>Added time frames for each timeline. I think this will hugely improve the understanding of how the game is played.<br/><br/>Expanded The Future to hopefully make it more clear of how to use the timeline.<br/><br/>I think putting Be Aware of Each Other on the same page made it more clear of when to change timeline.<br/><br/>Added the headline Give Each Other Ideas, which explains when a situation is over.<br/><br/>PAGE 4<br/>By Making a Mistake now repeats what a routine is.<br/><br/>Added the headline You Evolve the Game, where you discuss the game afterwards.<br/><br/>Changed the name of the last headline.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I really hope this made it clear of how to play this game. Are there still questions about how to play it?<br/><br/>I would appreciate if anyone took the time to proof read my text. I spell checked it, but it will still contain weird sentences or misuse of expressions. I got a Gdrive document here.

Which is probably not true.<br/><br/>If the geography of the chart literally indicates the possible moves - which I think is awesome and brilliant - you have to be really anal about the overlaps of those ovals.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439676/#Comment_439676" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-25T01:30:09+00:00" title="October 25, 2014  1:30AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2014 1:32AM by Rickard.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>: You're totally right.
