It was a wonderfully intense and rewarding experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game was set in a Carolina rice plantation. The master, Haywood, was a powerfully cruel, evil man who, fortunately, was gone most of the time and left the plantation in the hands of his wife and overseer Boggs. I played Nero, a wheelwright. My goals were to keep my teenage son from being sold to another plantation and to get my teenage daughter, Temperance, out of the kitchen and away from the eye of master Haywood. Jason played Cesar, Nero's brother in law, who was a field hand. Jim  played Lemon, who worked in the kitchen and was trying to protect Temperance from master Haywood. Eric played the old root doctor, old enough to come over from Africa as a child. All of us had \u201cGet rid of master Haywood for good\u201d as our goal for the session. We were successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were two real highlights of the session, both revolving around the fate of poor Temperance. The first was when Lemon, having baked one of her famous lemon tarts, tries to gently suggest that things would be better for everybody if master Haywood's stay at the plantation was a short one. In the middle of this, Temperance deliberately drops the tart- my character has convinced her to purposefully get herself fired from her comparatively easy cooking duty so she can become a field hand far away from master Haywood- and Lemon let's it slip to Mrs. Haywood that she fears for Temperance's virtue with Mr. Haywood around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis becomes a conflict, which means Lemon rolls her worth (your only mechanical stat in the game, usually around 8-15 dice) plus any luck she wishes to spend (you get luck for rolling 2d6 at the beginning of every scene and getting a combination equaling seven) and the master rolls their power stat (I think) which is much, much higher than the players starting worth (around 20 dice). Combinations of dice equaling seven are successes, dice coming up one are failures, and you reroll dice which don't match anything once. If ether side doesn't like the outcome, you can choose to roll the skull die, which could give you an automatic success or a re roll but could also lead to your characters automatic, no appeal, death.<br/>\n<br/>\nLemon lost the conflict, rolled the skull die, and rolled the skull. Master Haywood overheard the conversation, then beat Lemon to death right in the middle of the kitchen, like a dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich in turn, made Temperance head cook.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, my character, Temperance (who became Jim's character after Lemon died), and the root doctor all plotted to poison master Haywood's breakfast. In the middle of our secret meeting, master Haywood breaks in, drunk as a lord, looking to take Temperance back to the plantation house to subject her to his advances. I try to convince him that she is sick, and no use to him in her state. This becomes another conflict, which I loose, I roll the skull die, I re-roll, I beat master Haywood, he rolls the skull die, and rolls the skull.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this moment, everybody at the table, except the game master, stands up and cheers. The tension built up after that long chain of dice rolls is palpable, almost unbearable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster Haywood succeeds in getting temperance back to the house, brings her to the basement, where she poisons his wine and he dies mid grope. She escapes unseen and his death is ruled a heart attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[align=center]<b>Observations<br/>\nor,<br/>\nA series of concerns I once had about Steal Away Jordan prove to be groundless; game is unmitigated awesome</b> [/align]<br/>\n<br/>\n1)At the beginning of the game, one of the other players mentioned that he was worried about engaging in minstrelsy, or being perceived by other people at the table as engaging in minstrelsy. I worried about the same thing. Those worries were, happily, unfounded. Because we were all so obviously being true to the characters as people, things that could be superficially perceived as minstrelsy, such as saying \u201cI'm as happy as a cat in a fish storm\u201d in a southern accent ( I really did that), are clearly not seen so by others at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)It's interesting that as players, we all initially said that we would shy away from really high tension topics, such as sexual abuse of slaves, and then, when play began, we immediately headed right toward the exact topic we initially said we wanted to avoid.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)One of the things we all agreed at the beginning of the game was no use of the N word. I was concerned that the removal of the N word would leave the game somewhat toothless. As it turns out, the word \u201cboy\u201d does all the work that the N word does in the dehumanization department without any of the associated problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)One of my concerns coming into the game was that it would quickly devolve into a cycle of players try to do something- game master humiliates and punishes players-repeat. The game doesn't do this at all, and it's all thanks to the games brilliant dice mechanics. The conflict mechanic, although it seems superficially to give an unbelievable advantage to the master, is in fact more weighted towards the center of the bell curve the more dice you have. Players with fewer dice in their pools have a smaller range of success, but a greater chance of extreme outcomes, both successes and failures. In fact, I suspect that the dice mechanic for conflicts, no matter how many dice you have, is less like a traditional roll against another persons dice pool, and more like a highly obscure and tense game of rock-paper-scissors. With an option, if you don't like your outcome, to escalate to a game of Russian roulette.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn conclusion, the game was really awesome, one of my best experiences all con. Much thanks to Jason, Jim, Eric, and especially Hans for running this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdited to fix Jim and Eric's names                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216065/#Comment_216065" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T14:30:55+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  2:30PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd been itching to play for ages and it was definitely a fun session.  All four of us were definitely engaged and playing hard (I think you got Jim and Eric backwards).  All the social/cultural baggage that I'm afraid keeps people from trying this game is just that, baggage.  At the table none of it was an issue.  We started with a good discussion and the rest took care of itself.<br><br>It's funny, when you talk about lines and veils, many times you are really talking about things that you want to see in play.  Perhaps the discussion flags it as an area requiring sensitivity, or a little ownership on the part of the person with the squick, but if it is called out, it usually shows up.<br><br>We chose to have the same goal - "Remove Master Haywood from the plantation forever" - and each set our own steps in achieving this.  I think for a convention game this is a really good move.  Not sure if Hans was surprised but it sure made things go very smoothly.<br><br> In play I found the die mechanic completely opaque, and assume that was a considered choice.  I never really understood where things would resolve, and that added a sense of uncertainty and determinism.  The skull die only amps this up.  I think we over-used the skull die a little, re-rolling a lot until something dramatic happened.  In both cases where it got used a bunch, it resulted in a death.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216078/#Comment_216078" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T15:15:12+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  3:15PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very informative, especially your observations on the concerns you had.

In addition, it was obvious that everybody was trying to play people, not caricatures. That being said,  When people did voices, they were distictly southern, and edged towards Morgan Freeman-esque bass, but pointed towards, rather than imitated, stereotypical African American accents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216091/#Comment_216091" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T16:05:47+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  4:05PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2009 4:06PM by Hans_c-o.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kingston, cool! Thanks for writing the AP. I was thinking about writing one, but we're all good now.<br><br>Jason- I was surprised. I figured you'd all have some big goal together, but I was so focused on playing NPCs and calling for conflicts (which you were really helpful with) that I wasn't thinking about your goals too much. I certainly wasn't trying to puzzle 'em out and throw  you curveballs. I think the game works well in that regard. The GM plays the NPCs with all their motivations etc., and the PCs angle for what they want in this sticky web of dangerous relationships.<br><br>Regarding the dice: Yeah, I'm not so sure about them, either. I mean, I don't think it impeded our fun or anything, but it's hard to know, at the table, what you're going for. I've heard (need to go do some research) that more dice = more opportunities for failure, which is a kind of cool, subtle indictment of the worth of slaveholders, but I don't know how well that works in play, since all the mechanics are pointed toward the players angling for more lucky dice.<br><br>Also: When pushing your luck, you can only roll the Skull die once. That was something we did wrong in the game, and it was my fault for not understanding that completely. <br><br>Anyway, I did have a great time playing. I'd love to play/run it for three sessions or so and see how that goes. The game went lickety-split quick, since the players only had two goals and one of them was shared all around. A full three-goals game would probably be more nuanced, I think.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216200/#Comment_216200" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T08:44:35+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  8:44AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a fascinating actual play report, I must admit, before reading this I had no interest in this game but if it comes up at a con I may now give it a try.<br><br>Thanks.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216281/#Comment_216281" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T16:04:57+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  4:04PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>When pushing your luck, you can only roll the Skull die once.</blockquote>\nOh man, that would have really changed our game a lot.  ironically not for the better, given convention  time constraints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
