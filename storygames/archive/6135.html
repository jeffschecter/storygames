Hooray for Indie games that need to organisation!<br/><br/>I get three players, Debbie, Adam and Graham. It's the morning slot so people are a bit zonked and I have the tail end of a sore throat. Not ideal situations.<br/><br/>So we start pitching ideas back and forth. Zooming in from a general feel "dark comedy" via a couple of diversions into pseudo reality-tv, and end up with the following:<br/><br/>It's a show about a German exchange student who comes to England and stays with a family of cultists. It's a dark comedy drama.<br/><br/>This takes us about fifteen minutes, followed by a further half hour fleshing out our characters: Gunter, our naive exchange student who just wants to be accepted. Terror (or Trevor) Black, the family's son, who just wants to be normal. Christiana Black, the matriarch and leader of the cult, owner of a foul temper. Plus attendant family members, little sister, Vengeance with her knives and the downtrodden Brummie father. Plus hangers on in the way of the school exchange counsellor with her "wheel of feeling" and a social worker nemesis.<br/><br/>It worked so well. It was all in the wonderful contrasts between the everyday and the weird, I just love this kind of juxtaposition stuff. Lots of moments of ha, ha, ha! Ouch...<br/><br/>A selection of scenes: <br/><br/>Gunter in discussion with the counsellor. "I have problems with some words, but it's all okay, Ja? They are going to have a December-ment?" Counsellor: "Well, yes, it is coming up for Christmas."<br/><br/>Terror and Gunter playing guitar hero, with Terror slowly turning up the volume to drown out something horrific going on in the basement. Only to have Christiana come up and bawl the kids out because of the noise.<br/><br/>The office of Sinsiter Uncle Aphonse, a lawyer, forcing the family to "owe him Gunter" in exchange for making some trouble with the police and social services go away.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136691/#Comment_136691" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T13:21:02+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  1:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I actually saw this on Channel Four in 1989, although I have never been to England and never actually watched Channel Four, and at any rate my parents wouldn't have let me watch it in 1989.

How completely wrong I was.  We managed to do series creation and two episodes in three hours - which is pretty amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI very much enjoyed the game, but never really clicked with Terror.  I'm not sure if that was because of his low screen presence or if he just a slightly dull character.   It's a pity that we didn't manage to find time to play his spotlight episode too - that would have been interesting.  If we were doing the set-up again, I would have be tempted to take the little sister Vengeance as my protagonist.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yeah, great game, thanks for running it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, you people lied to me: Scunthorpe isn't even coastal - how could our location research team have been so wrong?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAdam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136767/#Comment_136767" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-28T07:23:18+00:00" title="March 28, 2008  7:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cthulahoops</cite>Oh, you people lied to me: Scunthorpe isn't even coastal - how could our location research team have been so wrong?</blockquote>\nPah!

The pitch session only being 15 minutes probably helped.  They've always lasted about an hour for me.  Was there anything in particular you guys did to help speed up the pace?<br/><br/>What about the episodes themselves? With 15 minute pitch and 30 minute characters in a three hour period, that's just over an hour each episode.  That's making some really good time.  Did you intentionally limit scenes or play fast? Did you just burn through budget quick? Or perhaps simply said, "Okay, time's up, credits roll, Episode 2 is starting up!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136883/#Comment_136883" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T06:49:06+00:00" title="March 29, 2008  6:49AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Wow that is amazing!

I've also done enough of this kind of prep (it's similar to Covenant's in some ways) to spot the tells of "that's cool" or "that's shit" that people give off.<br/><br/>Each player got two scene requests per episode, and the scenes zoomed in on the conflicts pretty nicely. Again being a con game helped, as there's the expectation of pace. We reached the end of budget quite naturally at the right points, as it happened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
