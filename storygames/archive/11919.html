Ban has been awarding certificates of accomplishment to the kid for the kid learning and striving and accomplishing. Then there is a scene where Ben intentionally ruins this reward cycle by flinging certificates at the kid, saying something like "Here, have as many as you want. Does that make you feel good?"<br/><br/>I had a game-design take-away from that scene:<br/>1) Ben just ruined the game he had set up. The certificates had weight before, because they were gated by a seemingly-solid procedure. Earning a certificate was an accomplishment. But then Ben exploded the game by making it look like it was all a sham.<br/>2) "Real" accomplishment and illusionary  accomplishment are difficult to disentangle. All that kid needed was a solid-seeming procedure to gate the certificates, and earning them seemed like an accomplishment.<br/><br/>Memory 2:<br/>I'm in high-school, and a friend of mine is regaling me with the awesome adventures of some fantasy book hero. The guy does all this bad-ass stuff, and accomplishes mighty things. And I can't help but think the whole time, "So what? You do realize that the author can write anything he wants down, right? So it's really not impressive at all that the dude scaled the wall with his knives." Similarly, while I enjoyed the first book in Feist's Riftwar Saga, and first book of Dune, later books in both series left me totally cold. In the first books, I could believe that the author was "playing fair" with me, putting people into hard situations and then narrating what would come of it in a way I could buy into. Later books gave the heroes superpowers that let them get out of anything arbitrarily. So who cares anymore.<br/><br/>Now, to RPGs:<br/>I think I am particularly sensitive to this "weightiness"/"real accomplishment" issue. RPGs that allow us to tell cool stories without enough constraints/struggle/difficulty leave me cold. And yet RPGs that conduct themselves much like boardgames (D&amp;D 4e, played straight) also leave me cold, because I'd rather play a good boardgame.<br/><br/>Is anyone else like this? What is going on with my brain?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266122/#Comment_266122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T10:18:37+00:00" title="April  8, 2010 10:18AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a similar feeling with regards to leveling up.

And both those games have really satisfied. Let me add a possibly small detail to what you describe as "Legitimate Adversity." I also like to feel that there was a relatively fixed, relatively objective level of adversity I had to face. So not only is it important that the opposition might succeed, but also that it doesn't have a "rubber band" response to my performance. A GM who obviously fudges an encounter strength because we had bad luck on an early encounter. A computer game that openly scales the difficulty based on my performance. Steals away some of my satisfaction.

Over the years I've come to realize that things like Drama Dice in 7th Sea and other kinds of "Fudge Results" mechanics act as a hidden "Rubber Band."<br/><br/>The opposition remains fixed through out play.  However, at the beginning the game the players have few resources, so he seems powerful and tough.  But as the game goes on the players accumulate more "Fudge Results" bennies so that even though the opposition remains fixed through out the players are given the illusion of finally beating the opposition in the end.<br/><br/>It's a clever way to encode a "story arc" into the mechanics.  The characters get kicked around at the beginning but ultimately triumph in the end.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266141/#Comment_266141" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T12:34:17+00:00" title="April  8, 2010 12:34PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yes and no. Millions upon millions thrill to read thrillers in which there is never any real doubt about the outcome. Justice prevails in paperback thrillers, although it may be punched in the face several times before the ending. I think the phrase "suspension of disbelief" is a bit over/mis-used, so hey, let me steal the concept here and over/mis-use it further.  To enjoy these sorts of properties (thrillers, mysteries, comic books, episodic television, medical television, legal thriller television, action movies, horror movies, romances...), you have to be able to pretend that the ending (or the outcome of other tensions) is in doubt. A skillful author/creator will aid the reader/consumer by having characters who are in doubt about the ending, adversaries who push hard against the ending, and narration that makes it seem like several different endings could happen.  But if someone interrupts you when you are on the first page of (say) the latest Lenny Bliss mystery by Bob Sloan (a series of mysteries you really should be reading, they're very good) and says "how does it come out, does Bliss catch the guy?", you're really not going to be giving anything away to yourself or them if you say "Yep."<br/><br/>Jesse calls it a safety net, but that's not really right.  That implies that a creator who doesn't use the safety net might reach the same sort of ending but it would be "better" because, in their heads, they thought it might come out another way. I don't think that's true, because the experience of the story for the reader/audience/consumer is indistinguishable.  Of course in gaming all the roles are intertwingled - it might feel better to <i>be</i> a creator who doesn't accept a particular limitation, but that's just one person's feeling. We know limitations aid creativity, speaking generally, so it shouldn't be a big surprise or counterintuitive that a (for example) "catch the bad guy" limitation on mystery stories might help many mystery story creators and make the process of creation more fun for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266144/#Comment_266144" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T12:46:07+00:00" title="April  8, 2010 12:46PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's important to consider where the drama in the game is supposed to come from.

Gurps 700 point mages, to be exact. Using one of my 157 spells, well, who can stand against me?<br/>\nOur GM's well aware of this, though, and therefore often gives us challenges where magic isn't the solution to the problem. We often, in our travels get confronted with more mundane problems such as being accused of witchcraft in a medieval setting where revealing the existence of magic is a HUGE no-no (as in eliminate all witnesses if it happens).<br/>\nLast session our party was accused of being complicit in the disappearance of two girls.<br/>\nWe were the last to be seen with them and they were indeed dead (one by accidental fall, one by a rather psychotic mage who wanted to be SURE that she wouldn't report us).<br/>\nWe were all hauled in for interrogation, with the others being reeased one by one as the day progressed. Excepting, of course, my own character, who was just about the only one not at all involved in death or disappearance. She suddenly found herself chained and without magic, being tortured by knights templars until she confessed her sins so they could burn her and save her soul.<br/>\nWhy her? Well, she was moderately pretty and had no alibi, and obviously witchcraft had been used since the girls were gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, even powerful characters can't just rely on being powerful.

My aesthetic makes it hard for me to enjoy many of the properties you mention. If the genre requires that the hero win, that's a major minus in my book.<br/><br/>Your point about the safety net is good. The viewer doesn't know if the creator used a safety net. But, actually, I do know sometimes. Certain genres require a safety net. When I went to see Juno, or An Education, or Hurt Locker, I had no clue what was going to happen to the protagonist. I did not feel the writer steering us, and the limitations of the genre didn't require her to.<br/><br/>Episodic television is very hard for me. Unless the core appeal is either "Dance for me, funny jesters!" (Big Bang Theory, The Office) or "Show me a smart guy being awesome" (House). And that's it for TV for me.<br/><br/>When Vincent Baker showed me that you can have uncertain outcomes, and yet still know that the PCs will succeed (but at what cost!), that was genius. Because it certainly helps resolve the problem. Now, I'm not quite as aesthetically satisfied with that solution as Vincent is, but it's an acceptable way out of the dilemma.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266154/#Comment_266154" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T13:43:55+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  1:43PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doubt is a very good word and I more or less require it to fully enjoy a game.

The aesthetic problems I have with "powerful characters need to use their heads" is twofold.<br/>1) Kryptonite. The protagonist is super-powerful, so you need some rule-breaker that counters him. I find that aesthetically displeasing. Many solutions to what to do about powerful protagonists feel like Kryptonite.<br/>2) Even worse is the fact that it is going to be hard to sell me on the verisimilitude of a world with these people in it. Even the powers of 5th-level characters in 1e D&amp;D was bothersome to me. Having Clerics who could continually cast Create Food and Water or Magic-Users with Continual Light spells should have a social and economic effect on the world. Seriously, this bugged me at the time. It still does. It's going to take a lot to make a consistent world with powerful characters. And if someone needs to pull a "Lost/X-Files" maneuver on me, I'm going to be totally disinterested from then on.<br/><br/>Let me re-iterate that this is my aesthetic, and make no pretense that it is objectively correct.

In play there are some questions which are assumed even when asked, and some which are very much unknown. <br/><br/>I suspect that the degree of risk and uncertainty desired depends on how generally risk averse/favoring the players are both generally and in that situation. But of course part of the trick for meeting multiple desires in that regard is to keep what one player wants to know about fairly constrained (will we survive) while keeping what another player cares about more risky and uncertain (who gets the boy). There exist many techniques for doing this, as a player, GM, or a game designer. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266160/#Comment_266160" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T13:53:16+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  1:53PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>When I read Dennis Lehane's Patrick Kenzie, I'm reasonable sure that (a) Kenzie will survive and (b) he will solve the crime.

I mean, the whole concept even of a very formulaic mystery is that along the way there will be plenty of surprises and unknown situations.  And there are many thrillers where the bad guy escapes, but the good guy still prevails.  It doesn't really get you outside the genre, though.  That's part of it.<br/><br/><i>Michael Clayton</i> is a great movie. Really underrated. I don't even think it's a thriller, really. I've watched it three times and gotten more out of the characters each time.  There's no question you can steal from more stereotypical sources in order to give your non-formulaic creation a quick shortcut to audience investment.  <i>Michael Clayton</i> steals from thrillers, quite a bit, to boost tension and uncertainty to a huge level, as you experienced.  But so much of that movie happens when Tilda Swinton's character is alone in a room or when Michael stops the car to talk to his son.  There is nothing in those scenes that is even slightly relevant to the thriller aspect of the movie. I see those scenes as the center of the movie, though.  Pretty cool.<br/><br/>Actually it's a particularly great example for gamers because the film is very conscious about its thefts from thrillers, yet it makes something new. Similarly for us, we steal from other sorts of things all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266168/#Comment_266168" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T14:03:07+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  2:03PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Are you familiar with Meg Baker's distinction between No One Gets Hurt vs. I Will Not Abandon You?

I think it's EXTREMELY relevant to this conversation and to your point in particular.<br/><br/>One of the things I've come to learn about myself is that, as a GM, I totally despise being responsible for the emotional safety of the players.  Playing that social role breaks my personal sense of "immersion."  Normally, I avoid that word but here I'm using it in a very personal sense that applies to me and me only, not as global definition.  The sensation that *I* call immersion only happens for me when I'm allowed to unleash my creativity on pure gut impulse and trust that the players will engage that with their own honest passion, no matter where that passion leads us.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266169/#Comment_266169" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T14:03:48+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  2:03PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben and Mendel: You are definitely onto something, and I agree with the usefulness of the technique.

For example, Oblivion was RUINED for me once the game stuck it in my face that it was ramping creatures in response to my leveling.</blockquote>\nInitially I had this reaction too, then I looked up Oblivion level optimisation, it's bizarre and backwards but puts the fun back in the game. The opposition scales according to your level, but your level doesn't necessarily determine your power - there can be a pretty wide difference between capability in various things at different levels, so it gets interesting (although in a different way). Final Fantasy 8 is the same, you actually get more powerful by not leveling up, and the advantage there is you can switch from grinding to finishing the story whenever you feel like it, rather than having to grind a certain amount to get powerful enough to finish the story (I quit playing Final Fantasy X-2 because halfway through chapter 3 I stopped wanting to grind and do 100% completion and by chapter 5 I was getting killed by everything). There's the satisfaction at least in having beaten the system, and because it's a single player game there's no guilt in the power gaming. <br/><br/>Where leveling up really feels like something is if you're in sandbox play and can face something of any level. Munchkin's like this - you can just start out and face a level 17 monster which will insta-kill you if you don't run. Having to run from something at first, and finally being able to face it later and beat it does feel satisfying. Also, if losing doesn't mean death, being beaten once, powering up and then coming back and winning also feels good, but for a system with escalating power to really feel rewarding you have to sometimes face and escape opposition that's far too powerful for you, and occasionally opposition that's so easy as to almost be not worth your time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>So not only is it important that the opposition might succeed, but also that it doesn't have a "rubber band" response to my performance. A GM who obviously fudges an encounter strength because we had bad luck on an early encounter. A computer game that openly scales the difficulty based on my performance. Steals away some of my satisfaction. (Am I dating myself badly when I say the worst instance of this was NBA Jam?)</blockquote>\nThis is where I like Dragon Age. 100XP if your encounter was easy, 200XP if it was average, 300XP if it was hard. Nothing gets fudged, but the outcome determines the reward. You don't feel cheated, it's not like you have an incredibly difficult fight due to bad rolls and get 15XP, or you have the difficulty always scaled to fit you, once the encounter is set, that's what you're facing and nothing gets fudged, but if your luck was bad, your reward is bigger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266259/#Comment_266259" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T01:42:20+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  1:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you're hitting some existential angst.

Some of them work when there are "real" challenges, some work when there are "fake" challenges, some work whether or not there's even a challenge at all.  I like having that flexibility -- if all of my fun was tied up in just one thing, I don't think I would have stuck with gaming as a hobby<br/><br/><br/>Level-scaling really does irk me, though.  If every single task is always difficult no matter how good my character is at something, I get annoyed.  Sometimes I'll put everything I possibly can behind a concept -- WWI Flying Ace, say -- and then discover that even with his ridiculously fast reflexes and insane aerobatic skills and eagle eye, all that it means is the target number on every roll gets bumped up so that I still have the same 66% chance of failure all the time.  Because it's "<i>more challenging</i> that way."<br/><br/>That's usually the point where I stop and try to explain that, no, see, the whole point of playing someone who's really ridiculously good at something is so that doing those things will be <i>easy</i>.

And of course it all comes down to the emerging, evolving social assumptions of play. No One Gets Hurt and I Will Not Abandon You can help identify some of those structures before hand, but as usual the problem with talking about assumptions is that there is no method to ensure that you've voiced them all. <br/><br/><br/>Mark, <br/><br/>It seems to me that you desire the experience of an ecology of risk, where the character difficulties of the game exist not only in relation to your character but to each other. Blatantly trashing that ecology by raising it uniformly, or by introducing something that shocks it massively seems to be a source of massive problems - and no wonder that would screw with the very real sense of accomplishment that you've taken in understanding and adapting to that ecology. <br/><br/>Now what I'm arguing is entirely different, I'm saying that you need your ecology of hazards in a strata of character activity, say direct obstacles to running your businesses of questionable legality, but not in every other concievable risk area. So you might get shot or be getting married, and those will interact with your business problems, but you don't need to have an entire ecology of romantic problems to deal with or an entire ecology of back room surgery complications. <br/><br/>And there are other elements that we can eliminate the risk of because we just aren't that interested in them. Sure some of the characters don't eat too well, but does that mean this game needs to track their medical status, and face the possibility that one or more of them will die of a heart attack or maybe a prolonged bout with cancer. And of course all that changes if one of the players wants to have her character have one of these - but do you really feel cheated that there isn't an ecology of difficulties here, that we don't properly reflect that some heart attacks and cancers are more lethal or more insidious than others, or is are you good with that player to dialing the disease she wants? <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266290/#Comment_266290" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T07:36:07+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  7:36AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Level scaling isn't about challenge or difficulty, it's about pacing and rollout of new content.

Inevitable leveling (e.g. WoW) annoys me and draws attention to itself in the way Steve described. Game position improvement that is undermined via scaling opposition (ala the WWI flying ace) strikes me as robbery of my legitimate gain. Game position improvement that is earned only by tooling the system (ala Oblivion) strikes me as a non-real accomplishment within the frame of the game world. It therefore robs the game world of weight. I have become a more powerful in silly-land, where a warrior who has taken Conjuration as a focus skill is rewarded with weaker opposition. I don't care about that world. Far better by my aesthetic is to have relatively fixed opposition that I can see myself approaching in terms of relative game position through good play and game-world-logical consequences of my actions. The evil 12th level baron is too strong for me to depose right now. But just you wait. That's super-cool.<br/><br/>Everyone: It has definitely helped to think through this topic with all of you.

So now I'm doing 47 damage to a monster with 235 HP instead of 1 damage to a monster with 5 HP. Big deal.

You've reduced any sense of accomplishment and <i>legitimate challenge</i> down to a simulated sensation. <br/><br/>There must be an aspect of causal reality (or in-fiction verisimilitude) for accomplishment to be legitimate.<br/><br/>For example: If I was to return to the starting town at level 20 and fought the dire-rats that challenged me at level 1 and found them still a challenge, I would know my accomplishment was redundant. If, however, I could kill them with ease, then I know my 'level' has meaning - I have legitimately progressed. Similarly, if I rushed ahead to the dragons lair at level 1 and managed to kill it, my understanding of in-game challenges would be destroyed. <br/>Simply because game-masters are proficient at <i>balancing</i> challenges to match character levels doesn't mean we should become complacent about our interactions with the game-world. This is why I advocate throwing over-powered and under-powered monsters (correspondent to the character-level) at players; it enforces the 'reality' of the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266317/#Comment_266317" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T10:21:15+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 10:21AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I was unclear - I was assuming that as you leveled Cave Rats would get demoted from 'hard' to 'easy' to 'don't' bother rolling'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266462/#Comment_266462" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-10T04:52:59+00:00" title="April 10, 2010  4:52AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two Worlds, for it's flaws, seems to have done away with <i>invisible </i>"rubber banding", in that a 3 HD wolf is always a 3 HD wolf, but once your character is powerful enough, they can get through a gate to an area that has 6 HD dire wolves.

This is compounded with new opposition being paced throughout the game, as you play more, you have to learn to play better to continue playing. I would like a tabletop game that had pacing similar to God Hand where the act of playing was paced to make me better at playing the game, so even if I make the numbers go up on my character sheet, I know also that I am playing better.<br/><br/>When playing RPGs I don't go out of my way to grind. If I can't beat a certain challenge because I'm too low a level I will stop playing. I also don't want rubberbanding because that's boring. I can beat the main quest of Oblivion at level 1 in about 2 hours if I skip through dialogue as fast as possible (and good lord I want to skip that shitty writing). That's not fun. Final Fantasy 8 is kind of fun because the systems in place are completely broken so that I can become much stronger if I stay at level 1 and junction skills than if I actually try to play the game like a normal person. Morrowind is also fun for this (I am sure some people have seen that "win morrowind in 7 minutes" video).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266763/#Comment_266763" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:31:25+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:31PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That would create a problem with multiple players.

Different tactical choices. A less fun game IMO, but hey. And unless the GM is fudging losing is totally possible. It's often a meaningless death (bad guy got a full round of attacks and crits), which means the story we tell with 3rd ed is like one of those Vietnam war TV shows where supporting characters get randomly killed - one of the themes may be the capriciousness of life.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird is guilty of rubber-banding - and when I ran it I didn't bring any "yes, but..." to the table, it was a big pile of win for the protagonists - is it one of the games that leaves Mark the OP cold? For my group it was awesome. How can this be?<br/>Were my players simply philistines, enjoyers of the "you win" button, not the sort to enjoy the more subtle pleasures of brutal protagonist death and tragedy?<br/>Were they convinced - did they have the illusion they could have failed - like the kid in Bobby Fischer?  (Some of them, maybe, but surely not all of them.)<br/>Is hitting keys the real game there? The lady and Kate arguing about whether they should loot the hand of sorrow's storerooms, Cyrus abandoning his desire for the lady, Snargle "risking" his own life to save a hand of sorrow crewmember...<br/><br/>I remember playing a game of The Pool with Mark the OP where I could have sworn he was quite disappointed with a series of whiffed rolls, and that game floundered and died ... just sayin' ... (I don't think Mark reads this board anymore so I can talk shit about him and he'll never know!) ... sure, we want the possibility of failure, but that doesn't mean we want to fail ... maybe an illusion where we're convinced that we could fail but don't is what we really want ...<br/><br/>What about the other way - what about games where you practically can't "win"? Going into Fiasco or Polaris knowing I'm going to "lose" is a little dissatisfying for me in a similar way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317101/#Comment_317101" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T15:55:40+00:00" title="March 18, 2011  3:55PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>(I don't think Mark reads this board anymore so I can talk shit about him and he'll never know!)</blockquote>\nAh, but if one posts on a thread that Mark has bookmarked....<br/><br/>Re: Lady Blackbird. As you know, I have a lot of respect for the design of that game. But, yes, playing it rather fails for my aesthetic. I ran it for my group, and they enjoyed it. But I felt just like Ben Kingsley. They were enjoying the facade that I had created. They liked seeing how they were going to win.<br/><br/>Is it so surprising that lots of people like games where you are really just hitting the "I win" button? (I don't agree with the Philistines label, btw.) World of Warcraft is an elaborate "I win" button. All of those super-popular facebook games are "I win" button games. Call of Duty (single-player). Madden (people overwhelmingly play on the difficulty setting that lets them win games handily.) People like to win, and all they really want is for a gifted Ben Kingsley to give them some psychological cover.<br/><br/>Re: The Pool. I don't recall this game session.<br/><br/>Re: Fiasco. I like this game as a collaborative creative storytelling exercise. The game consistently and credibly tells me not to worry about "winning" or "losing." Tell a story about these people. Accept the parameters and constraints as interesting creativity frames. And just all of you tell a story together. It takes the winning/competition part of the game off the table.<br/><br/>Contrast with Lady Blackbird, many of whose mechanics seem to be saying that this game IS about winning, and improving characters. And so that winning/competition part is right there on the table. And the way it plays out doesn't really work for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317108/#Comment_317108" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T17:27:04+00:00" title="March 18, 2011  5:27PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>(I don't think Mark reads this board anymore so I can talk shit about him and he'll never know!)</blockquote>\nAh, but if one posts on a thread that Mark has bookmarked....<br/><br/>Ho, busted.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>Re: The Pool.
