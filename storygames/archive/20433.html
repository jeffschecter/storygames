So, I've never actually sat down and ran a game of Apocalypse World, but I've decided to change that and have just been brushing up on the rules and whatnot. Now, I gather that a lot of what's presented in the MC section is, to some extent, a kind of guide to solid GM practices. I really like that. However, it does seem to be a very literal requirement to running Apocalypse World properly. Also, cool.  However, there's a specific section of the MC Principles &amp; one of the MC Moves that I'm having a little bit of trouble reconciling.<br/><br/><b>MC Principle:</b> <br/>Be a fan of the PCs - In the body of that text, there's a specific example of how it's not cool to take away a gunluggers guns or a specific momento that makes them a unique and layered individual. cool, I can do that.<br/><br/><b>MC Move:</b><br/>Take away their stuff - I also get the general idea behind this GM move. Take away things that have consequence for them and that they're interested in getting back. Now, I can make the logical leap that it's totally fine to take a gunlugger's gun as part of a move, as long as I don't dump them into a volcano right? Like it's totally fair to steal her rpg, use it against the crew, but eventually, she's got the opportunity to get it back.  At least, I think that doesn't seem to violate the principle nor the move. <br/><br/>However, where I get a little wonky w/ this is how the game handles gangs. Sure, combat happens, and in combat, people take hits. Eventually, the gang takes enough hits that it's dropping from large to medium or even small. Logical, natural, sounds like the harsh wasteland to me.  Buuut, a gang is about as iconic to a hardholder/chopper as a gun is to a gunlugger no? The game is about scarcity, people are a scarcity as much as any of your other tangible resources.   <br/><br/>I guess what I'm looking for is: where's the line? I'm advised to be a fan and not take away what makes the player the player. That's awesome, I've always believed in that. Buuut, one of my moves is take their shit. And in a harried combat situation, enemies would want to take away guns and shoot down gangs. Replacing either of which is gonna be a real bastard in the blasted wastes. <br/><br/>I don't know. This question already sounds stupid, probably is. I'm just trying really hard to play this game as purely as written as possible so I can say I gave it a fair shake.  Any elucidation on this aspect of the game would be great. I can just say, yeah i'm not gonna be an asshole and run it w/ good faith. But, I'd love to hear from some veterans who have a better handle on what the game is actually trying to deliver.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449400/#Comment_449400" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-11T06:54:41+00:00" title="November 11, 2015  6:54AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2015 6:59AM by Paul_T.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're quite right to place "gangs" in along with "their stuff": although members of the gang should have names, simple, straightforward desires, and so forth, ultimately a *gang* is kind of a tool for the PC.<br/><br/>The MC Principles and Moves are often at a slight contradiction, as you point out: there's a lot of "hey, do this... but also don't do that!" in the rules as written. <br/><br/>It sounds to me like you've got the right idea in your understanding of these Principles: use moderation and common sense, and give some careful thought before doing something which makes a character less of who they are. I would fully trust you, as my MC, to make the right call, based on what you've written here.<br/><br/>Thinking as a fan of the PCs, this should come quite naturally. If you were writing a TV show you were excited about, you would never take away one of the main characters' most defining items, abilities, or relationships - it's fine to take away their "stuff", like food, water, weapons, and friends. But not the stuff which makes them who they are: maybe that's a souvenir or a loved or trademark weapon.<br/><br/>Batman isn't suddenly going to lose all his Bat-stuff in episode 3 and turn into a regular businessman. If he does, it's a temporary setback, nothing more.<br/><br/>However, there are times when breaking that rule could be really, really effective. It's just not something you do without some hard thought: it's going to be dramatic and shocking and you'd better be doing it for a good reason. (If you're a Game of Thrones fan, Jaime Lannister losing his sword-hand is a good example!)<br/><br/>Remember, especially, that taking something away irrevocably is a Hard Move, and a Hard Move should telegraphed in advance through softer moves: this will allow you to get a read on the player's reaction, as well. Hint plenty at the possibility, so the player knows it's coming, and you have a chance to see if they're enthusiastic about the possibility or scared and/or withdrawing from the game.<br/><br/>This is art, not science. (If you want a hard rule, don't ever take away something which defines a character. But the grey area can be ripe with possibilities, if you're brave enough, and worth exploring when it feels right.)<br/><br/>As for taking away things which are rightfully a PC's because the rules say so - a Gunlugger's fuck-off guns, a Chopper's gang, something gained and paid for by an advance, and so forth - you also have the right idea, I think. Certainly those things can be threatened, damaged, hurt, and potentially lost. But not without a little care and thought; it's a game-changing moment.<br/><br/>I would say that it's always OK (and good) to talk about it with the players. ("Hey, looks like your gang is getting pretty thin, and threatening to leave. How do you feel about that?") You might get different answers if you ask in-character vs. out-of-character, so try both if you're not sure.<br/><br/>However, if something is a PC's right <i>by the rules</i>, as you say, there's a little extra weight there, as well. I think it's perfectly fair to say that, within the bounds of reasonable fiction and plausible scenarios, the thing which has been lost should be replenished or replaced relatively soon. If the gang is getting depleted, the character shouldn't find it too hard to find new members. (But remember to put your bloody fingerprints on everything and don't be afraid to use those new members to cause some trouble!) Perhaps a bunch of weirdos even show up of their own volition - they're hungry and lost and can they join the gang, please?<br/><br/>Likewise for a special weapon or possession: perhaps the character has a good chance to find it again, or an interesting replacement is available to them.<br/><br/>Maintain the plausibility of the fiction, but be on the lookout for opportunities to do that.<br/><br/>If it seems totally implausible that the feature can be replaced (the gang is dead and the PCs are on a deserted island), and the player isn't jazzed about the loss (it doesn't make them more excited about the game, in other words) I'd say apologize to the player and offer them a free advance so they can replace it with something different. (Perhaps the moment will even inspire them to change Playbooks - the Chopper loses his gang and decides to become a pacifist, that kind of thing.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449402/#Comment_449402" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-11T08:35:28+00:00" title="November 11, 2015  8:35AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't speak to "purely as written", but I can say this:<br/><br/>When I'm a fan of characters in a game like this, that means I want them to go through some shit so I can see how they deal with it.

However, if you try and take away something that makes Character A themselves, then you're (probably) doing it wrong: it's not just "stuff" you're taking away, you're hurting the core character concept \u2014 not something a real fan would do.<br/><br/>In other words: what David said.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/miedvied" title="miedvied"><img alt="miedvied" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/miedvied">miedvied</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449406/#Comment_449406" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-11T13:44:15+00:00" title="November 11, 2015  1:44PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the contradiction is (1) Take Away Their Stuff is relatively broad; it includes domicile, food, water, clothes, relationships, etc., and probably wasn't written with core concept-related items in mind, and (2) some of this "stuff" isn't "stuff." <br/><br/>When it comes to taking away a Lugger's gun, for instance, I'd think of it like losing a hand: it's all fair play, but it should be a big deal, and rare, and not a lasting limitation. I'd no more consider that fair play than I would taking away the Green Lantern's ring, or Night Rider's car, or Duncan McLeod's katana. That is, it -is- fair, but it's the sort of thing that basically drives an episode all unto itself, ends with recovery, and should only ever be played very infrequently. Because it's core to the concept, it's not "taking away stuff," it's "changing my character," and the latter shouldn't happen without consent of the player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449407/#Comment_449407" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-11T13:48:50+00:00" title="November 11, 2015  1:48PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a relevant actual play example from a Dungeon World game.<br/>The MC was a veteran GM of traditional games at his first attempt with DW.<br/><br/>He made lots of mistakes, but that was to be expected.<br/>The relevant one here was this:<br/><br/>My bard was in a port city, at night, kind of "challenging" a very bad storm that we understood was of unnatural origin.<br/>Since the MC had described pretty cool visual effects (purple clouds, weird shaped lightnings, a strange sound hidden within the wind) I decided to face the elements, get out of the tavern, reach an elevated point, and use my bardic knowledge or spout lore to make sense of it, get more info.<br/><br/>It was obvious that the MC had not planned for any of this, that the storm was just a cool special effect with no substance, and that my interest in it was throwing a wrench in his pre-set quest expectations.<br/>But this is not the point, never mind this.<br/><br/>I describe.

I think I have a much better understanding of how to apply the principles and moves of the game. <br/><br/>By way of explanation, this all comes up because I know my players. The minute they realize they can have a gang, they will pretty much use them for every single thing they can think of. Because, ya know, PC's desires &gt; NPC's safety. Inevitably, that's going to mean putting the gang into ridiculous situations where they'll be forced down a path that they probably don't want. <br/><br/>Like Paul pointed out, I was most concerned about how to handle this when players have spent an improvement or picked up a gang at char creation. The very fact that they pick this option means they're telling me having this gang is an important facet to their character. But, as Vincent pointed out, by choosing to use their gang in a certain way, they're already making the choice to put their control of that asset under contention. It does no one any good if I utterly babysit that gang so as to protect their investment. I'm robbing them of an interesting moment and diluting the impact/fun of having a gang to command. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, it seems to come down to: use good judgement, validate their choices, think hard before you take their stuff, but certainly do so to make their lives a show we all want to watch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449416/#Comment_449416" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-11T20:54:28+00:00" title="November 11, 2015  8:54PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, exactly.
