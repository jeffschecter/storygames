We've tracked down Uriah to his hidden asteroid base.  Naomi is holding Captain Vance's broken, nearly dead body, and chooses to spend an advancement on Key of Secret Love, having been moved by his sacrifice of his own body to protect the Lady Blackbird from Uriah's silvery 10 foot tall commandos.  Meanwhile, Kale combines magics with the Lady in order to sneak LB into Uriah's Mechanical throne chamber.  LB immediately begins confessing her love for him, and this happens: (paraphrased)<br/><br/>Uriah: you fool!<br/>LB: what?<br/>Uriah: How did you get here?  I intentionally mislead you away from here, to protect you!<br/>LB: Protect...  protect me?  From what?<br/>Uriah: It's too late, the Chronometronon has already activated. The land you stand upon is no longer an asteroid, but a mountain top, in a another plane of existence.<br/>Kale: Ok, now I'm confused, what the fuck just happened?<br/>Uriah: We've slipped through the rift, and the Ley Lines will not align for another 17 years.  I fear you are now stuck in my home world.<br/>LB: and where is that?<br/>Uriah: Canada.  We're going to have to find you some Mega-Damage armor...<br/><br/><br/>WE'RE STOKED.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430638/#Comment_430638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T12:46:41+00:00" title="April  7, 2014 12:46PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG<br/><br/>Snargle needs to get a Glitter Boy. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430896/#Comment_430896" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-13T00:56:26+00:00" title="April 13, 2014 12:56AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played again recently.  Much fun was had.<br/><br/>The GM ruled that Mega Damage works much like in the books, IE massive overkill.  You'll need a very good explanation as to why you aren't checking the "Dead" box when you need to check a condition. And MD armor basically means you can laugh at any non MD attack.<br/><br/>Naomi decided that because we were now in a PPE rich environment, that she was capable of causing Mega-Damage and spent experience on "Secret of the Mega Damage Punch".  This is important.<br/><br/>So we start making our way down from the mountain top, and it's getting warmer.  Like a lot warmer.  We are not in Canada.  The air is choked with dust and we can't get a good look at the surrounding areas.<br/>Uriah start flipping his shit, because what the hell went wrong, and where the hell are we, and oh man, we're fucked.<br/>Lady B is becoming much less charmed with Uriah, as he's a panicky man in this environment.  Little does she know.<br/>The winds die down a bit and we see that the winds were apparently being controlled by a wizard, riding on the front of a tank, his wand held in front of him.  He gestures and the winds take off, blasting a huge crowd of unarmed men.  The moon is high in the sky.<br/>The tank starts firing MD blasts into the crowd of dudes, but they're totally getting back up!<br/>Then the wizard's back up arrives, a phalanx of guys in cyberpunk templar armor, all wielding two handed wooden crosses.<br/><br/>Uriah's like" Oh shit.  Mexico."<br/><br/>That was the first five minutes of our session. <br/><br/>By the end of the session, Kale's jumping around in stolen power armor, holding onto the back of a Vampire lord, while Lady B tries to hold a lightning bolt still enough to use it's light to cast the shadow of a cross that the captain is holding up.  Snargle is piloting a barely functioning Coalition skycycle near the mouth of an open volcano, blasting a rising army of fire elementals, being summoned forth by the wizard from earlier, who got vamped.  And Naomi?  She's trapped in a tank, punching the heads off of dozens of vampires, all constantly regenerating, until she realizes she has no hope of defeating them.  So she punches a hole <b>through</b> the tank to make an escape route.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
