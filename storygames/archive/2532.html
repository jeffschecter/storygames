You're welcome to join us if you're willing and able.<br/><br/>Second, has anyone else tried this? It's basically just an open invitation for anyone to come and play a specific game at a specific time. I've done this a few times - with Mridangam, Downtown (local game), and Lacuna (amazing game!). Others have done it, too - it's an open thing, so anyone can set a time and game and invite people, <i>as long as it's open for everyone</i>.

We are a group of people who didn't know each other well beforehand, who meet up once a fortnight to play 4-8 session runs of different games.  The ideal is that we play games that are new to us or try things we haven't done before.  We've had playing of games people never got to play before, we've had first time GMing, and lots of fun.<br/><br/>It hasn't had as much discussion and review as I initally envisaged, but it's working ok.

On the other hand, I see folks on local lists advertise open gaming events (Bowen's minis events at Lost Goblin, our mini-cons, etc) that often attract at least enough folks to play.  It's such that I actually have to watch where I post locally for a gaming meetup/day ("salon", as it seems to be used here) so as not to attract too many people.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58471/#Comment_58471" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T07:05:26+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  7:05AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are different gangs that intersect and share folks, true - I'm pretty selective in what I want to play, so a lot of the pick-up gaming that's being arranged on the lists is noise to me.

In Seattle, for example, I had no responsibilities besides work, and so I could schedule accordingly. Now I have lots of responsibilities and so do most people I know, which gets in the way. The monthly meetups I tried to run here didn't work, but I think the biggest parts of that was lack of location and lack of salesmanship by me.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have no solution, but this is my holy grail of gaming for our area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58504/#Comment_58504" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T11:05:21+00:00" title="March  1, 2007 11:05AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Space and location are problems in NYC.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe occasionally organize boardgame nights at thinkcoffee but the space wouldn't work for RPGs.
