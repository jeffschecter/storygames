It's an opportunity to connect with potential playtesters<br/><br/><b>Principles for posting:</b><br/><br/>* Tell us about your game(s) in one post. Feel free to mention your game even if you've talked about it in last month's thread. The idea is to inform us about what you're doing now.<br/><br/>* Optionally: tell us what you're hoping to achieve this month or what you did last month.<br/><br/>* If you want to link to another thread, post, or rules document, go for it.<br/><br/>* There's no maximum number of games you can talk about. If developing your game is a genuine focus for you this month, then put it up. (This bit is definitely an experiment, so let's test how it works. If the thread gets a bit spammy, then maybe we need a different/actual limit.)<br/><br/><br/><b>If you're responding to a game someone else has posted about:</b><br/><br/>* Number your response (first response: [1]; second response [2]; third response [3]). If you see that you're the second person to post, "Wow, that looks cool!" to a post here, then put a "[2]" at the top of your post. <br/><br/>* The fourth person to post should just take their comment and create a new thread (or talk on an existing thread about the game), to continue the discussion.<br/><br/><br/><b>Previous Threads</b><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19943/games-in-playtesting-development-january-2015" rel="nofollow">January 2015</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20002/games-in-playtesting-development-february-2015" rel="nofollow">February 2015</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20064/games-in-playtesting-development-march-2015" rel="nofollow">March 2015</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444612/#Comment_444612" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-07T12:48:16+00:00" title="April  7, 2015 12:48PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We are working on our wuxia RPG <i><a href="http://www.bedrockgames.net/Wandering-Heroes-of-Ogre-Gate.html" rel="nofollow">Wandering Heroes of Ogre Gate</a></i>. I believe I mentioned the system last month. This month our focus is on increasing the number of pressure point Kung Fu Techniques in the system and combing over existing techniques for issues. We are also working on setting material. <br/><br/>I am running a campaign and that is helping me to check a lot of the GM section material and the rules for things like Fate, Grudges, Luck, etc. This is our second full length campaign, we've also done mini-campaigns and lots of isolated play tests of the system components.

It uses minimalistic rules and aesthetics they can relate to any computer rpg they have played previously.<br/><br/>Good things:<br/>-20 min setting creation brainstorm worked wonderfully; making a fillable form with all the pertinent questions included was way better that explaining world creation in the core manual. Unexperienced players were able to use the material in that way.<br/>-Players got the feel of the rules and improvised rulings on their own, based in their experience with computer RPGs and their intuition, little guidance about that was needed.<br/>-Character creation went even quicker and players got the characters they wanted, creating special skills by their own. I was surprised no one made anything able to break the game, though I prepared for that a bit.<br/>-Giving players some skills for free was a good move, there are basic ones everyone must have but always forget or just don't think will be neccessary.<br/><br/>Not so good things:<br/>-Armour options and localization of hits are no-go anymore. Armour as a skill isn't intuitive at all.<br/>-Social and mental hp weren't used, so I'm scratching them completely.<br/>-Keeping track of mana and projectiles was also complicated given the speed of the game,  though for resources that allowed more interesting actions it was totally right to keep track.<br/>-Things could have gone smoother if the whole group defined a collective goal at the start of the game, something that could work as the game premise. Otherwise, there's always somebody that may feel going antagonistic is the default mode, while it's something actually optional. Not everyone enjoys PvP action, specially when they haven't been informed that the game is going to be about that. I just added a new section to the world creation sheet that deals with this subject.<br/>-Added space on the character sheet for character background. Some players got quite creative about that at the table.<br/>-Eliminated the space for character's description, since one player mistook that part for the "character concepts" part, and I realized it was almost the same thing.<br/><br/>Next goals:<br/>-<del>Streamline armour mechanics</del> Now using armor durability as damage reduction when the character is hit, durability decreases by one if damage exceeds it.<br/>-<del>Clean up the character sheet, add more info about the character creation here and there, but keep it unobstrusive.</del> done<br/>-<del>Separate Advanced rules from simple ones</del> instead of advanced, I'm making a section on the book for optional rules<br/>-Added Tutotial Mode, where characters start with no class and get to meet the different trainers and choose their class by their own. Trainers are created by the players along with the GM.<br/>-Edit and rearrange the skill list<br/><br/>EDIT: current state of development. I'm having doubts with the title of the game, perhaps I'll go with "Offline" instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444789/#Comment_444789" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-13T19:54:55+00:00" title="April 13, 2015  7:54PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            March was very good for playtesting The Extraordinarily Horrible Children of Raven's Hollow.

Its primary iteration is designed for an intrigue game about experts rather than heroes, unused to and vulnerable to the violence that goes along with heroism. Its combat system, when, with a twitch from the thread of the dangling sword of Damocles, it is brought out uses a "Threat" mechanic to place the primary goal of the scene to "escape" the enemy. It encourages and incentivises horizontal thinking by providing very loose rules surrounding a spend system not unlike that of GUMSHOE.<br/><br/>The concept is very solid and it is in a playable state, but I'd call the mechanics fluid and somehow skeletal. Its advancement and incentive system is practically nonexistent, but most other facets of the game are present in a prototype state. <br/><br/>I'm hoping to get a couple of more games in this month to test some mechanical adjustments, perhaps even the first playtest with a group outside my own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444794/#Comment_444794" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-14T00:57:03+00:00" title="April 14, 2015 12:57AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[1] I'm totally intrigued by this title: \n<blockquote>The Extraordinarily Horrible Children of Raven's Hollow</blockquote>\nWhere can I find out more about it?

I'm designing it with portability of genre/setting in mind; I want it to be used for not only medieval court intrigue, but for 80s corporate weasels, neo-feudal space empires, or even for a contemporary primary election campaign.<br/><br/>It's a game where you play unlanded elites in the court of a recently deceased monarch. You're each angling to place your personal patron on the throne, while collectively engaged in a particular conspiracy to see some other aim brought about. You engage with and come up against other court denizens, their patrons, and different conspiracies, seeking favor and plotting against others as desired.<br/><br/>The resolution is entirely focused on interpersonal give-and-take. You say what you want from them, they say what they want from you, and hopefully things work out in our favor. I am very consciously trying to dial in on the through-line of the game and omit mechanics for anything else; physical combat is something that will almost never come up, so there's no huge block of rules for that, for example.<br/><br/>Right now I have a bunch of timed-campaign ideas I need to tackle more fully, which will really help inform the flavor of the ruleset.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444847/#Comment_444847" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-17T22:27:20+00:00" title="April 17, 2015 10:27PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <b>DayTrippers GameMasters Guide</b> and new Core Rules are in playtests and final feedback stages.

My Games Galore plan this month is a short game called A Song About Maria, where you build three scenes in parallel (the verses) as you incrementally discover how they all turn out (the refrain).<br/><br/>Meanwhile my major projects:<br/><br/>1) Assembling the Magic Academy setting creation framework for Coming of Age and Fate Accelerated Edition is coming along with top level lists of magical subjects drafted and of magical aspects (tools and rules of magic) in progress. Lots more to do with creating the table entries. But I think I've figured out how to add Issues to FAE, which is important for me to make a dual system resource out of this. <i>Goal for the Month</i> get a few full entries done to make sure this doesn't need a change of approach.<br/><br/>2) I threw out my procedural table ideas for how to run Christmas Ninjas and I'm taking a tact with two pages of lists (think MC moves in Apocalypse World). One will be the GM's response sheet (for what happens when) and the other the GM's fact sheet (to help GM's present the insanity of the world). <i>Goal for the Month</i> Draft out the list of tables for these two sheets.<br/><br/>3) Getting some feedback on Sea of Black Stars, my procedurally defined strange fantasy setting for space exploration and plane hopping. It is good to take a step back even though a few of the tables have blank entries. Since I'll be using this setting in a 5th ed D&amp;D game, I have a fair bit of instantiating some setting elements into that system to do too. <i>Goals for the Month</i> Send out some parts of the Occultist class to its prospective player, finish Insect Swarm and Occupation tables, start planning out Languages and Currency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444916/#Comment_444916" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-23T06:18:32+00:00" title="April 23, 2015  6:18AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of these games sound great!

Hence space faring and plane hopping. I've been expanding on my plane generation tables I shared with folks a few years ago to make a unique meta setting which can be instantiated into a campaign's worth of detail by working through a web of random tables including characters, motivations, gods, myths, monstrosities, worlds, and wildlife.<br/><br/>This project has become something of a creative obsession, building the world via these tables. I haven't quite figured where to go with it past a tool for my own use.
