I grew up playing mostly AD&amp;D 2nd edition with a little bit of CoC, Feng Shui, Fading Suns, and Vampire. I went away to college and tried to fit into a few groups, but the social dynamics never worked out or I was just plain bored with the gameplay. I bought a lot of games over the years, including a few non-traditional ones like Sorcerer about five years years ago. I really felt like Sorcerer spoke to me, but I couldn't make sense of what exactly to do with it. After a few false starts of trying to get my own games going, I gave up RPGs completely and spent the last three years playing board and video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout two years ago I started a friendship with a few guys over Xbox live. Some of them are former gamers, though none of them play now. Recently, we got to talking about playing a game online. Although I had never played it, I thought Paranoia might be a good option since it's humor focused, requires little preparation, and little player knowledge. I'm going to be running the game through Google Wave starting in a week or so. I'll have five players, two of which never played an RPG before (though have always wanted to).<br/>\n<br/>\nI really want the game experience to have a clear focus. From reading Paranoia XP, it seems that the goal of the game is to generate as much nervous laughter as possible. Players are to use in-character skills, out-of-character knowledge, and try to curry my favor by being entertaining to get ahead. This isn't about getting into character, telling dramatic stories, or taking in the setting. I made a few minor changes to the rules and one big one - Perversity Modifiers don't have an in-game effect; they are a pure metagame resource. As written, they were kind of odd since they introduced inconsistent modifiers into the "gamespace". I thought I might have trouble reconciling them with the real modifiers. (The book mentions that Perversity Modifiers exist so you don't have to use real modifiers, but real modifiers are suggested all throughout the skill and mutant power sections.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm feeling pretty confident going into this as I consider these guys friends. We talk almost every day and can talk about things other than gaming. I think they'll be fairly forgiving of my mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I plan to post updates in Actual Play from time to time. For now, I would like to know if my perception of Paranoia as a game is accurate and whether my change to the Perversity Modifiers seems okay. Also, although the book suggests it in several places, I am against fudging rolls or making arbitrary changes to the way things work. It doesn't seem to me like you need to do those things to get the game to work well. Am I off base on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262547/#Comment_262547" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T12:51:41+00:00" title="March 17, 2010 12:51PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously, don't sweat Paranoia's rules or your modifications. The only thing worth worrying about is getting everyone into the same fictional headspace. Maybe you go around the table for a while playing "I don't see it" - basically, starting with a random player and going left, everyone says a sentence about the setting or the people in it, and you keep going until someone says "I don't see it." When that happens, stop; everything before that statement is true from that point on. Toss out the one that provoked a disagreement and start again. Go around until everyone has added at least two details to the game. Alternately, you just have an unstructured conversation to get everyone's visions converged, but hey, gamers love games!<br/><br/>Once the players internalize the flavor of the game, it really does just about run itself. I've never had a bad game of Paranoia, any edition, having run it for ten groups of strangers, and it has nothing to do with the rules and everything to do with the way the book evokes a target-rich environment for enjoyable fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262566/#Comment_262566" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T14:00:01+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  2:00PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if you have a group that is accustomed to AD&amp;D style adventuring and team-playing, Paranoia could be mindblowingly awesome. <br/><br/>Just run it in much the same way you would run a stereotypical adventure - what with the adventurers being given a clear goal, the promise of a reward and a way to assess the situation, time to develop a strategy and then going through with it by cleverly working together and helping each other out.<br/><br/>All you have to do as a GM in Paranoia is run the game that way, with the small caveat of constantly making the characters paranoid about everybody and everything around them. Be it each other, the NPCs, the room they are in, their equipment, the highest power (i.e. the Computer) or even the GM himself.<br/><br/>And the best way to do that, is by taking a page of all the things that the book/setting suggest to screw with... and have the players run into stuff that should make them suspicious. Things that should have their alarmbells ringing, that should make it clear to them that if they don't try to outsmart whoever is mucking about with their characters, they will likely end up as dust-heaps under a scrubot somewhere.<br/><br/>Many people seem to think that Paranoia is a game where the GM is supposed to hose the players. While this is great for a one-shot game, it really sells Paranoia short. In many ways Paranoia is sort of the wild, rock'n'roll sibling of a regular RPG in the vein of AD&amp;D. Whereas there are things you can rely on in an AD&amp;D campaign... running Paranoia is all about chipping away each and every one of those securities (both in- and out-of-game) until the panicked behaviour, fear-fuled betrayal and second-guessing scheming of the players ends in a great, big ball of carnage, destruction and snitching.<br/><br/>The snitching is probably the most hillarious aspect of it all. Just keep in mind that the players should always know when you're switching between GM, Computer and being their gaming buddy Nick. Otherwise things might get a little awkward when the first characters end up dieing for no apparent reason, while you are cackling away behind your screen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nick_Dalton" title="Nick_Dalton"><img alt="Nick_Dalton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/aug06/garthmarenghi2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nick_Dalton">Nick_Dalton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262669/#Comment_262669" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T07:18:12+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  7:18AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ccreitz: I'm not sure I understand your "I don't see it" suggestion. Is this exercise just to give player's a little input on the setting? I'm not sure this group would be comfortable with something like that and I'm afraid it would conflict with the "fear and ignorance" thing. Thanks for the reassurance on the rule mods.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorgios: Great advice!

Also, the players should screw each other over <i>the whole time</i>. You walk a thin line between <i>actually</i> hosing the players and <i>pretending</i> to hose the players.<br/><br/>The examples tell you how the game runs. Read them and internalise the style. <br/><br/>Also, the first time you run it, run it as written. Don't change the rules (is my advice). Until you play, you won't know what those rules do. Perversity Modifiers are there to encourage players to screw each other over.<br/><br/>That said, the style is much, much more important than the rules. You could run Paranoia with any system, honestly. What's important is the style of play. (Hence the fudging of die rolls. Fudging die rolls actually <i>adds</i> to play, because the rules aren't that important, and the GM hosing the players <i>is</i> important.)<br/><br/>Try running a published adventure, first? Mister Bubbles, in the rulebook, looks good (I haven't played it, but it looks well-structured).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
