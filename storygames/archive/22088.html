                    So, I think we need to talk about this. Just as we like to talk about how pivotal the early 2000's were in terms of early story game design, the Forge, etc., in thinking about this more recently I think there was a parallel trend going on in the trad world that is under-discussed.<br/><br/>I think that, completely independent of Ron Edward's criticisms, the trad TTRPG world recognized that it had a problem around the turn of the millenium. From TSR CEO Lorraine Williams driving it into the ground (leading to the takeover by WotC, with their own design philosophy), to Vampire the tabletop game beginning to lose out to Vampire LARP, to just overall dissatisfaction with almost two decades of railroaded adventure design as the norm (DragonLance was 1983), there were many people who were dissatisfied with the current state of the art.<br/><br/>I propose that WotC's takeover of D&amp;D from TSR marks the beginning of what we might call the Trad Reformation. (I'd argue that it ends in about 2008, but I'm getting a little ahead of myself.) Let's really consider D&amp;D3.0 (aka "3E"), the first modern edition of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, 3E was an attempt to do two things:<br/><br/>(1) Have the game make sense mathematically<br/><br/>(2) Because the mechanics would now be reliable, empower players' choices to matter — not thematic choices, but to give players real control over their characters' engagement with the game's subsystems (spellcasting, shapeshifting, etc.)<br/><br/>It's hard to overstate what a wild, wild departure this was from 1E and 2E. Those editions emphasized DM fiat, random chargen, and frankly nonsensical product development. So, even though, as a design, 3E largely failed to meet its goals, they were distinct from those of prior editions—and much more respectable. <br/><br/>Note, also, how much those failed goals of 3E overlap with the Forgite doctrine:<br/><br/>-They wanted to do away with the idea that the GM is god (even though they still made some nods to this in the DMG)<br/><br/>-They wanted rules that would, if followed, deliver a specific kind of experience, reliably<br/><br/>While the Forge has had an enormous influence on the history of TTRPGs, the timing of the Trad Reformation marks it as an example of parallel development, one over which the Forge had no influence. (Much like how Luke Crane and Jake Norwood wrote Burning Wheel and Riddle of Steel completely separately, despite some significant overlap between those games, on several levels!) It was only later on that the two trends in game design could begin to influence each other.<br/><br/>It also isn't the Forge and story gaming that led to the rise of the OSR. The rise of the OSR was in no small part a reaction against the codification and "video gamey ness" of WotC D&amp;D, aka the Trad Reformation.<br/><br/>Since about 2008, pretty much every major development in TTRPGs can be viewed as situated somewhere along or within the triangle formed by Forge + diaspora, Reformed Trad, and OSR. Unreformed Trad has really faded in relevance; while there are still many gamers who cling to the idea of the all-powerful GM, there are relatively few prominent designs that don't at least try to get the math right, that don't at least try to be playable out of the box. Recognizing what happened at WotC circa 2000 is a missing piece of understanding the history of recent TTRPG design.                </div>

                            For me, the third option (OSR [and proto-OSR like the Knights of the Dinner Table] and Story Now games being the two other ones) has been neo-trad games a la Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark.<br/><br/>I honestly saw the 3e era as sort of the ultimate excesses of the 90s game writ large: the rules on the player side grew <i>even more</i> complicated and cumbersome, and the culture of "DM, do wtf you want, change monster hp and die results to suit your needs" [a la Matt Colville] to definitely be alive and well. Sites like EN World and Paizo's own forums being places where this culture lived on. Since I see this split [<i>heavy</i> player book, bullshitty storyteller guide] as the defining feature of the 90s style game it's hard to see 3e as a very big leap from that. The 3e games that <i>had</i> rules setup for the DM like <i>West Marches</i> and <i>Advanced Wizards &amp; Wizards</i> bumped shoulders with a looot of games ran in the 90s style.<br/><br/>Between 3e and 4e there is a bigger break. [Book of Nine Swords etc being something I had never heard of.] 4e is… just such a unique experience that it's hard to fit it among any of the main line traditions. It sorta reminds me of Three Sixteen and Rune.                        </div>

                            There was definitely an instance of the right hand not knowing what the left was doing in terms of the development of 3E. And by "development" I actually mean a couple of things:<br/><br/>-The crafting of the rules engine<br/>-The evolution of its play culture<br/>-The deployment of its supplement treadmill<br/><br/>Those three things definitely did not work in harmony with each other!<br/><br/>So, I don't disagree that there was and is still a strong culture of Trad Gaming and all its problematic aspects among 3E players (including everyone into Pathfinder). BUT, because the player-facing charop minigame is really centralized, I have found in practice that there are some types of GM Fiat bullshit that it's harder for Viking hat GMs to get away with. In particular, anything that feels like an arbitrary nerf of a player ability tends to be looked at askance. (Players are less likely to detect cheating in their favor.)<br/><br/>Yes, between 3E and 4E is a bigger break, which is why I believe the Trad Reformation era ends in 2008, and begins the Era of Synthesis.<br/><br/>I don't know anything about <i>Wrath of the Righteous</i>.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a> : thanks for the compliment! <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> </div>

                            Good stuff. I always like the historical reviews - rpg theory is often much too concerned with conceptual issues and too dismissive of understanding the history of the form. As everybody who's ever tried to write history knows, it's far from trivial. Even things you've lived through yourself are often too large and complex to somehow "know" just because you happened to experience a random cross-section of the events yourself.<br/><br/>I don't have much to add to Deliverator's analysis. 3e D&amp;D indeed was a major watershed for its sheer popularity; it captured market shares among old-timer roleplayers so effectively that it was pretty much responsible for finishing the job on throttling the old trad play culture dead on a demographic level. It's not like there still wasn't some trad play going on afterwards, or that we would have somehow magically forgotten how to play <i>Fading Suns</i>, but the balance of play definitely shifted. I like the phrasing "trad reformation" for this shift, yes. It was the biggest revolution in the relatively conservative progress of trad gaming since the Vampire thing (which doesn't have a name in our history-writing as far as I know - I mean the shift of emphasis from the '80s "engineer rpgs" into '90s "big story" rpgs).<br/><br/>I've generally called the resulting era of trad rpg development the "neo-trad era". Its characteristic feature has been the reshuffling of the play culture into a hard core of D&amp;D "grind gaming" (charop and skirmish fighting filled big rulebook RAW fantasy adventure games) surrounded by a softer nimbus of more traditional games that often introduce minor innovations from outside traditions. The grind gaming hasn't quite separated entirely into its own thing, just as D&amp;D never quite detached from the rpg hobby it spawned through the earlier decades, either, but the cultural distance is so large that it is easy to find grind gamers for whom a more '90s style trad game already qualifies as exotic.                        </div>

                            The nice thing about more traditional, or traditional-seeming games that draw on more progressive design influences is that you can play them with people who might be turned off by a hardcore story-game. In that sense, both FFGSW and Apocalypse World / Dungeon World (etc.) are relevant. Both are a familiar enough paradigm that you can plop them down with folks who have heretofore never played anything but D&amp;D and they'll do just fine. That's not necessarily the case with MLWM or Burning Empires.                        </div>

                            Very true. <br/><br/>Although I think the “neo-trad” games (like Apocalypse World, Blades in the Dark, maybe FATE, and others) seem to be mostly derived from the story game tradition, curving back towards traditional play rather than the other way around. We’re starting to see some games which definitely fall into that camp which do not come from that lineage, though (perhaps like the Star Wars game you’re talking about, Trail of Cthulhu, and Mutant Year Zero).<br/><br/>Matt, has that game taken the place of your home brew Star Wars rules in your gaming life? Do they have any meaningful overlap?                        </div>

                            Yeah, I haven't really looked at my own personal Star Wars system in awhile. The existence of FFGSW + Scum and Villainy kind of makes it unnecessary. My game *is* much more of a straight-up Star Wars story-game, however.                        </div>

Mutant Year Zero def does come from that lineage. It just has two mommies; the license/setting of the old Mutant game and the rules design of people who read/play a lot of <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a>.<br/><br/>The first couple of versions of Fate seemed more like their own thing; maybe by the time Spirit of the Century and Fate Core rolled around it had picked up some influence from the other indies.

Namely that Paizo's writers are garbage.

I believe this could be characterized as a reaction to these changes.

Aside from the generic plot point predetermination, I recall a mandatory scene where Iomedae (goddess of justice) summons the party to her court, quizzes them, and smites them if they answer incorrectly or backsass.                        </div>

Yes, exactly, the total incoherence of the four strands (mechanics design, play culture, adventure design, splatbook / supplement design) lead to exactly that cycle.                        </div>

                            As for my SW game of choice: there's something about the FFG SW I just really enjoy. I've so far stayed away from delving too deeply into the gear porn and other excessively crunchy aspects of the game. My plan has always been, if I have a player who really cares about that stuff, to put them in charge of learning and implementing those rules. If I had a player who was deeply invested in, say, modding their B-Wing, I'd be much more willing, as a GM, to go there with them, but on my own, it's not the aspect of SW I care about the most.                        </div>

                            Looking back to the OP:<br/><br/>1 - Vampire was never "supplanted" by the Vampire LARP. The tribulations of the MET was in monetization, not in publication.  The peak of MET in the late 1990s was a genuine LARP movement, but White Wolf simply couldn't take advantage of it.  Membership fees couldn't be collected because the benefits of membership were questionable.  Publications were also questionable because unlike the tabletop game, MET LARPs didn't have a single all-fictionally-powerful creative director.  They relied on player-created content far too much for the publication model to support.  MET was a very big deal but White Wolf simply never cracked how to make the money from it that clearly was out there.  I have my own theories on why that is, but to say that it was more important to White Wolf than publication is ahistorical.  White Wolf's money still came from publications.  <br/><br/>White Wolf's decisionmaking in the early 2000s, especially with respect to the launch of Vampire: the Requiem and the "blue book" era of World of Darkness, fits with the historical movement you describe, however. The fictional world had gotten too unwieldy and contained far too many strange side-tangents and bug fixes to be effective.  Looking at what changes actually got made when turning to Requiem, it was a streamlined, unified system with improved probability designs.  The setting was also simplified and presented as a more explicit toolbox than the supplements the audience had gotten used to in the 1990s.<br/><br/>2 - Any look back at 3e has to take into account the idea of a financial restructuring of the D&amp;D business.  The idea was that the OGL would permit WOTC to get out of the adventure creation business except for specific targeted ideas (the introductory adventure, the big mythic location, etc.)  The intended result was to make the corebooks increasingly evergreen products which would be supported by enthusiasts connected to competitor's brands.  In this respect 3e (and then 3.5e) was a phenomenal, overwhelming success.<br/><br/>3 - Historically, the early OSR games (Castles and Crusades, OSRIC) post-date the 3e boom a little too much for your account to work.  The proto-OSR games were created and spread because WOTC pulled its PDFs off the site it was selling them at, svgames.com.  Although they made comforting noises, the feeling among fans was that they would return to the TSR anti-piracy/anti-fan-site crackdown era and make it virtually impossible for previous publications to be viable in terms of gathering a knowledgeable group.  These were explicitly reactions not to artistic changes in terms of 3e's direction, but material consumer product availability changes.  The OSR as specifically an artistic movement didn't take off until 4e "destroyed D&amp;D".  (In fact, in early Castles and Crusades material you can often see 3e-isms creeping in around the sides....)  The original need of the OSR to keep alive early systems and early material is gone with the embrace of digital publishing by WOTC, so you don't see a lot of Castles &amp; Crusades or OSRIC discussions in OSR spaces these days - you can just buy AD&amp;D and play that!  Thus, what remains is primarily centered on a set of aesthetic priorities formulated in the 4e era and the games played/discussed/advanced reflect that.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall a good theory. I definitely think there was a "revised" era for many games in the era you describe, and not just because of the d20 boom (though certainly in some cases it fuelled it; see Traveller for the biggest example.)                        </div>

                            Great additions to the discussion, JD!<br/><br/>I'm less well-versed in the history of Vampire and White Wolf than in that of D&amp;D, in particular, so knowing that they also tried to streamline in the early 2000's is fascinating.<br/><br/>I think the fact that the LARP stuff was un-monetizable is precisely the reason it seemed more cool to a lot of gamers in the late 90's. Which, as you say, was bad for WW!<br/><br/>Regarding the OSR, I think it's a fair point that it only really got going around the time of 4E. I've definitely talked to a lot of OSR people, and read on blogs, that they didn't like the codification and standardization of either 3E or 4E, though.<br/><br/>And yes, no question that 3E + the OGL (aka "the d20 boom / d20 glut") were phenomenally successful from a commercial point of view. I was merely commenting on the fact that on the whole, the Trad Reformation only solved a few small problems and mainly created new ones.                        </div>

                            One problem with this theory/idea (or maybe it’s not a problem!):<br/><br/>Doesn’t this mean that the current most popular game - 5e - is a throwback to the trad era? I mean, it seems far less Reformed than 3e or 4e, doesn’t it?<br/><br/>If not, what features do you feel qualify it as part of the Reformation? (I could see the argument that the math is far more “balanced”, for example, but I don’t know whether a) that produces a meaningfully different play experience, if we assume everything else, including culture of play, is the same, and b) whether other trad games of the pre-Reformation era didn’t have that kind of rigorous design.)                        </div>

                            5e is a game that the designers have said is explicitly informed by the OSR and by Fate and AW/DW.<br/><br/>They went back and played every edition. I see a lot of Rules Cyclopedia era stuff in 5e. I have it sorted among OSR games. I hate 3e pretty much.

                            Paul, read the damn 5E books. Seriously. And play it with some people who aren't morons. It's far, far, far more balanced than 3E ever was, more streamlined and has much better support for non-fiat play than *any* other edition of D&amp;D since Basic.                        </div>

                            Matt,<br/><br/>I guess I have to take your word for it... as you know, my first experience was playing the Wild Magic Sorcerer, which, as you yourself basically explained to me was screwed up, design wise, demands the GM to adjudicate things in a very particular way to make sense at all, and is clearly worse than the alternative (the Draconic Sorcerer).  <br/><br/>I’d be very curious to hear how 5e enables play that’s more... modern... than 3e or 4e, but obviously I won’t twist anyone’s arm if they don’t want to tell me. (I didn’t start this thread, after all!)<br/><br/>Everything I’ve heard about the game from friends and online suggests that the reason it’s been so successful is precisely the opposite: because it’s looser, with more places for fiat and rulings on the spot, more like older editions of D&amp;D. At least, that’s what people talk about and seem to enjoy the most. So I dunno. <br/><br/>The idea that 5e has “much better support for non-fiat play” than 3.5 or Pathfinder is entirely new to me, so I’m stating my surprise. Online, people seem to praise 5e because it doesn’t try as hard to codify and leaves more room for interpretation than the rather over-designed 3e, never mind the frustratingly perfect balance of 4e; I got the impression that people enjoy 5e precisely because it’s rougher around the edges and therefore shows more variety.<br/><br/>I don’t think it’s fair to call the type of play I was involved in (Deliverator and I had a long discussion a few years ago about a particular D&amp;D campaign I played in) as by “morons”. I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent gamer, and yet I don’t feel like I know how to fix the problems that came up (without house-ruling important parts of the game; which *everyone* who has posted about playing 5e here on Story Games has done, including Deliverator).<br/><br/>I’m also not familiar enough with other trad RPGs from the late 90s forward... but surely at least some of them had mathematically capable design? I don’t know - some of the d20 line (Mutants &amp; Masterminds), Savage Worlds, EABA? GURPS 4th Ed? Not an expert here... just surprised. <br/><br/>However, I recently played a board game called Kingdom Death, which struck as being quite interesting from a design perspective. I could see this kind of design being a real exemplar or “endpoint” of this new trend you’re suggesting: very regimented and careful design from step to step, everything “automated” (there are decks of cards that enable enemy AI, effectively, for instance), high production values, lots of incredible art, and so forth. I could see that being a sort of “flagship” for a very particular generation of games.<br/><br/>Not trying to stir up trouble, you understand. I’m just surprised, so I’m expressing my confusion.                        </div>

5e does not provide any strong support for non-fiat play. The skill checks are virtually all matters of GM fiat: the GM agrees to allow a skill check, then he sets the DC, then the players roll the dice. There are typically defined skill checks within an adventurer, but the rest of the system is rather loose, and one need look no further than the marked success of Critical Role to witness this '90s playstyle phenomenon as thriving.
<blockquote>Everything I’ve heard about the game from friends and online suggests that the reason it’s been so successful is precisely the opposite: because it’s looser, with more places for fiat and rulings on the spot, more like older editions of D&amp;D.</blockquote>
Agreed.
<blockquote>surely at least some of them had mathematically capable design? I don’t know - some of the d20 line (Mutants &amp; Masterminds), Savage Worlds, EABA? GURPS 4th Ed? Not an expert here... just surprised. <br/></blockquote>
The majority were garbage. I would say there are a handful of games that work reasonably well in terms of numerical design, but perhaps by accident. The BRP family seems to work well enough, if only for mathematical transparency, FUDGE for similar reasons, Savage Worlds because the numerical range is fairly tight.                        </div>

                            Look, anyone who can't run a round of combat in 5E, even in a fairly complex, climactic fight, in under 15 minutes, is a complete idiot who needs to find a new hobby. Period. That has nothing to do with house-rules. Those people **didn't know the <b>actual</b> rules**. That was eminently clear from your descriptions of the game. Not my weird house-ruled stuff, not my bizarre but technically RAW fixation on Inspiration, I mean just the basic combat mechanics.<br/><br/>I've seen this exact phenomenon almost every time I've tried to play a trad game: the GM and the other players don't even know what's in the books. Since that's a major "feature" of unreformed trad play, sure, it's possible to play 5E that way, or any game. I've seen it done with Burning Wheel, and it sucked.<br/><br/>The only trad game from the 90's with even reasonable math was Earthdawn 2E. Possibly 3E as well but I know it less well. However, its GM-facing stuff was predictably terrible. All the other 90's designs were written by people who truly know no math at all, or at least didn't apply that knowledge to their designs. Awful.<br/><br/>As for why 5E is far less fiat-dependent than 3E (but possibly more than 4E--don't lump those together): it's precisely because it's less complex. It's fairly easy for GMs to adjudicate unexpected things in a way that's fair and transparent.<br/><br/>In the longest 5E game I played in (not GM'd), there was a scene where a monster swallowed one character ( <a href="/forums/profile/DBB">@DBB</a> 's), and the paladin deliberately got swallowed to go rescue her. He then lit a lantern to try to make the monster sneeze them both out before they died from its stomach acid. Now, there was nothing explicit in the rules about how to make a monster sneeze, but the GM very sensibly set a DC for a Con save and rolled. There were a few other things in that scene where the GM had to extrapolate from the existing rules how to handle the characters' intents. And while he didn't necessarily make the exact calls I would have, the important thing is that his reasoning was clear, the dice rolls all mattered, etc.<br/><br/>Again, this was someone with much less theory background than me, and no experience running anything other than 5E.<br/><br/>In 4E, such actions wouldn't be hard to adjudicate, but would be hard to make feel organic because of this thing called the p. 42 problem. (Long story, not germaine.) In 3E, by contrast, unless your character was exactly built to dive into monsters' stomachs to rescue Gnomes, then by the rules you simply would have no chance of succeeding at something like this. Such that if the GM did try to improvise to make such a venture possible, they'd end up invalidating the choices made by someone who did invest in the exact right feat chain.<br/><br/>Now, there are some things in 5E where the looseness of the design is a bit problematic. The fact that every group has to figure out exactly how they want to handle Perception vs. Investigation, and Perception vs. Insight, is a problem. The game does need a 5.5 pass. Tool use was clarified in Xanathar's Guide. Etc. But fundamentally, when people online talk about it being looser, they don't generally mean that GMs can just do whatever they want. They mean that it isn't a straitjacket, which both 3E and 4E were (albeit in hugely different ways).                        </div>

                            4eD&amp;D made the very slightest move towards mechanical consistency between different character types and that move was heralded as the end of the world, death, doom, destruction, a vicious personal attack on each and every D&amp;D player, and after the usual Christmas firings, they put a team in charge of it that walked it all back in Essentials. In fact, I would say that the publication of the 4eD&amp;D player's guide in December 2007 was The Beginning Of The End for the streamlining and consistency of trad approaches, and September 2010, when Essentials came out, was the absolute end of what the OP describes as the Trad Reformation.                        </div>

                            Ok, so this has me majorly confused. You've established a "trad reformation", and its features, and then you're saying that it was "over" around 2010 or so, but when I say that D&amp;D 5e looks more like a pre-reformation game, you tell me I've got it wrong. Help me understand! Is 5e part of the "reformation", its apotheosis, or a slightly regressive game which borrows some influence from it?<br/><br/>I'll go point by point:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>[...] Look, anyone who can't run a round of combat in 5E, even in a fairly complex, climactic fight, in under 15 minutes, is a complete idiot who needs to find a new hobby. Period.</p></div></blockquote>
I'm not going to argue about the specifics here (I find it vaguely offensive, because *I* would have trouble running a fairly complex fight in under 15 minutes, and most fights take 2-6 rounds, anyway, which means the fight is still easily an hour long - Critical Role's stats show an average combat duration of one hour, so that backs this up), but here's the important bit:<br/><br/>Are you saying that "running a round of combat in under 15 minutes" is a hallmark of the Trad Reformation? I can't tell.<br/><br/>It seems to me that lots of pre-Reformation games ran very fast; surely the slow and very battlemat-based combat of something like 3e/4e/other new RPGs would be the NEW thing here, and therefore a Reformation feature? <br/><br/>How is 5e's relative speed not a return to an earlier school of design, then?
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The only trad game from the 90's with even reasonable math was Earthdawn 2E. Possibly 3E as well but I know it less well. [...] All the other 90's designs were written by people who truly know no math at all, or at least didn't apply that knowledge to their designs. Awful.</p></div></blockquote>
I'm not widely enough read in the 90s RPG repertoire to hold a debate on this, but I remember some good games from the period. Greg Porter's games were incredible works of mathematical elegance, for example (although I could easily see that being an outlier rather than an exemplar!). GURPS certainly tried, despite some issues (which you agree even 5e has, after all).<br/><br/>So let's say that's correct. I honestly don't know. 
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>However, its [that is, 3E's] GM-facing stuff was predictably terrible.</p></div></blockquote>
Is 5e's "GM-facing stuff" meaningfully different from 3e and 4e? If so, is it more "Reformed" or less? <br/><br/>I'm asking out of curiosity; I'm not familiar enough with 3e and 4e to be sure. What I've read in 5e books so far seems not too different from what I remember in 90s games. <br/><br/>What might the hallmarks of "Reformed" GM-facing stuff be?<br/><br/>For instance, 5e has rules for "balanced encounters"; if they work well, that seems like somewhat of a "tell". I can imagine a system for "balanced encounters" being a Trad Reformation "ingredient" - typical of the movement/genre/style.<br/><br/>I seem to remember that AD&amp;D 2nd Edition had rules for this, too, but I never used them, so I couldn't comment on whethe it's more of the same or whether there's been a meaningful qualitative change in this department from 2E to 5E. (I would hope there has been, but I don't know what it is!)
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As for why 5E is far less fiat-dependent than 3E (but possibly more than 4E--don't lump those together): it's precisely because it's less complex. It's fairly easy for GMs to adjudicate unexpected things in a way that's fair and transparent.<br/><br/>[removed excellent example of on-the-spot ruling which might have been more difficult in 3e or 4e]<br/><br/>In 3E, by contrast, unless your character was exactly built to dive into monsters' stomachs to rescue Gnomes, then by the rules you simply would have no chance of succeeding at something like this. Such that if the GM did try to improvise to make such a venture possible, they'd end up invalidating the choices made by someone who did invest in the exact right feat chain.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
Again, I don't disagree with any of this at all, but I have no idea how it fits into the narrative you're spinning here. (I'm not arguing with it, by the way! Just trying to understand. I'd like to have a sort of mental model of trad RPG development over the last 20 years to lean on; that seems like a handy thing.)<br/><br/>So, 5e is meaningfully different from 3e and 4e (though perhaps in different ways) because it's less complex. Are you saying that pre-Reformation games were more complex or less complex? <br/><br/>My sense is that "make a saving throw to resolve the sneezing dragon" sounds like something very much more in the vein of a typical 90s RPG than a typical "Reformed" RPG; exactly in line with what I was saying about 5e being more of a "throwback" to an earlier era - that's what people seem to like about it. Having that flexibility is what you get when you don't have a rigorous and balanced system of feats and movement rules and tightly-bound economies. That, to me, sounds like a feature earlier designs had, not more modern ones. (My basic understanding is that in Basic D&amp;D, you'd make a saving throw or an ability check - which are basically the same thing in 5e - whereas in 3e, we'd look up some highly specific and involved rules for a specific situation like this and try our best to follow them to the letter, and whereas in 4e we'd either say "that's not an option; try something else" or find an abstract mechanic to determine the outcome, like a Skill Challenge or something of that sort.)<br/><br/>In short, I don't disagree with anything you're saying (except maybe the comments about the speed of combat <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ), but I don't understand why you're bringing these things up as a counterpoint, rather than supporting the view I was asking about. These all sounds like ways in which 5e is <i>separate from</i> or <i>a reaction to</i> the Reformation, in other words.<br/><br/>My sense is that the whole thing that's unusual about 5e is that it's taken more rigorous and streamlined design and math from the 3e and 4e school/era and combined it with a more loose, free-wheeling, old-school approach to play. It's kind of a hybrid, in other words, and that makes people like, say, <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> extremely happy (and understandably so), but isn't a good replacement for something more carefully circumscribed (like 3e/4e - I don't see someone like <a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">@Trent_W</a> seeing 5e as a good replacement for 4E, for instance) or hardcore OSR gamers (who find it overly limiting and defined, and the obsession with balance to be too "new school" for their tastes).<br/><br/>I'm not trying to rag on 5e, either - clearly it does a bunch of things really well, and makes people happy. I'm just trying to understand how it fits into this Reformation idea.<br/><br/>I'm also not an expert on any of this, and am woefully under-schooled on 3e and 4e, which I mostly avoided; I'm just here to listen and learn.                        </div>

In 4e, you would adjudicate this with Rule 42 (so named from page 42 of the DMG1) or an on-the-fly terrain power from the DMG2. In many significant ways, what <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> described here would be *much easier* to run with in 4e than in 5e precisely because it has more streamlined, consistent mechanics. (For example: in 4e the attacker always rolls an attack vs one of the enemy's 4 defenses --- whereas in 5e you return to the 3e paradigm of sometimes the attacker rolls, sometimes the defenders rolls, and sometimes both the attacker and defender roll. One of the reasons that <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> 's Players Always Roll approach is so neat is precisely because it is so much more consistent and logical than the 5e rules-as-written). <br/><br/>Just as an aside, one of the fundamental guidelines in both the DMG1 and DMG2 in 4e is Always Say Yes. Telling the player "no, you can't do that" is very much against the spirit and design of the game.
<blockquote>(like 3e/4e - I don't see someone like <a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">@Trent_W</a> seeing 5e as a good replacement for 4E, for instance)</blockquote>
I could swing with it, but it would take a lot of work and I'd end up just porting a bunch of stuff over from 4e and 13A.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

Agreed. The monsters now pretty much has a "dex defense" etc. <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> I was so glad to get away from all that "touch AC" "flatfooted" crap and just have one AC and now we're back to this, seven defenses<br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            FWIW, I don't particularly know what the right label is to put on 5E. It's sort of weirdly pre-Reformation Trad in terms of its stance on how GM authority should work—i.e., it doesn't really take a stance but kind of says it's okay to maybe fudge sometimes? (Except that it's easy to play it in a less dysfunctional way.) But it's also post-Reformation in terms of having actually good underlying math.<br/><br/>And, given the incredibly high levels of absolute GM asshattery I've dealt with, I don't really agree that "DM sets the DC for skill checks and calls for a roll" really makes 5E fiat-based. I mean, that's how most games work. What makes a game feel fiat-driven is if there are things where the GM just won't let you roll, or will refuse to set a DC, or the like.                        </div>

                            Agreed! (Although how a game informs the scope and stakes of such rolls, and how disciplined it allows the GM to be in setting the difficulty, is pretty instrumental in making it run more or less “objectively”. I don’t see a great deal of that in 5e, but maybe it’s made more clear in some of the materials I haven’t read.)<br/><br/>When you say “good underlying math”, are we just talking combat? Or are there other aspects of the game which 5e does clever things in which help with the gameplay somehow? (I suppose non-stacking Inspiration and advantage/disadvantage could belong in that category, if we read charitably.)                        </div>

Exhaustion levels, food foraging, spell casting, weather, it's just overall a system that's made by people who know what they are doing. Unlike the weather system in 2e that quickly spun into a never ending hurricane. (I guess they forgot about the golden rule of game design: always be testing.)                        </div>

                            Well, I see everyone in this thread talking about 3e but then saying they don't remember it very well.  It just happens that I have been running core D&amp;D 3e as recently as last fall.  <i>And loving it</i>, as Max Smart says.  So... ask me anything?<br/><br/>As for making monsters sneeze from the inside, here's the 5e MM on the purple worm, which I suppose is the most typical monster for swallowing people:
<blockquote>If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.<br/><br/>If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone. </blockquote>
And here's 3e:
<blockquote>A purple worm can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of crushing damage plus 8 points of acid damage per round from the worm's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 20). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. <br/> The worm's interior can hold one Huge, four Large, sixteen Medium-size, or sixty-four Small or smaller opponents.</blockquote>
I don't especially see anything about the two rules text blocks that provides the DM more guidance in the one game than the other for how the worm will react to lighting a fire in its gullet.  Why is the DM allowed to make up an adjudication in 5e but not in 3e?<br/><br/>By the way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080516065101/http://www.montecook.com/arch_dmonly33.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a short essay from Monte Cook about how the rules were supposed to work in 3e.
<blockquote><br/>Imagine this situation: Six bugbears block a 5-foot-wide doorway in two rows. The PC fighter just wants to get out of the room. The player says to the DM, "I want to charge the bugbears with my shield in front of me, and my weapon used to just ward away their blows. I don't care about hurting them -- I just want to get out, hopefully without taking too much damage."<br/><br/>This is a reasonable thing to try, albeit a difficult one to accomplish. While some DMs could come up with rules on the fly to handle the situation, many others would take a lot of time with it. A reasonable and action-oriented plan by a player could slow things way down. Further, even the on-the-fly-savvy DM runs the risk of forgetting how he handled it, and running a similar situation completely differently the next time, which can confuse and irritate players. Worst of all would be the situation where either because he can't think of how to handle it, or because it would take too long to figure it all out, the DM replies, "No, you can't do that."<br/><br/>When Jonathan Tweet, Skip Williams, and I designed 3rd Edition, we wanted something for the DM to be able to fall back on. We wanted to provide rules the DM had at his disposal that wouldn't be hard to adjudicate, wouldn't slow down the game (at least not too much), and wouldn't force him to say "no." Our attitude was, "Don't worry, DM. We've got your back."</blockquote>
Tells you a lot about what they intended in the reformation -- whether or not the typical 3e players understood all this at the time.                        </div>

                            One of my regrets about the way 3e is presented is that often the rule is presented without the derivation.  Grapple is an example: the grapple rule is (in my opinion) derived from several simpler rules, but the "rules behind the rules" are only somewhat obliquely stated.  The way they present it as a series of steps makes it seem like it is a unique procedure to memorize, whereas I suspect the designers must have at some point been thinking you would grasp the principles behind it and then use it as the basis to make your own adjudications.<br/><br/>I'll try the bugbear example.  First I'll do it off the top of my head, then check it against the book to see if I get it right.  I suppose that will tell me if I am smart enough for 3e!<br/><br/>Off the top of my head: he is trying to charge and overrun the bugbears.  He enters the first bugbear's space, so he provokes AoO's from the front row of bugbears (moving inside their reach).  His AC is at -2 because he's charging.  Then the bugbear in the middle has a choice--let this guy pass, or get in his way.  Bugbear decides to get in his way.  They collide.  Opposed strength checks.  Our man has +2 from his charge.  Our guy wins, bugbear is knocked prone.  So our man continues into the second row.  He provokes from the second row of bugbears, still at -2 AC (it lasts for a round).  Then opposed strength checks--at this point, no longer with the +2 bonus, since he spent the momentum on the first bugbear.  If he breaks through, he's free.  So, almost identical to 5e.<br/><br/>The one point I'm wavering on is whether bowling a bugbear down uses up a standard action, in which case he'd be forced to end his turn standing over the first bugbear.  I think he can do it, though--he's continuing his movement in the path of his charge.<br/><br/>Now let me check the book.  I'm sure this scenario is covered under an "overrun" manoeuvre, since Monte Cook said he has my back.  Here we are, PHB p. 139.
<blockquote>You can try to overrun as part of a charge action. You can only overrun an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller. You can make only one overrun attempt per action.<br/><br/>An overrun takes place during the movement portion of a charge.  With an overrun, you attempt to plow past or over your opponent (and move through his area).<br/><br/>First, you must move at least 10 feet in a straight line into the defender’s space (provoking attacks of opportunity normally).<br/><br/>Then the defender chooses either to avoid you or to block you. If he avoids you, you keep moving. (You can always move through the space occupied by someone who lets you by.) If he blocks you, make a trip attack against him (see Trip, below). If you succeed in tripping your opponent, you can continue your charge in a straight line as normal.<br/><br/>If you fail and are tripped in turn, you are prone in the defender’s space (see Table 8–8: Attack Roll Modifiers). If you fail but are not tripped, you have to move 5 feet back the way you came. If that space is occupied, you fall prone in that space.</blockquote>
Almost what I said, except instead of an opposed strength check, it is sending me to cross-reference under "Trip."  That's annoying, but I suppose logical because we wanted to knock the bugbears prone, which is technically a trip.  Checking the trip rules...
<blockquote>Make a melee attack as a melee touch attack. If the attack succeeds, make a Strength check opposed by the defender’s Dexterity or Strength check (whichever ability score has the higher modifier).</blockquote>
OK, so it's an opposed check after all, but the defender gets to use either Dex or Str to oppose, just like 5e (I guess that's where 5e took the rule from).  Not relevant in this case (since the bugbears will have higher strength than dex), but good to know.<br/><br/>Supposedly also there is a melee touch attack, but that feels like a bug in the rules; the characters already collided when the bugbear decided not to get out of the way of the charge.  Here I am appealing to the underlying principles as I understand them.  A touch attack is required whenever you want to touch someone and they don't want to let you--which applies in the case of a trip attack made normally, but wouldn't seem to apply in the case where you are incidentally running into someone while trying to get through their space.<br/><br/>Overall I will give myself a 4/5 on being smart enough to run 3e at 3:00 in the morning.  Points off for not realizing this could be considered a trip attack, but good job me for basically calling for the right rolls.  Also the rules do not say that he loses the +2 bonus after the first bugbear, so I guess I was wrong there, but I think I am actually right in terms of the logic of the situation.                        </div>

                            OK, cross-posted there.  Let me reply to what you added--<br/><br/>Ha, Monte Cooke is wrong, it's an overrun not a bull rush.  He wants to force his way past the bugbears, not push them down the hallway.  Funny.  I guess the rules really are a bit too hard.<br/><br/>5e presentation is certainly better.  In many ways, not just this one.  (Although, 3e presentation is better in a few other ways, just not in the case of combat manoeuvres.  For example, the spell lists have those nice one-line summaries so new players don't have to flip through the entire Spells chapters to choose their 7 spells at level 1...)<br/><br/>I sort of said it in my previous post, but the reason the 3e combat maneouvres (and other things) seem so overcomplicated is that they are sort of written as worked examples rather than as principles from which to derive the correct resolution.<br/><br/>The attacks of opportunity is another example.  It seems like there are a zillion things that provoke, but most of them fall under "moving within someone's reach without taking the withdraw action".  Grappling provokes an attack of opportunity because you have to move into someone's space to grapple them... which is within their reach.  Likewise in this case.<br/><br/>Other than that, you provoke by spellcasting and... basically doing anything else inside someone's reach that would require you to lower your shield or take your eyes off the other guy.  That covers ranged attacks, digging in your pack for a potion, throwing your head back to drink the potion, etc.  But <i>not</i> getting an item from Heward's Handy Haversack, because you just shove your free hand in there and the potion pops out automatically.<br/><br/>But yeah, the presentation makes you think you should constantly be checking the AoO column in the big tables, which is Not A Good Thing.<br/><br/>Whereas really the system works properly if you are keeping the image of the combat as clear as possible in your head and playing out the action in slow motion watching for the character's bodies to do things that trigger rules...                        </div>

                            It is true!  It only triggers if you move at least 5 feet... which is why there is a 5-foot step rule, although that sometimes creates more problems than it solves.<br/><br/>By the way, when you attack, only your weapon goes into the enemy space.  Obviously.  Whereas unarmed strikes <i>do</i> trigger because your hand goes across the magic invisible line into the other guy's square, obviously.  It's all obvious!<br/><br/>(Honestly, it took me ten years to see how obvious it was to Monte Cook and Jonathan Tweet and Skip Williams when they all got high and invented all the weird combat rules.  Had to go through 5e and Dungeon World and back before I realized what they were thinking,  Used to think Pathfinder was the simplified 3e, but now I find 3e simpler and more logical than Pathfinder...)<br/><br/>It is like those mathematicians who need ten minutes to see whether their proof is actually obvious...                        </div>

                            If I really think about it, I think there are four triggers:<br/> - You move more than 5 feet in one turn, with the starting space inside the enemy's reach.<br/> - You move into another character's space, not just their reach.<br/> - You do something physically that causes you to lower your guard (where "your guard" should be understood to mean actively dodging and parrying blows)<br/> - You do something mentally that causes you to lower your guard<br/><br/>The fact it is simply a mental problem for spellcasting is why you can make a Concentration check to cast a spell while still parrying blows (avoiding the AoO).<br/><br/>But you can't take a Concentration check to shoot a bow while dodging blows (because in that case you are physically lowering your guard, not just mentally).                        </div>

Rereading the bull rush page I concur, you're absolutely right. (In 5e I knew it was called overrun (or tumble for dex dorx) but in 3e I just took Cook's word for it.)

                            (afterthought to my previous post, not a response to your latest)<br/><br/>The 5e version where it triggers only when leaving the space is probably more elegant, though.  As long as there are no bonuses for flanking or circling it works really well.  And it fixes the stupid bug in 3e where the wizard always takes his five-foot step back <i>before</i> casting, thereby avoiding provoking... although of course that doesn't matter in 5e where casting doesn't provoke... but at least he is stuck with his penalty on ranged attacks.                        </div>

And it's a list such as this that I can't really find in 3e; you had to construct it from the other way around, right?

Right; when the DMG came out and it had the optional rule for flanking I though that was the stupidest thing I had seen in the entire game. The thief sneak attack rule did not need it. And if everything in the world grants free advantage, and advantage doesn't stack, how are you gonna get to do cool stuff to get advantage.<br/> </div>

<blockquote>And it's a list such as this that I can't really find in 3e; you had to construct it from the other way around, right?</blockquote>
Yes, you are right.<br/><br/>A small number of the underlying systems of the game are explained in the DMG, but apparently the designers just assumed for everything else, players would naturally and easily notice the many similarities across different cases and so the rules would become second nature.<br/><br/>I think I also recall reading something somewhere that the designers of 3e assumed that they were writing <i>the</i> definitive D&amp;D, in the sense that people would still be playing that system (with iterative small improvements and clarifications) in ten or fifteen years, more like how it had played out for AD&amp;D.  So they expected that, sure, it would take people a few years to really master the rules, but over time the logic of it would win out and it would be easy.<br/><br/>Of course, that isn't at all what happened.  Instead there was 3.5 (which Monte Cook was upset about, if I recall, because he thought it changed the game too much!), and then a few years later you had Rules Compendium, a supposed guide to the rules that is in fact full of essays about how the rules are hard to understand and you should ignore them.<br/><br/>So in fact I think they changed the rules and hired new people so much that even the people at Wizards of the Coast soon no longer understood the underlying logic.                        </div>

                            5e certainly looks back to 3e in many ways, but attempts to (with the exception of choosing spells, of course, because that's the sacred bugaboo for bad D&amp;D players) simplify the character creation/optimization process. I wouldn't classify it as a reformation game because as the OP puts it, it's a <i>historical classification</i> of a particularized trend. It's not that there weren't streamlined games before that (GURPS Lite was 1998) or after that (5e) but that it is a term that describes a historical trend in aesthetics.                        </div>

                            That 3E discussion is fascinating!! Thanks, <a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">@Vivificient</a> !!<br/><br/>Paul, when I say 5E has great underlying math, I'm not just talking about combat, though that too. It's really almost everything.<br/><br/>Despite what some stupid haters say, <i>they got caster / non-caster balance right</i>. That's a remarkable design achievement. See, when people talk about 3E's math not working, it's not just about combat being clunky and inelegant, or swingy, or whatever. It's also the fact that even relatively light optimizing meant just not playing about half the classes. Because Druids and Clerics were better at fighting than Fighters, Wizards could generally solve non-combat challenges more easily than Rogues, etc.*<br/><br/>Heck, even relatively light optimizing often meant bizarre feat chains, multiclassing, including into Prestige Classes, etc.<br/><br/>5E also got multiclassing and feats right, btw. They're optional extra complexity that literally no one needs to deal with who doesn't want to. You can even have half the people at the table using both of those subsystems, and the other half ignoring them, and it makes no difference to game balance. (Generally speaking: if someone with low system knowledge starts tinkering with feats or, especially, multiclassing, the results can be bad.)<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*There's some interesting stuff I've seen elsewhere about why this wasn't caught in playtesting: the playtesters were, understandably, 2E veterans, and played 3E like it was an improved version of 2E. So the Cleric cast support spells, the Wizard cast damage spells, the Rogue did skill stuff and sneak attacked, etc. They didn't actually set out to push the system's limits, which was obviously a huge error.                        </div>

Reading sloppily I first thought you meant 3e here, and I died.<br/><br/>Then from heaven I checked carefully and saw that you meant 5e♥♥<br/><br/>Not sure how great the balance is wrt utility/exploration, moon druid especially seem very strong being able to do various animal shapes to explore/solve things, otoh my party seems to only rarely remember that they can do this                        </div>

This is not my experience. Certain feats provide an exceptional power boost, such as Great Weapon Master and Sharpshooter.                        </div>

                            Paul: yes, 4E's classes are exceptionally well-balanced, generally speaking. Within each category (Defender, Striker, Controller, and Leader), some are better than others; for example, Paladin is generally considered a little weaker than the other Defenders, I believe. But overall 4E works well in terms of that issue. I, personally, had no problem with the fact that the classes' power structures were the same / similar, but it was a major design change.<br/><br/>VSK: So, 5E min-maxing is interesting. Something like Great Weapon Master or Sharp Shooter or a two-level Warlock dip for Paladins can spike your damage, but the ability to do raw HP damage is just about the only thing that *can* be optimized in that way. I mean, it's also possible to optimize for other things, such as AC, or having a huge spread of skills, or having great saves. But you can't do all those things, and someone who doesn't consciously min-max will generally be a bit better-rounded than someone who does go into crazy shenanigans to up their DPR (Damage Per Round). Then, since 5E's math is so much flatter than 3E or 4E's, that well-roundedness will actually matter over time.                        </div>

Hi Paul, yes 4e is hands down the best balanced iteration of Dungeons &amp; Dragons --- both in terms of intra-PC balance as well as the reliability and accuracy of its encounter build rules.  However, something to keep in mind is that its design parameters are quite different than other versions.<br/><br/>4e strongly assumes team participation in its rules structures. In other versions of D&amp;D it can sometimes feel like you're a group of Lone Wolves that happen to be adventuring together whereas in 4e its more like you're an actual Team. Its the whole point of the explicit class roles, so everybody has something they are doing that is actively helping the team as a whole. Even the striker, the most Lone Wolf-ish of all the class roles isn't just Do Moar Damage but is about being able to target specific enemies that others might have trouble getting to and taking them out or disabling them.<br/><br/>This is also true in the interaction and exploration pillars of the game. 4e's main non-combat tool is the Skill Challenge, which again assumes that *everyone* is participating. Just because its a social situation doesn't mean you let the Bard do all the talking while the Fighter checks his Facebook or whatever. Even something like Rituals, which are nominally the domain of spellcasters (although non-casters can access them easily through a feat), involve input from all the players because a) ritual components cost gold and b) several rituals require group skill checks to pull off. <br/><br/>That's part of the reason many people asserted all the classes "play the same" in my opinion. Its because D&amp;D players are so used to making a character that utterly and totally dominates certain parts of the game while the others essentially sit back and twiddle their thumbs and/or cheer them on. 4e is designed with the intent that you need the other players to work with you during every single challenge or encounter you come across. So, when every class "plays the same" what is really meant is spellcasters no longer obviate entire encounters or challenges by pushing a button. <br/><br/>Trent<br/><br/> </div>

Thanks for standing up for 3E's honour! <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>3E is the D&amp;D I've played the most, and although I have a love-hate relationship with it, overall it's probably the one I enjoyed the most, and I feel this thread has been overstating just how complex it is, and how bad the math is. (Even though both are true.)<br/><br/>I've also been running and playing 3E (I include Pathfinder here) more or less since it came out, so also happy to answer questions for comparison, especially if people are interested in how things work in play (for my group, at least) as opposed to what the letter of the rules says; the letter of the rules is easily available online, but with a game as complex as 3E, practice is usually significantly different.                        </div>

4E largely expects you to model utility/exploration scenes as skill challenges, or simple skill checks.<br/><br/>And in terms of skills, the classes are largely comparable. Some get a bit more or less, or some bonuses, but it's all in the same ballpark, and that's mostly it. There's little there of D&amp;D's classic "this guy needs to roll a swim check and get a 10 on the d20, this guy can turn into a fish, and this guy can teleport across the lake".<br/><br/>So compared to all other D&amp;Ds, it's very well balanced, but can feel rather bland if you enjoy using the widgets available in other D&amp;Ds.                        </div>

I think there's something interesting to note about 4E's balance: since it's so well balanced and transparent, the smaller imbalances are more grating.<br/><br/>In 4E you'll be offered a choice between 10 apples and 12 oranges. It is apples to oranges, but it can still make you feel you're missing out when you choose apples.<br/><br/>In 3E, it's more like 10 apples or a phone. Obviously the phone is more useful and valuable, but it's so different that it's more difficult to see it as a superior substitute good.                        </div>

Its like I said in my last post: 4e models non-combat challenges as Skill Challenges (for the most part) and assumes everyone is working together *as a team* the vast majority of the time. In other games, you might have one player cast a spell or make a skill check but in 4e everyone gets their hands dirty, both in and out of combat.<br/><br/>I would quibble that as the edition matured a lot more non-combat widgets started popping up --- more robust rituals as well as skill powers and martial practices --- and that the widgets that exist in other D&amp;D games are basically only the province of certain character types (spellcasters, basically). Which circles back to what I said upthread: when people say the classes all feel the same, what they *really mean* is the wizard can't circumvent an entire challenge by snapping his or her fingers in 4e. The fighter and rogue never had any of the widgets we're talking about (and mostly still don't, unless you're an eldritch knight or shadowdancer or something).<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

I mostly lost interest in 4E by then, but I was counting on someone better informed about that period mentioning this.<br/><br/>There's also an approach that I've never actually tried myself but now seems attractive to me: try to recontextualise your grid combat action powers into the non-combat situation at hand. If I can draw my enemies to me to cut them down en masse (ever-popular <a href="https://dnd4.fandom.com/wiki/Come_and_Get_It" rel="nofollow">Come And Get It</a>), I want to use that instead of making a skill check to draw the crowd's attention for an inspiring speech. If I can <a href="https://dnd4.fandom.com/wiki/Stand_tough" rel="nofollow">fortify allies with a few words of encouragement</a>, I want to use that instead of making a skill check push on a little further through the blizzard.

Absolutely no argument there.

However, when I say the classes feel the same (and I mostly don't: my first impression on reading was that they read the same, but I distinctly remember the first impression on reading is "wow, they play surprisingly differently, despite reading the same!") I mostly mean the apples to oranges thing I mentioned above.                        </div>

I felt it a lot more in 4E.<br/><br/>5E obfuscates just about enough, with the classes getting a different number of attacks, different refresh frequencies, differently reliable ways of boosting attacks... in 4E everyone gets 1 at-will, 1 encounter, 1 daily, and it's a lot easier to compare (what seems like) like for like.                        </div>

                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/shimrod">@shimrod</a> , just to be clear I wasn't suggesting *you* thought the classes were too similar. It was more of a general observation of the cultural response to 4e, which I strongly feel is rooted in the fact that certain character types (spellcasters) couldn't casually disregard entire obstacles in that edition. <br/><br/>Like you, I actually think that whole argument about too similar classes was silly. Classes that have traditionally played somewhat similarly, such as say the Barbarian and Fighter, play far more differently in 4e than in any other version of the game. Individual powers read similarly, yes, but the way those powers interact to create emergent play is very diverse and novel.<br/><br/>Using combat powers in lieu of, or in addition to, skill checks during a Skill Challenge is actually something touched upon in the DMG2's chapter on Skill Challenges. Sadly, as with most official advice on Skill Challenges, it did not go into near enough detail but the foundation was laid down to draw upon. I saw quite a bit of that kind of stuff within the 4e online community as well, such as the now defunct At-Will blog which had a whole series on the topic.<br/><br/>I agree with you on the apples and oranges comparison.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> , sure but if we're really being honest here its not about whether the Treadmill Effect exists or not, but how transparent and unambiguous the game is about its mathematical assumptions. Most D&amp;D style games make you jump through hoops to figure its math out (what <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> referred to as "spreadsheet hell" on another thread), even the 5e designers deliberately gave players the wrong math on purpose (the correct math is on the Blog of Holding among other places) for the purpose of obfuscating and misdirecting them on this issue. Its not like in Gygax's D&amp;D you'd see AC 9 dragons or AC 2 goblins running around: a monster's AC was pretty clearly a function of its Hit Dice. Also remember that for all the marketing hype surrounding "bounded accuracy", 5e's math is almost exactly 4e's math divided by 2 (except for skills where its more like 4e's math divided by 1.5) <br/><br/>What differentiates 4e here is not the existence of the treadmill, but the existence of clear and unambiguous advice and guidelines for the Dungeon Master as well as making the mathematical structure of the game as transparent as possible. For some players, of course, that's a bridge too far: they prefer not to see the man behind the curtain and keep the illusion of "progress" alive and well.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> ah ok, I see it now. So, I'd like to amend my previous statement. I didn't want to get into all of the details but when you compare the two editions:<br/>- Attack Bonus: 4e's 1x vs 5e's 1/2x = 4e math divided by 2<br/>- Armor Class: 4e's 1x vs 5e's 1/3x = 4e math divided by 3<br/>- Save DCs (equivalent to 4e's NADs): 4e's 1x vs 5e's 1/2x = 4e math divided by 2<br/>- Skill DCs (don't directly compare but a DC 10 for low-levels vs a DC 20 for high-levels is more or less reasonable): 4e's 2/3x vs 5e's 1/2x = 4e math divided by 1.3, approximately<br/>- Hit Point Growth: 4e's 8x vs 5e's 15x = 4e's math times 1.9, approximately<br/>- Damage Growth: 4e's 1x vs 5e's 3x = 4e's math times 3<br/><br/>There's still a Treadmill Effect here, the tracks are just moving at about 1/3 to 1/2 the speed of 4e's tracks, depending on what we're comparing. Unless we're talking about skills in which there's barely any difference between the two systems (seriously, you could port 4e's Level 1-20 DCs in 5e and you'd barely notice a change). The notable exception is hit point/damage growth, which progresses at a much faster rate than 4e's.<br/><br/>Trent                         </div>

I don't really know or care what a Treadmill Effect is but what I do know is that 5e is set up to be more sandboxy, more "go anywhere", more "do anything". A bunch of peasants can have an uprising against an evil level PC queen and still have a chance to hit her because of the bounded accuracy. It's just a fundamentally different way to play compared to how many 4e campaigns are set up.                        </div>

                            I think the 8x/15x HP might be the ration of HP at max level to 1st level? In 4e, starting characters get a whole pile of bonus HP, reducing that ratio by a lot.<br/><br/>5e puts most of its scaling into damage and HP, while 4e puts comparatively more of its scaling into bonuses and target numbers on the d20 roll.<br/><br/>That difference is what allows 5e characters to meaningfully interact with the same monsters, traps, and skill DCs over the course of the entire campaign.<br/><br/>In 4e, things you could interact with at level 1 are typically auto-hits (and completely incapable of hitting you without a nat20) or auto-passes by level 15 or so, and anything addressable by a high Paragon-tier character is completely unhittable or unpassable to a starting character.<br/><br/>In 5e, the enemies you were fighting at 1st level are still landing a hit on you at high levels; just maybe about half as often, and when they hit, they're whittling away maybe a 20th of your hit point total instead of 50%.<br/><br/>In 4e, the enemies you were fighting at 1st level are hitting you only on a natural 20, and whittling away a 20th of your hit point total instead of 25%.<br/><br/>(I've got none of the books for either edition in front of me, so please excuse illustrative rather than accurate arithmetic.)                        </div>

                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> , I was basing my comparisons on both editions' monster math. A typical CR 1/4 to CR 1 has about a +3 or +4 to hit and about AC 12 to 14. A typical CR 20 has about +13 to +15 to hit and about 19 to 21 AC. That maps up pretty close with 1/2x and 1/3x respectively.<br/><br/>In regards to skills, I was referring to the range of skill DCs 5 to 30. That is exactly the same range of DCs you would see in a Level 1 to 20 4e campaign (assuming Essentials math here). You could use either game's DC numbers in that level range, although it gets a little wonky with Skill Challenges and XP values.<br/><br/>I agree with you that campaign play is set up somewhat differently. Many 4e DMs would represent creatures with different statblocks depending on the context in which they are experienced. An angry peasant encountered at 1st level might be met as a part of a group of minions at 9th level and might even be encountered as part of a swarm in the paragon tier. The game doesn't flat out tell you to do this however (although the XP values neatly double every 4 levels so it suggests certain ways of representing the same creatures through different contexts) and many DMs would just keep the peasant as a 1st level standard monster.<br/><br/>I have actually experimented with decoupling level from tier in my home game (we're still in Heroic so haven't had to do it yet). Basically, once you hit Paragon tier instead of being "11th level" you become "Paragon 1st level" and your level-based bonus would reset back to +1. So the PCs' attack bonuses would always sit between +5 to +15, for example. Although this one is still a work in progress.<br/><br/>Trent                         </div>

<blockquote>A top level 5e character in their area of expertise has a +11 bonus (+6 proficiency, +5 ability of 20) on that DC 30 check, failing on any roll but 19 or 20.</blockquote>
Nitpick: If they have <i>expertise</i> (see, the keyword) in the skill, then they have a +17 (+6 proficiency doubled to +12, +5 ability).  So that's a 40% success rate.<br/><br/>Most characters don't have the expertise ability, so normally it is what you said.                        </div>

                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> , sorry that I was unclear before. I was referring to monster hit point growth in my 8x vs 15x comparison. In 4e, most monsters gain +8 hp and +1 damage per level. In 5e, monsters tend to gain about +15 hp and +3 damage per CR. If we're comparing player characters it really depends on their Constitution scores, but most PCs gain +5 hp per level in 4e vs +6 to +8 hp per level in 5e.<br/><br/>Your other points are well taken.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

                            4e has an easy quick &amp; fun encounter building algo. 5e doesn't really have encounters at all… when we were playing 1e (via Lab Lord AEC, I was kinda late to the D&amp;D party) we were guerilla killing skeletons with tripwires &amp; glue &amp; Color Spray. 5e is kinda similar. My party was fearing monsters into a corner and putting up walls of fire &amp; then killing them.<br/><br/>It's just a very different kind of game. Of course there are math similarities to 4e. Why should they throw that out? But there are also math differences. Such as the boundedly accurate peasant revolution                        </div>

                            5e does have encounter building rules, doesn't it?  They're on that page of the DMG opposite the picture of the giant ice cliff, if I recall.

I think 5e is intended to support either a guerilla warfare sandbox style, or a setpiece encounter style more like 4e.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people do play 5e with balanced setpiece encounters.  Evidence: there's a website called Kobold Fight Club that automates the encounter building rules, and I have seen a lot of people online recommending it and talking about using it.                        </div>

Yes, I was tryna tell <a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">@Trent_W</a> that the ones in 5e suck (they're on DMG p 81, the ice cliff is on the next spread over, p83; there are two alternative systems in XGE pp 88–91) while the ones in 4e are easy &amp; work consistently from level to level. The way monsters work in 5e it's pretty much impossible to do what you could do in 4e, encounter chains.<br/>Like, what CR <i>should</i> an intellect devourer be? A level 2 party <i>could</i> handle one. I know that from experience because the third group of level twos that my party threw at one managed to survive long enough to kill it, after two groups being TPKd by it… <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> Talk about glass cannon monster. Or maybe not so glass cannon, it having 6hd and resistance to normal damage. But it's still listed as a CR 2 450 XP creature. Which… might be correct? The CR 3 Owlbear has also killed a lot of my PCs; it has seven hit dice and a beak+claw routine at… plus… seven!!! If both connect, the beak is a 10-damage and the claw is a 12-damage. (I.e. a damage that costs 10 or 12 to negate respectively.)

Here, you are wrong. I play WotC modules. I've ran Lost Mine of Phandelver and Curse of Strahd, and we're just about to do sesh 64 of Tomb of Annihilation later today.<br/>The are not encounter chains. You can walk right up to Strahd right away in CoS. The castle is right there on the hill. You would <i>die</i>… but… you <i>could</i>. Our first batch of hobos skipped the haunted house in starting village and were killed by 3d6 wolves on a random forest encounter on their way to the castle. Our second batch died in the house. SMH. But we stuck with it and they ev explored the whole country &amp; defeated Strahd. They did the "evil place where Strahd actually got his powers" much dangerouser thing than Strahd's own castle (the famous Ravenloft castle that inspired the Castlevania video games that I love♥♥♥) before they went to Ravenloft so they did a more difficulter thing first. Because it's not a chain.<br/><br/>In our playthrough of Lost Mine of Phandelver, they saw the entrance to the "level 1 cave" and they were like "FUCK THAT! That looks dangerous! Let's get out of here" and then they got out of there and went to the level 3 place instead where they died.<br/><br/>We've also done B4 The Lost City and B2 Keep on the Borderlands. They are set up similar to the three modules I just mentioned. It's not encounter chains. It's just a completely different mode of play.<br/><br/>(We've also done a homebrew campaign [Glitchworld], a 3rd party campaign [Deep Carbon Observatory], and a 2e module [Corsairs of the Great Sea] where I took all the NPCs and locations from the railroad and relied more heavily on the setting books [I was lucky to snag all the al-Qadim stuff off an action site just after getting into 5e and just before D&amp;D blew up] and threw the railroad out to make it a sandbox. Inverted the maguffin so that the PCs were on the "enemy's" side. I also moved the Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan from Greyhawk to instead be nearby. We also started the Princes of the Apocalypse but abandoned it! I <i>love</i> the themes and NPCs but the book was sooo confusingly organized. Also it's more of a funnel; at the start of the campaign you can go to a bunch of different locations and sites and mini-dungeons etc but then as you dig yourself deeper you'll end up at the same place; that's not really my thing.)                        </div>
