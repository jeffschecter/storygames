If that's the case, and costs demand the game be a single book, then I will design it very differently.<br/><br/>I figured that the logical next step, before I start designing in earnest, would be to get price quotes.  My first thought was that I'd look up a few local printers, go into their stores, chat with them about my options, get a variety of quotes, and assess my options from there.  However, over the last few hours of research, it's become clear to me that doing that would only give me a tiny and rather arbitrary sample of my options.  A fuller list of the potential options includes:<br/>- 2 options that are within 10 minutes' drive (Chapel Hill)<br/>- 4 options 15-20 minutes away (Durham)<br/>- 12 options 35-50 minutes away (Raleigh, Garner, Holly Springs)<br/>- Lulu, who I've heard has good prices for black and white printing<br/>- Lightning Source, who I've heard has good prices for color printing<br/>- other printers in the U.S. and abroad<br/><br/>What I'd really like is a cost breakdown for all the pieces of the process of getting the game into people's hands, so I can decide which ones to just do myself.  Most of these steps are covered by at least a few of the printers I've looked at.  These steps include:<br/>- box vs shrink wrap vs book vs other<br/>- comic book size vs letter size<br/>- character sheets: loose vs tear-off<br/>- 2 pamphlets + 1 book vs 1 pamphlet + 1 book, etc.<br/>- assembling the various components of the game into one package<br/>- warehousing<br/>- order processing<br/>- fulfillment<br/><br/>Submitting 20 questions to 20 "Get a Quote" forms on 20 websites seems like it will take a lot of time and result in a lot of confused/frustrated printers.  So, while I'm pondering my options, I thought I'd see if anyone here has any suggestions.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-David<br/><br/>P.S.  Yeah, I know, I could just make it how I want to make it and then charge a price to match the costs... but I don't want to do that.  It's a small, simple game and I don't want to have to charge people 35 bucks for it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398700/#Comment_398700" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T23:40:16+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 11:40PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What exactly would you like to print, and in how large print runs? We might be able to simply tell you the whereabouts of what your plan will likely cost. After all, we live in a global economy, so the prices around the world do have some relationship to each other.<br/><br/>My experience doing similar things has been that first you need to get ballpark understanding of the rough expense of each type of component. Then this estimate will aid you in deciding on your exact format. Once you have that, you can do a proper quotation process where you contact many printers with your needs and compare prices.<br/><br/>As for how to get that rough price sense, asking printers is definitely a basic method. I would love it if we had efficient and up to date Internet resources that'd tell people how much say a 100 sets of dice would cost them on average, but unfortunately this is not the case, so you're stuck roaming the net, asking people with current information and requesting printers for price information.<br/><br/>Note that you're not interested in the cheapest possible way to get something done when you're developing your pricing sense; rather, you'll want to find out the most credible numbers, the ones that are clearly doable for reliable operators. This is because you'll be using this rough sense of pricing in making your initial plans, and therefore you need this information to be conservative. If you later find out that hey, I can actually get this done 50% cheaper than I thought, then good for you; such opportunities come up now and then if you happen to ask the right printer at the right time, but you shouldn't rely on that to make your plan affordable.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398703/#Comment_398703" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T00:11:33+00:00" title="November 26, 2012 12:11AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2012 12:17AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the offer to help me estimate component prices, Eero!<br/><br/><b>My ideal version of the game looks like this:</b><br/><br/>2 17"x11" color instruction sheets folded into 8.5"x11" pages, with printing on all 4 pages of each sheet (durable material -- oaktag?)<br/><br/>1 40-page color 8.5"x11" sticky tear-off pad of character sheets (regular paper)<br/><br/>1 40-page color 6 \u215d" x 10 \xbc" comic book, perfect-bound (regular paper)<br/><br/>1 color box (top and bottom) just large enough to hold the above (8.75"x11.25"x0.25"?)

The good part is that it's feasible to do some things by hand, while the bad is that some things have pretty expensive set-up costs. Of course the Kickstarter thing makes excessive handicrafts unfeasible as well, unless you're willing to limit the crowdfunding to a limited number of copies.<br/><br/>Generally speaking there's no reason to assume that there would be price jumps at specific print runs when we consider the field of print industry as a whole. Some specific printer might give you a price break at 100 copies, while some other one might give you one at 80, while yet a third will just quote you the set-up cost and per unit cost and let you do your own math. (This last one is obviously the most exact and transparent.) The general fact is that the per-unit cost will decrease with a larger print run, but that's about as much as can be said without looking at a specific printer's policy.<br/><br/>The first thing you should do is to ask Guild of Blades to run the numbers for you. They specialize on these sorts of small press boxed games in many ways, and publish their own as well as doing occasional printing for others. Most significantly, their operation is technologically grass-roots, so they've figured out the cheap and dirty ways of getting acceptable levels of quality in stuff like card printing, boxes and so on. They'll be able to suggest ways to improve your component layout, too, to drop the overly expensive pieces and put in affordable extras.<br/><br/>As for price estimates... the following is off the top of my head, and you would probably get similar or better numbers by just googling for random data points. Still, perhaps it'll help you decide where to focus your attention.<br/><br/><b>Dice:</b> ordinary d6 with pips are very cheap, as they're used so much in the mainstream. If you don't care about the appearance you might be able to score an unwanted brick or twelve at rather low prices. Won't cost more than some cents per die, anyway. Five cents per, that sort of price range.<br/><br/><b>Beads:</b> should be even cheaper than the dice, although depends heavily on the details - gardening beads, color-coordinated handicrafts beads, so on.<br/><br/><b>Pencils:</b> again, common mainstream stuff that doesn't need to be separately produced, so not very expensive.<br/><br/><b>Component bags:</b> these can be scored off mainstream sources, but there are also boardgame component manufacturers and shops for small press boardgame publishers that know exactly what you need and offer that. I would expect a cheap bag to cost e.g. 40c, but this'll have great variation based on the details.<br/><br/><b>Box:</b> this is the big one. I would go in expecting an unit cost of $5 and up, depending on details such as printing and finish and so on. Even more if you want top-shelf quality on such a short print run; I wouldn't even assume that I'd find a digital printer that was prepared to make the sort of boxes that are usually used for boardgames. You can get clever on this by e.g. producing custom-printed mailing boxes like Jim Raggi did for LotFP - this would again be a mainstream product, and thus cheaper than a proper game box. Or you could print your box art on the wrapping plastic like somebody did, enabling you to use pure white boxes - I think it was the aforementioned GoB, or might have been Chris Engle. Or use a VHS cassette case like I did with <i>Zombie Cinema</i> <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><b>Printed materials:</b> the main book would go for several bucks a piece, being full-color in a small print run, and perfect-bound. $5, for example. This can go down sharply with staples, 1-color printing and print run, of course. The instruction sheets would go for something like $1-$2 a piece, maybe? I don't have an off-hand sense for how much tear-pad binding costs, but it's probably not significantly more expensive than other glue bindings, so I'd expect the full-color character sheet pad to go for a few bucks as well.<br/><br/>I'll repeat that these numbers are out of my ass, you'll find that I'm off several hundred percent on several of those. But if you're completely clueless about what you can afford, having even a rough magnitude for the expenses could be useful.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say that the other components in your plan are pretty doable for a small press endeavour, but you'll need to figure out your own clever shortcut for the box, and maybe make the main book and character sheets 1-color. Then again, printing costs vary, so I expect that you could go under every one of my printing cost estimates once you look for the actually cheapest provider for each component.<br/><br/>Also, now that I'm doing numbers: getting your packed game boxes wrapped in plastic would cost something in the range of 20-40 c in Helsinki, probably not very different where you are. It's probably most feasible for you to get your components from separate suppliers (each from the cheapest one, basically), do the collation yourself and then take them out to have them shrink-wrapped by somebody who owns the appropriate machine. After that it's off to IPR or whoever you're thinking of for fulfillment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398716/#Comment_398716" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T04:46:30+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  4:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2012 4:50AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless you are committed to printing locally for ethical or social reasons, the physical location of your printer does not matter. Keeping it domestic for jobs of this scale makes sense usually (BPG has never printed overseas, for example, but Burning Wheel has). Lulu is not a cheap option, but it is an easy one. Even if you hire a short-run printer to do cheap books, you can still throw it up on Lulu.<br/><br/>Your multi-component job will be complex to source and I would strongly advise you to reconsider. Printing a perfect-bound book is hard enough. If you do decide to go with a box and a bunch of stuff, if you are making 100 of them just source each bit and then assemble them yourself. <br/><br/>Here's what I would do:<br/><br/>Print the book/comic. Include physical versions of whatever is on the pad. Lose the color. Lose the set-up box.<br/><br/>Your 11x17" instruction sheets become a set of 8.5x11" printouts in a free PDF.<br/>The padded material becomes another free PDF.<br/>Beads, dice, pencils?

The former will often be a [small package | light packet | light package], while the latter will be a dreaded <b>package</b>. In Canada, the flip point is whether it fits through a 2cm mail slot on a plastic ruler. (a helpful article <a href="http://littlebearsmom-canada.blogspot.ca/2011/10/packing-small-items-to-beat-canada.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) In the US, ounce weights increase shipping costs for boxes (and the beautiful "media mail" designation tops at 4lbs). These tipping points are significant. Shipping a light package in Canada costs me like $2.87. Shipping a package that's slightly heavier but exceeds the 2cm slot test costs me like $16.57. (and so next time I'll be shipping games individually to people, if they order two at once.)<br/><br/>If you want to do a set instead of a book, ask yourself: how much value am I adding for the end user? Am I quintupling the value? (because chances are you're quintupling the end cost, once shipping is factored in.)<br/><br/>Then ask yourself: how can I avoid dropping $2-7 per unit on boxes alone?<br/><br/>Tony Dowler did something novel with <a href="http://vulcanstev.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/how-to-host-a-dungeon-a-review/" rel="nofollow">How To Host A Dungeon</a>'s form factor.<br/><br/>I just indiegogo'd a game that features both a "book + cards" version and a "deluxe bagged set" version.

When you're designing for that format, you go big and glossy to attract the eye. And you include a super complete set because your target audience is a grandma buying for a 12 year old grandson, and "everything you need to play" is a selling point for such rubes.<br/><br/>But your stated target audience is in the 50-500 people range. That's core gamers. Folks who already have plenty of d6s around. Folks who have 20 other game books on their shelves, most of which they've never played. And in that print range, you're talking about primarily direct sales rather than shelf sales.<br/><br/>As one of those core gamer folks, if I were buying a print version of your game, I'd be doing so primarily because the idea of buying a superhero RPG that was printed in the format of a comic book amused me. I'd be buying it primarily to read it, and maybe play it eventually maybe maybe.<br/><br/>If I had to pay 50%+ extra to read it once and put the game on my shelf just because it came boxed with dice and tokens and pencils, I'd be right out, unless I was super amazingly enthused about your core product and convinced I would get tons of use out of it.<br/><br/>Given current trends, I'd suggest pricing each of the bits out separately and make them separate rewards levels in a Kickstarter. Then you can let the audience decide whether they want to pay for the extras.<br/><br/>And I'd suggest looking carefully at what the extras are. They're only really extra if they're extra.<br/><br/>For example, in Joe's case with The Quiet Year, I think it made a world of difference that the contempt tokens he was offering were charming little red skulls, rather than simple glass tokens. And as a fortunate complement to his design, a very simple drawstring bag actually added value while adding little cost.<br/><br/>So if you want to include dice and tokens, see if you can find clever ones that add value. Maybe scope out having custom dice printed. Or look at existing custom dice designs and find one that's a good fit.<br/><br/>If you want to include pencils, have them custom logo printed with Evil Deeds Inc. or something like that.

That may mean that, if you really want to go this route, you'll be pioneering a format that looks pretty different than what people think of as boxed sets. There has been some of this already, from Tony's transparent folder packaging for How to Host a Dungeon to Eero's video box packaging for Zombie Cinema to Joe's DVD case for Ribbon Drive to Ben's recent boxed version of Animal Crime. I've got a couple irons in this fire too, such as upcoming plans to print Metrofinal as a bunch of inserts stuffed into a cardboard record sleeve. <br/><br/>To make this work on the standard indie scale (i.e. hundreds of copies, rather than thousands), you really have to do something different and I think these products work better if you embrace that difference and make it a stand-out feature rather than trying to do the exact same thing as bigger publishers, just on a smaller budget. You end up either having to pass that cost onto your customers (which can be fine; if you want to sell $60-$150 limited edition sets, go for it!) or eating most of it yourself (which is also fine, but unsustainable in larger numbers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398755/#Comment_398755" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T12:32:38+00:00" title="November 26, 2012 12:32PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Joe's DVD case for Ribbon Drive</blockquote>\nWhich made Ribbon Drive a headache and a money-losing endeavor, for the record.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398756/#Comment_398756" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T12:33:56+00:00" title="November 26, 2012 12:33PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Italian edition of Montsegur 1244 comes in a repurposed corrugated cardboard cosmetics gift box.

It will be more expensive or take more of your time than single book. <br/><br/>2) Artsy and stylish is perfectly suited for a Kickstarter project, where people will more willingly buy into your vision. You can also scale what you do and how many copies you print based on interest.<br/><br/>3) Retailers often tell us that a boxed set will sell better than a book on a shelf, particularly for a game designed to be played with non-gamers (kid- or family-friendly games, party games, etc.); Of course, if it doesn't all go in a box, it will be harder for them to stock than a lone book would be.<br/><br/>4) Putting this together yourself will be a mess, so don't do that unless you're really excited about doing it by hand. You might look into one of the sourcing outfits like Tim used for Ghost Pirates  (I think it was called InnerWorkings).

The game will not be thick, and could probably fit in some sort of folder or slipcase.  Many of the options mentioned thus far sound nifty (cosmetics gift box, whoa!), but I also can't see how they'd be cheaper than a cardboard box.  Does anybody know what to look for in terms of finding a cheap package option?  Are we looking for someone else's already-created surplus that can be bought for pennies and repurposed?<br/><br/>As for a general approach, I'm now wondering if I need two products for two audiences:<br/><br/>1) Cheap book for veteran RPG folks who don't mind downloading, printing and stapling some rules docs.  Probably the bulk of my audience, expecting maybe 100 copies needed.<br/><br/>2) Pricier packaged version for comic book fans and others who really demand "pick up and play" convenience and want a game to look like a game.  This audience could fail to materialize entirely, but ya never know, I'd like to be prepared for success just in case.  (And I will be making efforts to reach them.)<br/><br/>I'll check in with Tim about <i>Ghost Pirates</i>, Gil Hova about Boardgame Geek's resources for games like his <i>Prolix</i>, and Ryan at Guild of Blades, and report back what I find.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398784/#Comment_398784" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T17:07:12+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  5:07PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me add a suggestion to touch base with the people at OneBookShelf (DrivethruRPGs, etc.) about their print program.

Which can be combined?"<br/><br/>It looks like your rules sheet and character sheets could be included in the comic book which would mean you could get the whole basic product done in one go in a way that would not need a box. That would absolutely be the cheapest way to go. The players could provide their own dice, tokens, pencils and box. Economically all those little bits and especially the box is what will eat you up alive. The single book has the advantage that you can POD it in very small numbers and never do a large print run. Since your game is likely aimed at a very limited market it is important to not over print. <br/><br/>I've had some experience with hand processing set up boxes. Uline sells rigid set up boxes 11x8.5x2 but not thinner (thought they exist because we've all seen them holding stationary. You can get 11x8.5x1 inch boxes (heck I'd sell you mine - cheap! - I have a hundred I think) BUT they do not stand up on their own well. As to wrapping the boxes - that is most important thing for the sale. People need to see at as professional (which usually means shiny). If they think it was made in your garage, they don't value it. What I've found is that this means completely outsourcing the printing of the wrap. Right now I'm using smaller boxes but with the larger set up boxes I get 11x17 stickers printed and two bumper stickers. The bumper stickers go on the sides, the larger sticker gets trimmed down and can go on the box top and the top and bottom sides. You can do this yourself when the numbers are 200 or less. It is a pain and a lot of work but you can do it. <br/><br/>Just because you can do this does not mean that it is a good idea to do it. Your energy is in game design. Production will sap that energy away - I know this first hand. Avoid this if you can! The next hard piece is the selling. Personally I suck at this part which means I should never do this full time. Finding other people to sell - like Indie Press Revolution - is a good bet. Getting into stores is harder. Figuring this out has been one of my biggest tasks of the last ten years. <br/><br/>Ah... getting into stores...<br/><br/>It's the old black dragon Ron Edwards talked about ten years ago. It is not a fair game. Stores need stuff but small press stuff gets little attention. When they do order it (and distributors will) they do in very small numbers. My recent experience is 120 to 200 copies. Then if there is not momentum (and how could there be?) there are no reorders. If you get those 200 orders the profit is minimal so far I've personally not had a splash. It's just another place to push a few copies of the game. <br/><br/>By all means move forward. I've grown as a person from my publishing endeavors. Check in as you go and don't write any big checks before talking it over here. There is a lot of experience with the people who've commented on this thread. People who are a lot more successful than me. <br/><br/>Chris Engle/Hamster Press                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398887/#Comment_398887" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T12:41:24+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 12:41PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is <a href="http://boxsmart.shoppkg.com/shop/PR1-C490.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> the kind of box you're talking about, Chris?  $.46 each seems like a good price but I have no idea what it costs to pretty it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398895/#Comment_398895" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T13:58:51+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  1:58PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are the 2" set up boxes.

I'm weighing these against what I see as the benefits of that package.  My thinking on that might be unrealistic, but here's what I'm looking at right now:<br/><br/>I do not <i>expect</i> this game to sell many hundreds or thousands of copies.  I do not <i>expect</i> it to make a dent in my yearly income/expenses equation.  That said, I would like to explore what's possible on that front.  If I go to PAX and set up a table and some guy sees "supervillain game" and comes over to check it out, then:<br/><br/>1) If he decides not to buy it because he's not up for the creative demands or the social interaction or the character portrayal, I'm fine with that.  If he decides not to buy because he likes tactical games with more crunch, I'm fine with that.  If he decides not to buy because he wants his supervillainy to be pure badassery without the needy element of <i>Within My Clutches</i>, I'm fine with that.<br/><br/>2) If he decides not to buy because he looks at a bound book and says, "I have to read all that?", or "So where's the actual game?", or "I have to go online and download and print stuff?"... well, unless the economics render the bound book truly unavoidable, I'm <i>not</i> fine with that.  That's my mistake... because I know better... because I feel the same way!<br/><br/>I'm thinking that guy <i>would</i> buy a box with an instruction sheet and an advice comic and a bunch of ready-to-go characters, because it would be both true and obvious that "I could start playing right now!"  All those intermediate steps are removed and all that's staring you in the face is the fun.<br/><br/>Big deal?  Small deal?

Been there. It's possible to make a boxed set in small press with some ingenuity and purse-stretching, so if that's how you want to present your game, then by all means. I do agree with what's been said about it probably not being worth it for the established audiences, but if the hardcore is not who you want to talk to with your game, then what does that matter? I didn't make Zombie Cinema for the people who already grog Mountain Witch and Primetime Adventures, I made it for folks who've never played anything like it. The insider audience is just an afterthought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398975/#Comment_398975" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T06:01:50+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  6:01AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2012 6:17AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys.  Honestly, though, I <i>would</i> like to make as much money as I can off this game*.  Or, well, let me re-phrase slightly: I'd like to reach as many customers as possible with this game, as long as I can do that without costing myself a huge percentage of the money I'd otherwise make.  Chopping my profit per sale in half and reaching twice as many people would be great.  Chopping my profit per sale by 80% and reaching only 20% more people, on the other hand, would suck.<br/><br/>So, if you spot me making unnecessary sacrifices in terms of the number of people I could potentially reach, please let me know!  It certainly wouldn't be intentional.<br/><br/>I am assuming that certain avenues, like distribution, aren't realistic for a product without a pre-established customer base.  I mean, I don't see any reason why Alliance, for example, would want to take a gamble on the first RPG from an unknown creator.<br/><br/>*I honestly think my effort to make the game as user-friendly as possible is 100% compatible with that.  Customer satisfaction, positive buzz, word of mouth, all that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400075/#Comment_400075" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T04:21:30+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  4:21AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Boxes:</b> a friend of mine suggested Maker Spaces.

You've got a picture in mind of what things look like -- but finding the right actual parts requires aiming at a price point and then working backwards from there. Otherwise, you're likely to end up with a beautiful presentation that loses you money.<br/><br/>500 units might barely start hitting price breaks on certain components, but I wouldn't bet on it. For reference, the cost of producing 500 copies of Ghost Pirates was about $7.50/unit. Going by game industry rule of thumb for a produced game, that would mean it has to be priced at about $50. I didn't hit real price breaks until I got up to 2000+ units.<br/><br/>If you're going to do 500 copies or fewer, I'd probably try to arrange handling assembly myself and try to wrangle wholesale prices on components. You can probably manage to wrangle assembly with the goodwill of friends and the price of a few pizzas. That said, I recall Eppy swearing that off after Time &amp; Temp (YMMV).<br/><br/>You might consider tri-fold brochures and presentation folders (filed under "marketing materials") from on-demand printers and consider altering your instruction sheet's form factor. I have very much liked <a href="http://www.overnightprints.com" rel="nofollow">Overnight Prints</a>  quality for the price. <br/><br/>Depending on the size of your final package and your goals, 500 units of a single game isn't a _terrible_ amount to store by yourself. Estimate warehousing will cost $20/month per pallet (not that I think you'll have anywhere close to that much product at 500 units) and distro to cost $3-5/unit which does not include shipping.<br/><br/>What's your intended price point?<br/><br/>FYI: Gil doesn't publish himself. It's a headache that he doesn't want (totally fair).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405228/#Comment_405228" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T13:02:24+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  1:02PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2013 1:05PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, thanks for the input!  Good stuff.  I'll tell you what I've been thinking, and then maybe you can tell me which parts of it are insane.<br/><br/>Looking at the sales figures for self-published RPGs (much data from a discussion on lumpley.com a while back), it seems that there are a few basic tiers:<br/>- The 2 or 3 most successful folks selling several thousands of copies per year.<br/>- A few games that are extremely famous within the indie scene (but not at the above level) selling 500 or so copies in their first year and 1500 or so copies ever.<br/>- Plenty of games that make a splash on Story Games (or some other small community) when they debut but don't do much beyond that, and other such modest successes, selling 200-300 copies.<br/>- An infinite amount of games that never sell at all.<br/><br/>I am hoping that the quality of my game, the popularity of the subject, and the fact that I'm putting in some effort to show it will keep me out of the last category.  That seems realistic to me.  But getting up to the sales level of a game like Polaris or Shock, while I do <i>hope</i> for that, does not strike me as a <i>remotely</i> safe bet.  Accordingly, I was planning to order a first print run wherever the price per unit breaks between 50 and 250 copies.  Honestly, if the price per unit is only a little cheaper at 250 than at 100, going with 100 seems safer to me.<br/><br/>As for customer pricing, I was attempting to guess at what they'd pay.  For the book version, $20 is about what most small RPG softcover books cost, so I was figuring no higher than that.  For the boxed set, I'm torn between thinking board gamers and video gamers would pay $45 and roleplayers would pay $30.  Since the boxed set is more targeted for the former audience, perhaps the $45 is okay... on the other hand, I might lose the "might as well give it a shot, it's way cheaper than a video game!" impulse buys.  I dunno, I'll say $40 for now.<br/><br/>As for costs, that $50/$7.50 ratio sounds like a good thing to shoot for, but I'd probably still be turning a small profit with twice that, wouldn't I?  My impression is that, for $20 softcover RPG books anyway, paying half your price in cost means you about break even, 1/3 means you make a little profit, and 1/6 or 1/7 is as good as it gets.  So, my guess is that if I'm spending $13 per unit to produce a boxed game that sells for $40, I'm probably happy.<br/><br/>As for the softcover version, I was thinking $7 per unit would be acceptable, but $4.50 or so should be doable from my survey of what's out there.<br/><br/>Important note: I don't know how much Kickstarter changes the equation.  Every single number I quoted above might be different now.<br/><br/>Whaddaya think?<br/><br/>As for the instruction sheets, yeah, "presentation folder" is exactly the sort of thing I'd been hoping might work.  A tri-fold brochure is too small unless it's abnormally large -- my rules are too long, unfortunately, and I don't want to make readers squint.  Thanks for the tip on Overnight Prints!<br/><br/>As for warehousing and fulfillment, my current thinking is this:<br/>1) I'll check and see if any of my printing options offer those services cheaply<br/>2) I'll do some from home; my apartment has room for books, and this is cheapest<br/>3) I'll use some fulfillment houses like IPR for exposure -- in those cases, I'd hope to ship from the printer straight to the fulfillment house<br/>4) there are other options with distributors, but I can't imagine one of them picking up my first print run                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
