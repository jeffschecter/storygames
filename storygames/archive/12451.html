I've had lots of successful design come from play as a pure flow of events or as a sense of narrative momentum (which can have multiple 1-2 player "scenes" woven together). <br/><br/>Coming of Age, Homeworld Project, and Pure Shoujo, earlier versions <a href="http://wyrmwood.mmo-report.com/playtest/list.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> all have an aspect of that.  <br/><br/>Homeworld Project is a particularly interesting case as in further design it's been showing how much design room there is for the in game evolution of "being a player", "being a GM", and "having one or more GMs". As in a given person can play towards being the or one of the GMs with specific fictional consequences, while another person can play towards giving up her GM role in favor of a character she had created during the course of being the GM, again with specific fictional consequences.<br/><br/>In any case, Homeworld Project is also the game which goes into the most detail on this kind of narrative momentum approach, in its case called the Action. So even if you want to be a GMless purist, it may be worth a look for that at least.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skage" title="Skage"><img alt="Skage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skage">Skage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279648/#Comment_279648" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T07:20:42+00:00" title="July  8, 2010  7:20AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Polaris, while I was playing with my group, we didn't really have multiple protagonist on the screen at once, we had the scenes broken up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the suggestions thus far, these sound like great games to try out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279655/#Comment_279655" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T07:49:03+00:00" title="July  8, 2010  7:49AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's Grey Ranks, of course, perhaps the most mechanically beautiful GMless game.<br/><br/>Gun Thief involves all three players throughout, possibly playing anywhere from one to a lot of characters depending on the Law's disposition and the current Jagged Women situation.

But it's also quite possible to say "Jim, your knight is there in the scene with me, and I'm questioning you about what happened in the cavern" just as you would an NPC.  Each scene focuses on a given PC, but that doesn't mean that it has to exclude other protagonists.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Fiasco, each scene focuses on one PC.  But each PC is defined by their relationships to other PCs and by the needs/objects/locations they share with other PCs.  So you're subtly encouraged to include the other PCs that you are tied to: in my scene, I want to bring my relationship to your guy into play.
