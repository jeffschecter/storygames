For some reason today I was thinking about the potential possibilities of using Go as either an RPG task/conflict resolution system or to create structure for a story game.<br/>Here's my weird idea so far:<br/>I'm thinking something like Sons of Liberty, but much slower, and with only 2 people.<br/>Just like playing cards of particular suits in Sons of Liberty are meant to cue descriptions of certain kinds of actions, I'm thinking playing stones in different areas of the Go board would cue descriptions of various types of action.  If stones are captured from the play, some kind of aggressive action would be narrated, possibly filled in by the person who lost the stones.  The more lost, the greater the set-back in the narration.  Similarly, some placement is clearly aggressive or defensive, and that would guide the narration as well.<br/>And that's pretty much all I've got so far.<br/><br/>Clearly this isn't really a new game so much as it's Go with some story tacked on.  Or some freeform roleplay given structure by the flow of a game of Go.  I don't know how much sense this really makes or if it would be interesting to expand on... but it's been running through my head this morning, so I thought I'd throw it out here for public consumption and open myself to the commentary or ridicule of the masses.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148997/#Comment_148997" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T09:52:28+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  9:52AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fiddled with a chess-based oracular rpg system in 2005 for theoretical purposes, so I have some experience with this. The basic lesson is that you won't actually get an inspiring rpg out of it without having some way for the fiction to influence the boardgame underneath - my game was full of ways for the board to influence the fiction but nothing in the other direction, which basicly meant that it was just a storytelling oracle which the players considered heavy and tiring to use, as they needed to both play chess and tell a story, which was often rather disjointed itself. Because I wasn't interested in actually breaking Chess to make the game fun (my theoretical goal was to learn what happens when you don't have the fiction influence the mechanics except through player choice in tactics), I abandoned the project at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149001/#Comment_149001" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T09:56:13+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  9:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe you'd be better off approaching it from the other direction, building up a story that allows you to play Go while in character?

"The Master of Go" (which I have read) is an example. For a more modern take, you could use the anime Hikaru no Go as an example.<br/><br/>So you have rounds of storytelling punctuated by playing Go. What happens in the Go phase effects the resources you have to tell the story. Let's say a group of stones on the board that are under attack manage to live. Then we switch to our story game. The fact that your group lived affects the story that both you and I now tell.<br/><br/>Maybe you could build the story around elements relevant to the Go game. One example that springs to mind is the way that in Go you have to give something to get something. You can't win everywhere, so you choose where you want to win territory and where you're willing to lose territory.<br/><br/>That's pretty vague, but maybe it'll spark someone else to come up wtih a concrete mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149014/#Comment_149014" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T10:36:16+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 10:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The structure of the game would make it a really interesting challenge to determine seemingly simple things like "Is this stone an attack?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI play the 4-4 star point, you approach at the low knight's move, and I play <i>way the heck past you</i> at a high (fourth-rank) large knight's move past your stone.

I might even design such a game to work from already played transcripts of master play, so the players don't need to break out the board to play. Keep the relationship between the Go board and gameplay loose, too; essentially, use a Go transcript as a rpg scenario. I like, that has the same appeal as those old barcode battle electronic games did - take something mundane like a barcode, insert into the system, and voila, there's a battle-ready character there. Would just need some objective rules (as in, you and I would get roughly the same rpg scenario out of the same transcript) for turning the Go events into rpg play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Go variants, there are a bunch, of course. I agree that it's a shame to ruin the game's conceptual simplicity by adding all kinds of special pieces and such, though. Works better for Chess - I might go that way if I ever go back to that design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149022/#Comment_149022" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T11:04:50+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 11:04AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>The structure of the game would make it a really interesting challenge to determine seemingly simple things like "Is this stone an attack?"<br><br>I play the 4-4 star point, you approach at the low knight's move, and I play<em>way the heck past you</em>at a high (fourth-rank) large knight's move past your stone.

Whether or not something is an "attack" is determined by the attacker, isn't it?  If I do something to try to hurt you, then it's an attack.  It may not actually succeed in hurting you (in which case, it's a poor, failed attack) but it's still an attack.  Similarly, if I do something to try to protect myself, it's a defense, even if it doesn't actually help save me.<br>There's no reason to have a giant list of moves to look up to see whether it should be narrated as an attack or defense or something else.  Let the intentions of the players determine it.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149026/#Comment_149026" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T11:18:09+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 11:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the problems I've personally found in ideas like this (I've experimented with these kinds of things for a while, and have been meaning to write a thread about it) is the fact that you have to constantly be handling the board. All the time. It must not leave your awareness.<br><br/>So in games like, I dunno, let's say The Shadow of Yesterday or SOTC or In a Wicked Age.  You have your character sheet. Thing is, it's not all-pervasive. You can decide to put it down, not look at it for a while, and simply roleplay. You're not absolutely tied to the sheet or rolling the dice. You can leave them behind for a while, and then come back to them when you want to.<br/><br/>With games that have their central mechanic be based on an entire game of something else (I've tried with Mahjongg and Shogi), you can not step away from the board to roleplay for a while, and return. The gains, losses, or effects that the board has is so tied to the narrative that you simply can't leave it.  <br/><br/>It's fun for an experiement, but over time I found it in practice to be really tiring; not being able to leave the board/game when I want to, when a scene is flowing awesomely with simply roleplaying: We have to break what we're doing and return to the board to have it tell us what happens next, rather than simply roleplaying it out.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149028/#Comment_149028" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T11:49:28+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 11:49AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>the fact that you have to constantly be handling the board.

Though, I've only played it once so far, and I must admit I had some difficulties that I think were linked to this very situation.  It was hard for me to simultaneously think about what cards I could play and what I wanted to narrate into the "story" that was going on.  Still, I think it's something I could get used to.<br/>Of course, that's a fast-paced game of insanity.  Something designed around Go would be slower and more thoughtful.  Maybe this kind of split between board and narrative can work for something fast and not particularly serious, but not work so well for something serious?  I don't know...<br/><br/>Thoughts on the idea of "breaking the game" with changes to the rules:<br/>If you're really serious about wanting to play Go, you should just be playing Go.  As soon as you decide you want to play The Go RPG you've decided you're interested in something beyond or aside from the standard game of Go.  So I don't see it being a huge issue to add rules modifications.<br/>The simplest ones would be something akin to, again Sons of Liberty.  Each character could have a couple special strengths, things that when narrated into the story would allow him or her to do something different on the board.  Perhaps play two stones at once.  Perhaps move a stone that's already on the board, or recover stones that have already been captured (not to place them on the board, probably, just take back the points).<br/>And if both players know that one is a better Go player than the other, these abilities could be used instead of, or along with, standard Go handicapping.  The weaker player could be given more "special abilities" to even things, possibly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149031/#Comment_149031" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T12:07:50+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:07PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, what I meant by "breakIng" Go was to produce a game that was either<ol><li>Unwinnable with reasonable play by both sides; or</li>\n<li>Had an obvious winning strategy for one side.</li></ol>There are, as Eero points out, Go variants (you can find a bunch of them <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/go/variants.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), but most of them aren't the sort of thing that would work in this environment, being variants on the board or the number of players.

I think people think it has this flavor because it has a tremendously long history and culture attached to it.  Which is great.  I think it's really cool that there are all these traditions and everything that go with the game.<br/><br/>But teach the game to someone who's never heard of it before, who doesn't know anything about it's history, and I don't think that person will pick up on this "flavor."  The game is utterly and totally abstract.  It's black and white stones on a grid, for crying out loud!

Go makes a lot of assumptions about play that are baffling in comparison to games like chess and checkers (about the value of numbers, about surrounding vs. direct confrontation, about what makes a defense strong, about when the game is declared over, etc.).  I'm not talking about cultural assumptions so much (it's pretty different from other traditional Chinese board games as well) as assumptions about what makes for good strategy and creative play.  And if you're going to build on Go to create a roleplaying game, it makes sense to try to take those into account when imagining what play would be like.  or not, I guess, but that'd be how I'd do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149072/#Comment_149072" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T13:34:56+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  1:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's entirely possible that my lack of experience with Go is a major factor if the claims I'm making.<br>But I agree partially with what you two are saying.<br>I'm not sure I agree that a system like this COULDN'T be used for a two-fisted pulp game, but I think doing so would be bizarre.

If the board acts as a character sheet or a situation map, there's some interesting potential here. Either pre-defined board areas would represent situation elements or areas of interest could be created in play (or pre-play prep.) And then <i>ko</i> fights would be perfect for wide-ranging conflicts that can touch on or threaten anything on the situation map, Go-rp's version of Bringing Down the Pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this could work if the interplay between the boardgame and the fiction isn't on a move-by-move basis, but rather arises from the things you do in Go. E.g. ko fights as above, or abandoning a local fight to play away on another part of the board, but also sente/gote - both the making chains of moves that force a response and whether you end up retaining the initiative or not. Could initiative be one of the ways the fiction feeds back into the boardgame (other than determining where on the board the players focus) - a player could have the option to 'give' in the fiction at certain points, to gain the initiative or a free stone for positional purposes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
