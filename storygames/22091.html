Long time lurker, first-time poster...<br/><br/>I had a question about some comments on another thread and didn\u2019t want to derail it, so I\u2019m starting a new thread.<br/><br/>Here are some quotes from the  the \u201cTrad Reformation\u201d thread:<br/><br/><b><i>For me, the third option (OSR [and proto-OSR like the Knights of the Dinner Table] and Story Now games being the two other ones) has been neo-trad games a la Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark.</i></b><br/><br/>and<br/><br/><b><i>Although I think the \u201cneo-trad\u201d games (like Apocalypse World, Blades in the Dark, maybe FATE, and others) seem to be mostly derived from the story game tradition, curving back towards traditional play rather than the other way around. </i></b><br/><br/><br/>This something I\u2019ve seen said on this forum a few times, which is that games like Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark aren\u2019t \u201cStory Now\u201d games, but something more traditional (or Neo-traditional).<br/><br/>So I guess I don\u2019t understand what counts as \u201cStory Now\u201d. I\u2019ve read Ron Edwards essays, I\u2019ve lurked on forums, and from how I understand it, Story Now is a style/agenda/whatever in which:<br/><br/>A.) The main goal of play is to create an meaningful narrative that at least approaches what could be considered a \u201cgood story\u201d (i.e. Characters do something and are changed by the experience, there is some kind of premise addressed, and the structure at least of sort resembles a traditional story with rising action/climax/denouement, and there is a satisfying conclusion of some sort, with \u201cmeaningful\u201d, \u201cpremise\u201d and \u201csatisfying\u201d being highly subjective terms.)<br/><br/>B.) The story created is in no way prewritten or controlled by one member of the play group. Player decisions control where the story goes, and there is no foregone conclusion or expectations of moving towards a particular outcome. You \u201cPLAY TO FIND OUT\u201d. It is shared creation of the narrative that happens organically.<br/><br/>C.) Decisions made (in play and in design) prioritize story-creation (as described in A.) over the immersion in/exploration of the shared imaginary world (Simulationism/The Right to Dream) or the overcoming of challenges by the players (Gamism/Step On Up).<br/><br/>So when I run a PbtA game, for instance <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/271947/Tales-of-the-Obsidian-Idol" rel="nofollow">my own fantasy hack</a> (SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION!), I think it conforms to the above. The narrative is improvised on the spot, based on the characters\u2019 starting premisses and driven by their decisions, and the mechanics are designed around pushing the story forward (altering the narrative in one interesting/meaniful direction or the other) rather than \u201cbalance\u201d or \u201cverisimilitude\u201d. <br/><br/>I find this to be true of most PbtA games, Fate, and Blades in the Dark... or I think I do?<br/><br/>( I\u2019ve seen some criticism of Dungeon World on this front that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t do PbtA right\u201d, but in this case let\u2019s leave that for another discussion and take PbtA to mean games like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Masks - games I think most would agree \u201cget\u201d PbtA.)<br/><br/>So, what am I not seeing?<br/><br/>Am I wrong about what Story Now means?<br/><br/>If not, how do the games mentioned not qualify?<br/><br/>What games out there do qualify as Story Now? (And how are they different?)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483801/#Comment_483801" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T17:27:14+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  5:27PM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story Now, as originally constructed, means a game in which <i>the players </i>make a <i>moral statement </i>through play.

Or is it a function of the mechanics at all? Is it all in the subject matter the group chooses to explore and independent of mechanics?<br/><br/>Also, (and I realize I'm opening a gigantic can of worms) if there is a whole subset of games whose mechanics are generally aimed at the creation of story instead of providing challenge or simulating physics/genre conceits, (which would be Neo-Trad), and within that group of games some focus on addressing a moral premise, as opposed to the rest that address premises like "Can we save the princess? Who will control the throne? How the war affect the kingdom," etc. Then why is Story Now not just a subset of Neo-Trad games and instead it's own category?<br/><br/>It seems like (to make a music analogy) dividing popular music into Rap, Country, Pop, Rock, and Late 70's Prog Rock. One of those seems like it's obviously just a specific subset of another category? <br/><br/>Or is there something (besides the type of question being answered by the story) that sets Story Now further apart from other story-based games?<br/><br/>Or do I just not like these categories?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483807/#Comment_483807" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T18:10:54+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  6:10PM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It seems like (to make a music analogy) dividing popular music into Rap, Country, Pop, Rock, and Late 70's Prog Rock.

I have five such shelves available for records.<br/><br/>All the hip hop obv goes in one (Wu-Tang clan ain't nothing to mess around with! Dead Prez, Super Sa\xefan Crew etc), The second one is for country, First Aid Kit and of course my precious Emmylou collection and those American Recordings by Cash. The third one is for pop, sure, Bangles, Madonna\u2026 All the SAW stuff like Bananarama (A Linn my favorite drummer). Then I have two shelves left for rock. Need to put my Opeth and my Grateful Dead and my Ebba Gr\xf6n and my Crass and my Sisters of Mercy and my Wolves of the Throne Room in there. At first I just split the rock collection up in two halves; had it sorted alphabetically and A-O in one shelf and P-Z in the other.

There's <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134196/Chuubos-Marvelous-WishGranting-Engine" rel="nofollow">Chuubo's marvelous wish-granting engine</a> for example, where (correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't played the game) players decide how the story will evolve before playing a scene, so there are no surprise twists while players are roleplaying their characters. Instead they are trying to build up drama around the scene premise discussed until the twist appears in a more natural way. <br/><br/>The game also incentivizes players to introduce short scenes of their characters interacting with the world in simple but meaningful ways, to show characters change or growth. <br/><br/>This is so different from PbtA and so far from old trad games that it makes sense to call PbtA Neo-trad, yet Chuubo is still too close to roleplaying to not call it an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483809/#Comment_483809" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T18:33:40+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  6:33PM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The terminology itself is rather arbitrary. For the record, I would never call something like AW a "neo-trad" game myself, despite using the term in my own rpg history writing; I reserve that term for games that are fundamentally traditional while distinguishing themselves from earlier stages of the tradition by adopting minor ideas and influence from progressive design. Generally published by mid-size houses like FFG, Mongoose and such. AW is in cultural history terms a straightforwardly Forgite indie game in comparison. You might as well call <i>Sorcerer</i> a "neo-trad" game. The argument for AW being trad basically amounts to it having character classes and a GM, as far as I can see.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is rather clearly a narrativist game, which maybe makes it a "Story Now" game as well? As people enmeshed in the PbtA movement should know, the "PbtA" label in itself doesn't mean much, so there's no guarantee that any given game under that rubric is also "Story Now" or "narrativist", but for AW itself I don't see any controversy - insofar as rpg theory <i>even is a thing</i>, such that any analytical claims can be made, AW is as narrativist or Story Now as just about any game you'd care to name.<br/><br/>That said, Jason is of course right in saying that you don't have to play AW - or any other game - in a narrativist way. Games are only "Story Now" in the sense that they support and harmonize with the intent to play them in that way, not in a mandatory sense where it would be impossible to do something else with the game instead.<br/><br/>In general, though, I would suggest that juxtaposition between an analytical theory term like "Story Now" and a cultural history concept like "neo-trad" will probably only get confusing if you insist on treating them like somehow equivalent categories.<br/><br/>The fact that "Story Now" is something of a marketing label that Ron coined for his own narrativist game design doesn't help the confusion. You could understand is as strictly a synonym of "narrativism" in the Big Model sense, or you could understand it to mean "the particular kind of narrativist game that Ron Edwards makes", and I frankly don't know which way you should go. Is <i>Prince Valiant</i> a "Story Now" game?<br/><br/>In the end it's just a stupid terminology squabble.

To put it in philosophical terms: there are no Pure Forms, and objects are differentiated by exhibiting their own unique combinations of Qualia.  But further: that these qualia do not adhere to any particular scale, field, or schema among themselves.  Worse than comparing apples and oranges, this is more like comparing apples and flying.<br/><br/>Thus, the approach taken to the classification of complex systems should be more molecular than categorical.  There will always be multiple axes along which to parse these objects, many of which not be reliably mappable to the qualia of other objects in the sample.  The resulting taxonomy will resemble a multi-dimensional collection of "tags" (which themselves will exhibit a lot of gapping and overlapping along different dimensions), and will still fail to define a universal and contiguous spectrum.<br/><br/>And from a creative standpoint, that's good news.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483818/#Comment_483818" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T19:27:01+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  7:27PM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf%E2%80%A6">@AsIf\u2026</a><br/>Joe says "What they forgot to kill went on to <i><b>organize</b></i>!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483819/#Comment_483819" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T19:33:47+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  7:33PM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Putting AW and Lady Blackbird in with jeep games and Danish larps is just a big whiskey tango foxtrot in my book</p></div></blockquote>\nThree seconds later she remembered that her own revelatory, <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/riss" rel="nofollow">official and canonical RISS model</a> sorted all that stuff into the same sorry corner</div></blockquote>\nOn second thought I think those jeep games and Danish larps and Montsegur or Fiasco style games have several things in common with the Rails corner even though there's no DM.

The main distinction between the RGFA Threefold and the Forge's Creative Agenda (i.e., GNS) is that where the Threefold imagined Gamism, Dramatism, and Simulationism to be describing priorities for individual decision-making at given moments of play, the Big Model strictly speaking saw GNS as serving as a communal (group level) orientation to the game over longer arcs of play or "reward cycles." So an orientation toward Story Now didn't mean that individuals made decisions based on what was "good for the story"; rather, it meant what generated the most payoff or satisfaction for the group as a group was the sense that the arc of play as a whole was <i>meaningful</i>--versus faithful to its source (Right to Dream), versus challenging to its players (Step On Up). A group's Creative Agenda doesn't have to be all-encompassing; it just has to emerge as an overarching orientation toward the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483832/#Comment_483832" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T21:27:46+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  9:27PM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" rel="nofollow">AlexanderWhite</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Put another way, me and my character can disagree about what their best interests are.</p></div></blockquote>\nCould or shouldn't?

However, contrast it with something like My Life With Master or Fiasco or Polaris or Primetime Adventures. All those other four games have a lot of explicit structuring around scenes, scene framing, who has authority when, etc. And those rules are necessary to the way those games go about supporting Story Now play.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird, Burning Wheel, Shadow of Yesterday, Riddle of Steel, and a whole other strand of games don't necessarily mess with the GMing authority structure, but have whole economies based on character flags. Flags are basically things on the character sheet that tell the rest of the play group, but especially the GM, what the player is interested in exploring regarding that character.<br/><br/>So, AW doesn't just "have a GM and character classes." It's also flag-less, has no explicit scene structure, etc., so it doesn't really require players to break actor stance in the way that earlier Forgite games did. That's why neo-trad is a reasonable label for it, though it's certainly very explicit in the text about rejecting certain of the most common aspects of trad play, especially GM fiat.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't love the neo-trad label. I just set out to examine what was happening in RPG design *outside* of indie circles in 2000-2006 or so, and called that the Trad Reformation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483838/#Comment_483838" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T02:51:18+00:00" title="May 21, 2019  2:51AM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say it has flags, but it uses subtler techniques for the GM to discover them.

So if you like to act in character, the reward should be more opportunities to act in character, not a +1 to your skill roll or a point to spend later. Giving that kind of extrinsic reward does either nothing, or CAN <i>decrease</i> the excitement for acting in character. Not everyone sees the reward as a tool of communication; they actually see the reward ... as a reward separated from the act, and when they start to try to earn the reward instead of enjoying the act in the first place, the intrinsic reward for doing it decreases. <br/><br/>The two exceptions of when extrinsic rewards influencing the intrinsic rewards negatively, and instead can affect the person's intrinsic reward <i>positively</i>:<br/>\u2022\xa0If the reward is a social one.

Intrinsic rewards are internal to a single person's psyche. Satisfaction from a job well done. The joy of learning something new. The sense of belonging that comes from interacting with friends and community.<br/><br/>The GM giving Alice a fate point is very, very, very, very much not intrinsic to Alice. You wanna say otherwise, you're making up a new definition for "intrinsic" and attaching it to a word with an established meaning, in a rather confusing way.<br/><br/>The full story on extrinsic reward / intrinsic motivation is indeed a lot more complicated than "X destroys Y," and it's much more subtle than "americans vs other folks." The nature of the interaction is more mediated by a person's internal framework for motivation, and whether external rewards are seen as affirming internal choices or imposing external constraints. (Note that a single reward framework can usually be viewed both ways, depending on mindset.)<br/><br/>But the fact is, the interaction between extrinsic reward and intrinsic motivation is A Thing. A Complicated Thing. "My game gives points that encourage behavior Foo" is often completely insufficient to actually encourage behavior Foo; for at least some people, it will actively discourage behavior Foo.<br/><br/>Here's two mechanics:<br/><br/>Every time a player is forced to make a hard bargain or ugly choice, give them Inspiration.<br/><br/>When the players turn to you to see what happens next, give them a hard bargain or ugly choice.<br/><br/>How are they similar?

try to find it.)  In Apocalypse World, you say what you're doing and the GM says what happens. Sometimes the GM tells you to roll a thing and you roll and the GM looks at the result and tells you what happens. <br/><br/>And the ratiocination around whether a fate point is really "internal" or "external"....like....come on. The entire character is external to you. All fate points are is recognition that the narrative, having tormented you for your failings, may reward you for your strengths. It's a focusing mechanic - nothing more. And it only, only, only makes sense in pulp settings.

It seems totally unrelated to the fun of the game, and there is often no objective criteria for it, which makes it further socially uncomfortable. But the former is a bigger deal to me; it just seems totally disconnected from the game we\u2019re playing and the enjoyment of it. I\u2019m sure there is a game out there where it\u2019s just the right thing (especially games where entertaining each other is the point, perhaps), but a democratic vote among a very small group and entirely unclear criteria just doesn\u2019t seem to me to add anything to the game. At least, I can\u2019t remember any instance of playing a game where such a mechanic felt like it improved the game for me. <br/><br/>I\u2019m open to alternate experiences; perhaps I just haven\u2019t played the right games yet, or with the right people! <br/><br/>The general sense, though, is of total disconnection from the actual activity at the table. I feel the same about \u201cGM XP awards\u201d; I can\u2019t particularly see how they improve the experience at the table. In comparison, many XP award mechanics that are based on *things happening in the game* - that feed back into fictional or mechanical choices being made - are exciting and effective. Getting 500 XP for braving a death trap but being clever enough to escape with the gold, that\u2019s fun. Getting awarded 500 XP because the other players staked those points on anyone betraying the Duke... equally fun. And so on.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re really curious, I\u2019d encourage you to start a new thread! You might get some varying viewpoints and opinions. Would be interesting!

I think that the real reward here is mainly social, but, also, in part because of the way the XP feeds back into future play (by giving your character greater or different abilities, which allows you to pursue greater challenges in the future).<br/><br/>The key, I think, is that the group has already established the value of a particular challenge (in this case, finding gold in death traps, let\u2019s say), and thereby challenged the player to attempt something risky. When the player steps up to the challenge and carries it off, the XP reward is a way to communicate achievement on the social level, as well. <br/><br/>So, if there was a sense that there was no real risk involved, the power of the reward would vanish. If there was a sense that it was arbitrary - or given after the fact, without expectations being established beforehand - the reward would also lack meaning and serve, at best, as a very weak incentive. If there was a sense that 5000 XP wasn\u2019t legitimately ten times more dangerous or risky or time-consuming, then there wouldn\u2019t be any real difference between 500 and 5000. That would be another failure case. (As a sidenote, the ability to distinguish quantity this way is the only reason to have points in the first place; otherwise it would almost certainly be preferable to go directly to the actual award, whether it be social recognition, opening up new possible adventures, or whatever else.)<br/><br/>I think that the points and the numbers only work and mean something when the players have all agreed to consistently connect them to real in-game events. <br/><br/>I can easily imagine a player saying, for example, that they felt the challenge was too easy, and therefore they decline the award. The points mean nothing by themselves, in other words, but are a signaling mechanism for risk, challenge, success, courage, smarts, and social reinforcement. <br/><br/>Something like that - this is not a matter I\u2019ve given great thought. <br/><br/>This is why \u201cvote for the best player\u201d type mechanics don\u2019t seem to carry much meaningful weight, to me. Perhaps in a game where the players went in knowing what their objective was (\u201cdeliver the greatest blow/most significant obstacle to our enemies\u201d), it might work. We could have a meaningful discussion about what was the most effective maneuver, idea, or strategic success, and that would feed back into future play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483930/#Comment_483930" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T18:57:25+00:00" title="May 21, 2019  6:57PM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2019 7:05PM by DeReel.">edited May 21</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No no <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> The 500XP are an affordance marker.

(New character abilities transform the form the next adventure takes, or give us access to a new area of the world, perhaps.) If instead of points we get to write the character\u2019s name on the wall, instead, that\u2019s just as good or better; but the important part is that a) we feel that it correlates to some real sense of challenge and risk, and b) it feeds back into the game, transforming it in some way.

They're perpendicular properties independent of each other. Specifically, being narrativist doesn't require you to have strange rules; well-crafted trad rules can work just fine, depending on what exactly you're trying to do.<br/><br/>AW is clearly narrativist because the most natural read of what it's about on the immediate level is "how does your character slot into the post-apocalyptic landscape as a person performing a social role", and on the wider campaign level "what happened to the world, and what are we doing about it now". These are literary premise questions, the precise sort that defines narrativism. The game doesn't try to answer them in advance, and doesn't encourage any of the players to do so; it merely asks you to play to find out. Couldn't be much clearer about being narrativist.<br/><br/>Whether this qualifies for "story now" or "story game" or "neo-trad" or whatever depends on what you mean by those words, but the narrativism bit is only in question if you read the same game text I did and somehow came to a different conclusion about its subject matter.<br/><br/>And, of course: if somebody plays AW in a non-narrativist way, then that's what they do, and good for them if it works for them. My saying that "game X is narrativist" does not mean here, and cannot possibly mean, anything more than "I think that the natural creative interest in playing this game is a narrativistic one". I could possibly see a Sim read of the game, just barely, even if it doesn't seem nearly as natural as a Nar read does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483941/#Comment_483941" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T19:51:48+00:00" title="May 21, 2019  7:51PM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Here to remind you all that the actual point of handing out Fate points or whatever for engaging in your character flaws, or pursuing your character's goals, isn't actually "rewards" but just as a tool for communication.

Exactly!<br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>I don't disagree with any of that! Thanks. I think what makes it potentially "neo-trad" (which is not a term I particularly recognize as meaningful, for the record, depending on who's talking and how they want to define it) is how less overt it is about its play priority. <br/><br/>I remember when it came out that it was a shock to a lot of Forgite gamers. We asked, "where are the character Flags?", and "these rules don't resolve conflicts! Is this task resolution again?", and "where are the reward cycles for addressing premise?", and so on and so forth. Stylistically, it's a bit of a hybrid, including all kinds of things not typically associated with Narrativist story games, like hit points, weapon stats (gun porn), sandbox-like GM prep (as opposed to Kickers and Bangs or defined moral boundaries and escalation - compare to other Narrativist games from the period which usually instruct the GM to "figure out what the players care about and then prepare dilemmas for them and escalate, escalate, escalate! Force them to take a stand on the issue!"), and escalating character powers which increase their stats and damage output.<br/><br/>Clearly, it works as a Narrativist game, but I think it marks a significant departure from game design up to that point, and started quite a new trend (games like <i>Blades in the Dark</i> seem to appeal to traditional gamers in ways that <i>My Life with Master</i>, <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Grey Ranks</i>, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, etc, never did). <br/><br/>Even <i>The Riddle of Steel</i> had its Spiritual Attributes, which were a fairly overt "indie/Forge/story game" type of thing. Apocalypse World is remarkable in the way that it has no (or almost no) overt player-facing "premise addressing" stuff at all, and even on the GM side, it's kind of subtle and presented in different language. (For instance, we get "be a fan of the players' characters" instead of "the PCs are the Protagonists of the story; make sure the story is always about them".)<br/><br/>I agree with you (you've said this before, I believe) that AW is sort of a spiritual successor to <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>; although TSoY has more overt "author stance" kind of business in it - especially Keys and BDTP - it has a lot of very traditional elements, from character building (Secrets!) to a traditional GM role.<br/><br/>Back in 2007, John Harper said:<br/><br/>"TSOY has the most beautiful alchemy to it. It straddles the traditional/story-game divide and delivers something so pure and good that it is now the thing I point to when someone asks me what an RPG is."<br/><br/>In 2010, <a href="/forums/profile/jenskot">@jenskot</a> wrote a nice mini-essay on the waves Apocalypse World made on the scene, and how a lot of "indie gamers" were confused by its design (I was one of them!). Although he is very tongue-in-cheek, his "lies" were all based on real people's reactions on the "indie scene" to Vincent's new game:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13081/apocalypse-world-lies/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13081/apocalypse-world-lies/p1</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483953/#Comment_483953" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T20:45:04+00:00" title="May 21, 2019  8:45PM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2019 9:21PM by AsIf.">edited May 21</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To this day, AW is the game I see causing the most performance anxiety among GMs who are considering running a new game.  The hybrid nature of its design is yes, close enough to Trad to make sense on one level, but different enough (read: qualitative and ambiguous enough) to send you running in circles making sure you grok it well enough not to "botch it" and embarrass yourself.  In a way, its lack of <i>utter</i> difference makes it harder to discern its <i>subtler</i> differences.<br/><br/>In part - and I can speak only of edition 1 here since I haven't seen ed 2 - some of this trouble is due to the book's terrible organization.  But that's just a sidepoint, since like most GMs preparing for their first MC performance, I remember reading and rereading and querying and googling for literally *days*, worried that there was some key structural element that I was missing, or that I would take the "wrong" artistic/philosophical stance, in short, that I would fuck it up.  <br/><br/>Of course, with help from Paul and others here and on other forums, I finally did it, and rocked it.  But no other game has ever given me such trepidation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483955/#Comment_483955" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T20:52:03+00:00" title="May 21, 2019  8:52PM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay I was helping!
