<b>BUILDING SITUATION </b><br/><br/>Situation building is collaborative, following these steps. It may take a couple of tries by the group to get a situation worth playing through, unless the players are all experienced at this kind of thing, but relax, it's pretty easy.<br/><br/><b>1. The Guide describes two characters or groups in conflict. </b><br/>These might be anything that fits the first thought of the game. The guide notes these two down on a piece of paper, and the conflict between them. For ease of memory, this usually takes the form of a â€˜networkâ€™, as shown in a couple pages, but it doesnâ€™t have to. <br/><br/><b>2. Going clockwise, everyone adds to this. </b><br/>In turn, each player describes another character or group to the situation, and describes their relationships with either two or three of the existing characters or groups. Good additions are those that... <br/><br/>- <i>Fit the "first thought":</i> The first thought, which was chosen earlier on, is the basic premise, and usually implies a genre, some different kinds of action, all sorts of stuff. All the added characters and groups should fit that. <br/><br/>- <i>Can be summarized in a few words:</i> Each added person or group should have a byline that summarizes it - instead of just adding â€œJoeâ€ as a fictional person, you might add â€œJoe, Folk Musicianâ€. <br/><br/>- <i>Want something:</i> At least one of the relationships that each person or group has should describe, or at least imply, something that person or group wants from the situation. <br/><br/>- <i>Raise the tension:</i> Each addition should bring something new to the conflict that the Guide described, expanding it in some way. This doesnâ€™t mean that they have to have chosen a side, only that their presence makes things harder, not easier, to resolve. <br/><br/><b>3. On the Guideâ€™s turn, they can end it. </b><br/>Each time it comes around to being the Guideâ€™s turn to add to the situation, they can end the cycle of adding stuff to it, or keep it going, either before or after adding something of their own. They may also declare that only characters, no more groups, may be added. A guide shouldnâ€™t stop the situation building until thereâ€™s enough stuff in the situation to allow for the next step. <br/><br/><b>4. When it ends, characters are chosen </b><br/>When the Guide calls an end to building, each of the players chooses one of the characters in the situation. Itâ€™s best, at least the first time playing, if the characters chosen have common goals or enemies, and avoid choosing directly opposed characters. <br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/><b><br/>A SAMPLE SITUATION: THE CAT SHOW</b><br/><br/>John, Kim, and Laura sit down to create a situation.  Kim is the Guide; John and Laura are playing.  Their â€˜first ideaâ€™ is to get a fairly suburban comedy about a cat show, full of nasty, backstabbing characters.<br/><br/><i>Â· Kim lays out a basic conflict:</i> Doug, a cranky old man, wants to show his cat in the cat show.  Trish, the cat show manager, refuses to let him do so.<br/><br/><i>Â· John adds a character:</i> Jim, the lazy Rent-a-Cop, who has been ordered to keep Doug out of the show, but is also Dougâ€™s drinking buddy.<br/><br/><i>Â· Laura adds a character:</i> Marcie, the Neighborhood Maven, who is keeping a close eye on her useless husband Jim, but doesnâ€™t mind Doug all that much.<br/><br/><i>Â· Kim adds a character:</i> Suzanne, the showing judge, who Marcie sucks up to but who only talks to Marcie to get a chance at her    husband, and who thinks that Trish is way too high on herself.<br/><br/><i>Kim ends it:</i> She checks in with the players, and Laura and John, after throwing a few ideas around, decide that theyâ€™ll go for it, playing  Suzanne and Doug.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://members.shaw.ca/LeviK/CatShow.jpg"/><br/><br/>------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I feel like I'm missing something crucial to getting a hot situation.<br/><br/>Any ideas?                </div>

                            Would it be too obvious to suggest that Jim and Suzanne are actually having an affair behind Marcie's back?  (Perhaps Doug knows and is torn between loyalty to his drinking buddy, who can coincidentally get him into the show, and his respect for Marcie?)                        </div>

                            *Grin*<br/><br/>That's pretty close to one of the suggestions from a little further on, in the "using mechanics" stuff - adding an affair between Jim and Suzanne is used as an example of "Game Editing" for a player.<br/><br/>I'm just thinking about the 'builder' itself; if there are any simple things I should be adding to juice it up just one more notch.                        </div>

                            Maybe examine the relationship between Trish and Doug a little more closely?  <i>Why</i> does she utterly refuse to let Doug show his cat?  Is it because of the way he dresses/looks?  Does she have something against his cat?  Has he defeated her in a different competition in the past and she's taking some petty revenge?  What will she do if Jim does let Doug in?  Is Jim's arse fired?<br/><br/>As you can possibly tell I'm just thinking out loud here ^_^                        </div>

                            Secrets immediately pop into my mind, a bit like Geoff's suggestion about the affair. Either "secrets" which characters have but players know, or secrets, which all players don't know. The first case is pretty much there, just add relationships that can be secret between two characters or something in the characters which they want to keep secret from others.<br/><br/>The second one is a bit trickier. If there are secrets from other players, maybe adding a phase where players should write down notes on secrets, which could be relationships or character secrets. Relationship secrets would be revealed to players picking a character involved with the secret, character secret likewise. Some kind of check for consistency would be good, maybe done by the guide.<br/><br/>Also, adding some kind of motives or other "colour" derived from the relationships and short descriptions could be good. Or just adding descriptive sentences to the characters to make them have more depth. Not a very good example, but: "Jim, the lazy rent-a-cop; only drinks budweiser, likes cute small animals, is allergic to cats but doesen't admit it because it might make him look dorky."                        </div>

                            Levi, sounds to me like you need something <em>happening</em>.  You have all these conflicting desires, but you have nothing that has ratchetted the simmering conflicts into something that has to be addressed and resolved <em>right now</em>.  In the example, it would have to be something like the show getting last-minute national coverage, which makes everybody care more about what's going to happen tomorrow.  Or Doug's cat is found dead.  Or something that takes what you've got here and electrifies it.                        </div>

                            Maybe the characters need more of a drive to change the status quo?  Most of these are static relationships.  Protagonists do well if they have a ruling passion that drives the story.  It can be brought about by the big bang, or the bang could be an opportunity to pursue an existing passion.  I think setting up a situation like this is very cool, but you want to avoid people sitting there after the creation and thinking, "Now what?"  They should have a good idea what their characters' goals are and how they can try to achieve them.                        </div>

It'd be easy enough to change "Wants something" to "Wants something to change / happen", in that sense.  Which implies action.  Which is good.                        </div>

                            I'd suggest that you consider pairing that up with other characters who don't want that aspect of the status quo to change, or who want it to change in a different direction.                        </div>

                            Right on, Mike.  Opposing goals = adversity = awesome <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And I'd make it "<i>passionately</i> wants something to change/happen" to make sure the intensity dial is up.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great collaborative implementation of the conflict web stuff, something I've been thinking about a lot lately.  Simple yet effective.                        </div>

                            I'm with JBR on the need for an event of some kind - I'm assuming you want the game to be "a bunch of separate games", i.e. scenes with each of the characters, not necessarily with each other?                        </div>

                            One possible approach: Trimurti.<br/><br/>[Pahusacheta Nahasapeemapetilon] No, I am serious! [/Pahusacheta Nahasapeemapetilon] <br/><br/>There are three attitudes one can have to an element or potential element of the situation: Create, Preserve, Destroy. ("Transform" can be seen as a special case of "create", for simplicity, though you could argue that it's all three going on at once.)<br/><br/>So: Doug wants to create a situation where he is showing in the cat show. Trish wants to preserve the current situation, where he's not. Suzanne may want to destroy Marcie's marriage, or create an affair with Jim. Marcie wants to preserve her marriage, preserve Jim's job, create a closer connection with Suzanne...<br/><br/>I'm not sure where to take that, though, just throwing it out as a thought-in-progress.<br/><br/>EDIT: And by the way, if you want to plunder my parallel <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Acts%20of%20Desperation_4.pdf" rel="nofollow">Acts of Desperation</a> project for anything, feel free. I'm planning to release it as CC-Attribution in any case.                        </div>
