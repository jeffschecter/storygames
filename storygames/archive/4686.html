I didn't want buyoffs, because I wanted to keep character development more streamlined. Looking back at the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=739" rel="nofollow">character arc chains discussion</a>, I figured that instead of having open buyoffs and acquisitions, I could simply give two possible follow-up Keys for each Key that a character possesses.  <a href="http://www.berengad.com/public/Kallij_Boryok.pdf" rel="nofollow">See example here.</a><br/><br/>Now, the initial criticism of that is probably, "what if it feels more natural for the character to develop to a totally different Key? This might not fit what happens in the game!" But on the other hand, if you've got two possible developments in front of you, chances are that you'll be able to play more toward those. That is, the game would be more focused, maybe; a bit more predictable, but also with more emphasis on playing toward something rather than "sandboxing."  That would make it more suitable for a prepared module.<br/><br/>What do y'all think?  Any other thoughts on this or open vs. constrained character development in general?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105562/#Comment_105562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T13:21:58+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  1:21PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I generally think this kind of constraint is powerful and underused in games.

The character progress challenging what he was to become what he will be.<br/><br/>Adding limitations is as saying "no, you can't change the character too much, the system need to protect the character from too big life-changing developments". The system protect the character initial concept, and try to simulate a "plausible" linear development (if I have understood how the allowable future keys will be chosen)<br/><br/>I'm not saying that it could not work. I think it could. But it's not a trivial change, and should be maybe tied with other system changes (pool refreshes, and eventually even the way combat works) to avoid some incoherence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105659/#Comment_105659" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T08:37:48+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  8:37AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, what if the constraints on the Keys are exactly the big life changing ones?

One of my enterely not-approved not-"ufficial", not-too-thought-of manner of describing the difference between narrativism and simulationism to people is "in a  SIM, the system (in the Lumpley sense, it could even be the master or the other players) tell you what your character should do, in NAR it ask you".<br/><br/>At the same time, I can see as EVERY kind of game design can be seen as the building of a set of rescrictions to create a specific kind of play, and that there rescritions foster creativity (even the concept of "key" is a restriction about what you have to do to get experience, but simply by being explicit they give ideas and foster creativity), so it's trade-off.<br/><br/>I think that to allow for strong thematic statements, the choice should still be very wide. I mean, from Guardian, you should be able to go to Vengeance OR Coward OR Faith OR Glittering Gold OR the Masochist OR Outcast (I can see any one of the as the outcome of losing your ward. You can seek vengeance, you can lose any faith in your ability and became fearful, you can find god searching atonement, you can became disenchanted and begin to thing only to yourself, you can try to punish yourself or you can think yourself unworthy of your status).  This would not be so much of a limitation, as a way to SUGGEST these changes to the players. Get them thinking about the way they want to go.<br/><br/>Some of them are tied to specific character background (Outcast, for example) so maybe there should be some sort of customization at the time of character creation on the allowable choices...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105842/#Comment_105842" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T02:18:41+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  2:18AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about this: When a player picks a key; he defines one possible follow-up; and someone else the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105886/#Comment_105886" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T07:10:17+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  7:10AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, better yet, the person selects the Key and everyone that wants to can define a forked Key result.

And I'd love to see a whole list or chart of linked Keys; I'd spend a while just tracing the possible links with my finger, imagining what kind of character could go through those changes.  <br/><br/>Who knows how it would work in Actual Play, but I think it would be interesting to make a few REALLY BIG, constrained decisions.  Like after Key of Vengance, you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only </span> go to Key of Conscience OR Key of Bloodlust.  That fits a half-dozen of my favorite movies and books.  And, knowing this in advance, you've picked Key of Vengance as your choice after you bought off Key of the Guardian, because eventually your character will either strive to become a better man, or a much worse one.  <br/><br/>That sounds like a helluva lot of fun to me, and if it isn't Nar, so much the worse for Nar.  <br/>(<i>nervously slips away before the GNS police get a lock on his location</i>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
