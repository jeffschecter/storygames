                    All righty, we got our group together for more Primetime Adventures kickassedness this weekend and it was even better than the first time we played.<br/>
<br/>
I said "I'm curious to see what we do with a franchise. As your Producer, I command that we pitch a show based on a franchise!   You know, Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate, Buffy, Firefly, just pick some TV show or movie world that we have been put in charge of a TV series based on."  After scratching some off the list and adding to it, we decide to do a Buffyverse show based on - or ripping off - the Clerks/Mallrats series.  We established that there wouldn't be any explicit crossover, but the "rules" of the Buffyverse (as in how vampires and demons and magic worked) would be more or less the same.<br/>
<br/>
It would be set in the Sunnydale Mall, where the four protagonists would all be clerks in the "lower-rent" shops, while their nemeses would work in the upscale shops and try to take over/destroy the world or other dastardly magical/occult plans.<br/>
<br/>
The characters were:<br/>
<br/>
Blyss, the goth necromancer-wannabe who worked in Build-A-Bear and had a crush on the Discovery Store nerd up the way.  She was forced to wear pigtails and a little Build-a-Bear apron.  She also had a connection with the crazy old Chinese guy in the Bamboo Hut store who secretly knew everything that was going on.<br/>
<br/>
Mike, the video game store guy who had to win everything he was involved in.  His intro scene was him putting on a catcher's mask, football pads, hoisting his boffer katana and shouting "I LOVE LAUNCH DAY!!"  He had phenomenal dexterity.<br/>
<br/>
Grant, the comic book store guy who was a slacker/asshole and had a big mouth and a best friend named "Ringo" who had seen every movie ever and as a result always thought he knew everything that was going on but who was completely wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Zora was a half-demon with super-long fingernail/claws, she worked in the Disney store for her new, non-demonic stepmother who was the super-bouncy store manager. She had a demonic compact - literally,a black mirror that she could use to contact her mother who was "transferred back to hell", never said why. (I think, typing this out, she was probably sent back when the Hellmouth was closed in the main Buffy series!)<br/>
<br/>
As we were writing up the characters we also wrote up the stores where they worked.  Obviously as the Producer I confidently told everyone we could get clearance for whatever store they wanted the characters to work in. "Even if we make the Disney store horrible?" "FUCK DISNEY!" I said, pounding the table. "WHEN THEY'VE WON AS MANY ACE AWARDS AS I HAVE, THEY CAN COME AND TALK TO ME ABOUT THEIR FUCKING STORES!! I SAY FUCK DISNEY!!" Who says there's no powergaming or GM fiat in PTA? So we had the Disney Store, Build-A-Bear, and two fictional stores: Adamantium Giant Comics &amp; Games, about which you now know everything you need to know, and Lazergamez, a video game chain store with five franchises in Sunnydale Mall alone.  (One on each 'arm' of the five-pointed star that the mall forms, naturellement.)<br/>
<br/>
The bad guys worked for Nordstrom's, Saks Fifth, Performance Footwear andSharper Image. Also they met every morning at the Starbuck's where they all ordered complicated drinks and schemed for the day (the barrista there was their frightened toady.)  They were named Chad, Kristiana, Dominique and Trevor. Trevor was the bad guy who was constantly fucking things up and getting shit on by the other characters.<br/>
<br/>
It was going to be a network show, so no cussing or explicit sex scenes, although sex-related hijinx was okay, as well as mild (late night type) cussing.<br/>
<br/>
Other NPCs invented during brainstorming and used in dialogue and connections included Tracy the Cinnabon girl who "had those crazy eyes" and was a former girlfriend of Mike, Marcy, a former member of the group who "got out" of the mall and who we intended to return at some point in the season, Professor Neckbeard, who had camped out for five days in order to get his preordered Cubestation 180 ("It's like the 360 except it...goes the other way!!" Mike said, waggling his fingers in al directions.), Larry, the ultra-stealthy kung-fu security guard (a former Initiative commando reduced to working as a security guard in a mall. Too bad the GI Bill doesn't cover secret organizations disbanded in disgrace! Ha ha. Ahem.) <br/>
<br/>
The show opened with a title card: BLACK FRIDAY, with a brief scene of the evil cabal making their evil plans and then cut to Blyss trying to make sense out of the memo that she got to arrange the 'wait here' cones outside her store "just so", with green cones on green stickers and the bears pointing in different directions. While she is trying to figure it out, Zora arrives wearing a Cinderella costume - Trish (stepmother and manager) insisted they all come in Disney costumes for Black Friday. Her claws have torn through the gloves. Blyss is stunned, but Zora is uber-cranky, plucks the crucial memo from Blyss' hands and throws it away. The situation is not helped when Grant comes bustling up going "hey-yo!" and Mike approaches in his boffer gear saying "They're gettin' HUNGRY outside those doors!" A passing maintenance man, Julio, picks up the crumpled up memo and glares daggers at Zora, then mutters in an unknown tongue. The two girls clearly think the two boys are a bit dense. Zora orders them to go get coffee. After much banter it turns out that the girls go for coffee first while the boys "finish up with the cones", more or less by throwing them randomly, although we don't see the full impact of their work until later in the show. I call a conflict - the only coffee place open yet is Starbucks, will they be humiliated by the upscale clerks and kept from their coffee, or will they get coffee? They get coffee due to Trevor's insistence on trashtalking Mike before their big Dance Dance Revolution showdown later that day.                </div>

                            Back to the disney store with Zora and Trish where Trish is instructing Zora to be "Happy happy HAPPY!" and giving her a new "multicultural greeting" she has to read when she welcomes people to the Disney store. "It was in a memo..." and the last greeting on the card is a demonic chant. Still, Zora doesn't notice anything wrong as the place floods with kids and the store becomes a dark, twisted Disney store due to their chants. She hates it there anyway. Nevertheless, when her compact 'rings' (I just picked a random ringtone and performed it VERY DARK AND LOW-PITCHED), she can't quite make out what her mother is trying to say. There's all sorts of intereference, which is weird because it's usually crystal clear all the way to hell.<br/>
<br/>
Over the next few scenes, we see Blyss coping with two soccer moms in a catfight over the last Conductor Bear voicebox (the head of the bear went flying one way, the leg went the other way), Mike delaying Trevor from going to perform his ritual chanting due to kicking his ass in DDR and having "just one more rematch" (he also got Millicent's - Trevor's girlfriend who he was trying to impress - digits), Zora gave the "multicultural greeting" card to a little kid to read while she went on break (resulting in a story by Cynthia Chavez, Action News Nine on child labor in the Disney store, and also asked Trish, who was dressed up as Glinda, why she was a MGM character in the Disney store. Trish stood, tremebling a moment, and then said "WHERE WERE THE PARENTS??" and rushed off.)  and then finally they figured out from Zora's mom and the Bamboo Hut guy that the whole world was in terrible danger unless they stopped the upscale clerks. A preliminary showdown at Santa's Mansion in the center of the mall-pentagram ended in disaster and everyone fleeing comically as Dominique and Kristiana demonstrated their command of evil magic by laser beaming the shit out of everything the heroes threw at them. They had to find the diagram of the line that was supposed to be outside Build-A-Bear which Julio had taken. Breaking into the secret passages under the Mall, they discovered four identical Julios ("Clearly he's Lithuanian," said Ringo earlier. "I saw this Lithuanian softporn and the language they were speaking sounded just like Julio.")  playing cards...after some banter, Mike just attacked one with his boffer katana and in the fracas, Zora managed to grab the diagram and they rushed for the Bamboo Hut, where the Bamboo Hut guy identified the most likely place for the backup plan of human sacrifice - the escalators near Santa's Workshop! Meanwhile we also saw insert scenes of the huge crowd outside Lazergames pounding on the doors Mike forgot to open, being tear gassed by riot police, and the upscale clerks finding how much the heroes had screwed up their ritual just by being idiots. Chad went to the men's room and in a stall discovered one of the Build-A-Bear line signs, a happy teddy bear on a cone in the toilet holding a sign, "DON'T FORGET YOUR PACKAGE!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They went to the Discovery Store to ask the nerd there about how to stop escalator sacrifices, and he gave them a lesson on escalators and tried to sell them a video about it.  Blyss was all "he's soooo smart and dreamy..."   Trish, having the nearest thing to an innocent heart that the upscale clerks could find on short notice, was strapped down to the escalator by the upscale kids and was going to be chopped to bits. Zora fought Chad with a giant candy cane, Blyss threw the conductor bear head to hit the emergency stop button, and Grant (who had the edge Knows Everything Correspondence School Can Teach Him) found the breakers under the escalator and pulled them, saving the day...for now!<br/>
<br/>
We decided to pick up the show for a five-show season:<br/>
<br/>
1. Aisle of Misfit Toys. On the day after Christmas, the biggest "return" day of the year, the upscale clerks animate the rejected toys to become their army of destruction.<br/>
<br/>
2.  One Day Only. A Lazergamez demo console is caught in a magical battle between the upscale clerks and the heroes and gains the power to 'reset' the same day over and over. Mike's spotlight episode: will he just keep resetting the day until he wins every single thing he can, or will he accept that he "can't win 'em all?" and move on?<br/>
<br/>
3.  Shop Til You Drop. Blyss is tempted into a deal with an upscale clerk for necromantic knowledge, but they were just using her to raise an army of shopper zombies.  Blyss' spotlight episode: will she have a decent date with the Discovery Store guy or will her own undead ruin everything?<br/>
<br/>
4.  President's Day.  The upscale clerks still don't get paid much - that's why they're starting a magically-empowered counterfeiting ring. When the Adamantium Games &amp; Comics manager is implicated and fired, who will be next in this noir sendup? Grant's spotlight episode: Will he actually put his skills to work at achieving something, anything for himself? Or just slack off?<br/>
<br/>
5.  Blowout Prices.  The upscale clerks actually manage to raise a number of demons - including Zora's mom.  Zora's spotlight episode: Her strange luck is causing all sorts of havoc - will she be able to deal with her heritage and her bizarre luck, or will she coincidentally cause the destruction...of all mankind?<br/>
<br/>
It was fucking awesome.                        </div>

                            Experimental rule I tried:<br/>
<br/>
"Everybody write your Connections on this 3x5 card. I'm going to scramble them up. Everyone pick one. Put it back if it's one of yours. You will be playing that Connection." Worked great - one player had to veto playing Ringo because she didn't know anything about movies, but other than that it was hilarious fun.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: oh noes, he changed the rulez! PTA must be brokan! :)                        </div>

                            I should also add that afterwards, when we were watching TV, and the cellphone commercial came on with the four guys from the other cellphone companies trying to get the one cellphone company guy to change his awesome program, and one of the guys, a glasses-wearing nerd, goes, "I got the carne asada. It was awesome." and everyone looks at him like he's an idiot, the players unanimously agreed that this was MY protagonist if I ever wanted to play in it.                        </div>

<i>I also dig how you seem to be relishing your "role" as Producer.</i><br/>
<br/>
Actually, I also thought, "Thank god."<br/>
<br/>
While I think many GMs are well-meaning in these new-fangled games as they toss away as much authority and power as they can -- the vacuum left behind when no one is actaully claiming responsibility for getting creative tone set can be debelitating.<br/>
<br/>
Someone is ALWAYS responsible for picking up the baton. Even in Roach (where it may not be obvious, but is still present). If no one does it, everyone's left to make their best stab at what's going on -- and there's a squishy, flotsom-like feel to the endevour.<br/>
<br/>
Great job man. Sounds terrific.<br/>

                            Yeah...it's interesting, PTA has this whole "writer/producer" vibe in the rules, but there's not much done with it.  I'm assuming this is because when they're acting as writers, players are supposed to be putting issues and scenes in that they in real life would be enthused about, not necessarily what they think a TV writer might throw in. "I'm playing the one that puts gender issues in everything!" or whatnot.<br>
<br>
Still, it's just too fun for me to inject stereotypical producer stuff into the pitch/plotting process. For example, in the first scene, it was decided that Zora and Blyss would be introduced first for "girl bonding time". I said "If you want to make them lesbians, and have them make out, that gave the original show a boost in the ratings, and I can completely get it cleared with standards and practices..." And the players went "NO!" And I said, "Okay, okay...I wouldn't want to step on your 'artistic vision'." with the scare quotes. Everyone (me included) was cracking up.<br>
<br>
In an earlier PTA play with the same group (pilot not finished yet, may never be finished due to schedules), one of the characters had a 'grad student' edge, I nonchalantly said, "As a TV producer, of course, I never finished high school, so I'll be relying on you to decide what that means."                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            When we played PTA, I dug up an mp3 to use as the theme music.  Before each session, we'd play the theme music.  It was almost like the opening Key Phrase in Polaris.  Very effective.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>

                            Hi Jason,<br/>
<br/>
So is roleplaying the metaroles, like producer or writer, something you found in the rules? Or something you added?<br/>

                            Well, the 'producer' terminology is definitely used in the game...I don't know if the 'writer' terminology is, but certainly the 'pitch' terminology informs it...and I don't roleplay it the whole time, after all, a lot of what the Producer in PTA does is more like what a director and writer would do in real life. But it was just enough to add some spice to it, if that makes sense?<br/><br/>One thing that adds to this is that I am a DVD commentary track junkie. Absolute junkie.  All that inside baseball stuff is great fun to me.                        </div>

                            Jason, yeah that's totally awesome.  I too am fond of taking a firmer stance as "Producer" (to avoid the pitfalls that Christopher pointed out aptly above), and you took that football of Producer and ran a 90-yard touchdown.  I should really, REALLY get into it more in my next session and see what happens.<br/><br/>"No hippie shit, I'm the Motherfucking Producer.  I write the checks.

                            Just finished the first episode of the regular season: "Aisle of Misfit Toys". On the day after Christmas, one of Blyss' experimental necromancy spells goes awry when she casts it at the same time the Upscale Cabal is casting (from their very preppy, Hot Topic ritual circle) a spell to make a mannequin into their enslaved automaton.  This introduces a new character, the animated mannequin Jasmine Nordstrom (after the store where she was awakened), who joins the group on this, her spotlight episode.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed this time through was that neither Jasmine's player nor the rest of the players much wanted to deal with Jasmine's issue, "what it is to be human", except on the level of material for jokes. And PTA chugged right through it without so much as a cough or a splutter! Beautiful!<br/><br/>The animation spell went awry, animating the eerie, deflated skins of the teddy bears in the Build-A-Bear shop, turning the Disney store into a hellhole, and making the Santa's workshop animatronic reindeer into  fanged monstrosities.  Highlights include Grant arming the D&amp;D geeks and sending them into the steam tunnels for a "LARP", with promises of Magic cards and "a girl will smile at you at the end".  Larry the security guard and Mike fighting waves of Beanie Babies back to back...and a lucky draw of the cards capturing half the group and forcing Grant and Jasmine to team up and rescue them.  (They were tied up with Christmas lights.)  Still, it wasn't an unalloyed success, as Dominique retained some control over Jasmine despite her teaming up with the group and even getting a job at the low-class perfume store Dr. Smellgood's...(Being a mannequin with no sense of smell helps sometimes...)                        </div>

                            Naturally, when I do the website for this game, it will be in the form of a 17 year old girl complaining that FOX cancelled her favorite series without even giving it a chance.  "Just like Firefly and....and Anchorwoman!"                        </div>
