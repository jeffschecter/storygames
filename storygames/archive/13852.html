2007, 09:53:10 AM \xbb<br/><br/><br/>So we as a design community have a problem, which I think has been sort of flailingly addressed on Story Games, but it is a real problem and I think it merits serious thought.\xa0 It's a problem with our design community, it's methods, and most particularly the social structures surrounding it, so I think it should be discussed here, on the Forge, because the "us" I'm talking about is the participants on this site, which I include myself as a member of.<br/><br/>Here's the problem: People are publishing half-baked and unfinished games.\xa0 These games are thus confusing and frustrating to play.<br/><br/>(Note: I don't want to talk about what role, if any, other "diaspora" sites like GameCraft, knife-fight, or Story Games have in this problem.\xa0 I want to talk about the culture here, at the Forge.)<br/><br/>Also, just to let you know, I have no proposed solutions for these problems.\xa0 I don't even know where to begin to resolve them.<br/><br/>I think that the primary reason for this problem is a result of unplaytested games, games only playtested in awkward circumstances (one-shots, on-line play, etc.), and most especially games hurried out to get them ready for GenCon.<br/><br/>The first two are deeply related, and I think may be inextricably tied to the internet nature of the forum.\xa0 The internet is attractive to "lonely gamers" who would like to play, but can't because they don't have a play group.\xa0 I think we've seen a lot of games come and go here which are largely designed because the designer is bored and wants to be playing, and unplaytested or playtested poorly because the designer has no group to playtest it with.<br/><br/>I don't even know where to start with these two.<br/><br/>Here's the third one: The rush to get a game out at GenCon.\xa0 I think that this is a lot more thorny problem than those of us who have already published games and sold them at GenCon think it is.<br/><br/>Being a designer, here, has a lot of social status.\xa0 It's a complicated social status, compounded by when you joined the Forge, who else likes your game, how your sales are, if you're doing anything that's seen as innovative, etc.\xa0 But it's definitely there, and designers have a privileged role (their own forums, for example.)<br/><br/>I don't think that this is a bad thing!\xa0 Social reward for good behavior is an awesome thing, it's what makes communities (particularly creative communities) go, and that's all good.<br/><br/>I think that there are three things that distinguish insider and outsider social status at the Forge.<br/>1) Have you published a game?<br/>2) Have you met in person with a bunch of other high status people and gotten to know them?<br/>3) Is your game, if you have one, financially or play-wise successful?<br/><br/>I think it's pretty obvious that all three of these things push people to having a game to sell at GenCon, our largest social event as well as a really good opportunity to kick-start your sales and actual play, as well as a chance to get your other games playtested and polished.<br/><br/>See, the thing is, it's all well and good for me or someone else who's already got a known, published game to go like "don't rush this game out the door for GenCon, sit back and polish it!\xa0 I mean, look at me!\xa0 I've spent three years getting Bliss Stage ready."\xa0 But that's beside the point.\xa0 I don't have a lot to gain from that: I already have the social status of being a designer.\xa0 To someone who doesn't, rushing a game out is a great idea, because the quality of your game is not nearly as important as the status of being a designer.<br/><br/>So how do we address this problem?\xa0 We're going to have to take a really hard look at how we apportion social status in the community, decide how maybe we ought to apportion it, and make an effort to try to re-align our thinking into a new social hierarchy.\xa0 We'll need to take a look at what it means to have joined the Forge when, what it means to be a designer, what it means to have a successful game, and what effects that has on our behavior and social interactions.<br/><br/>There are some positive steps: The Nerdlies, Go Play directionals, JiffyCons and Forge Midwest provide us with a new, intimate, social arena, where non-designers and others can pick up respect and social status.\xa0 The Ashcan Front could be *huge* in this respect but I worried that its reputation amongst those designers it's trying to reach has been undercut by its presentation.\xa0 But I think that we need to also think hard about how we interact here, on the Forge, and who we listen to and why.\xa0 That's hard!\xa0 Are we willing to do it?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben <br/><br/>Report to moderator \xa0  Logged<br/><br/>These are our Games<br/>This is my Blog </blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>Remi Treuer<br/>Member<br/><br/>Posts:

the question of how to get more useful playtest is the biggest one when it comes to moving along on a design. It's an enormous obstacle that's difficult to overcome.<br/><br/>Clinton, Jason, and I have a strict, formal, 'No Playtest' rule for our games. This came up because we playtested a few games and they were really not fun for us. We have limited time to play together, and we didn't want to spend it struggling with an incomplete design. I also don't think we gave much useful feedback on the games we did playtest.<br/><br/>How do you get over this? How do you encourage people to sacrifice their fun for your sake without already having a reputation? I ask because I'm about to embark on my first design, and as someone who has only playtested local games in the last year, I don't feel like I especially _deserve_ to have my game playtested.<br/><br/>At the same time, it has been my experience that playtesting well is very, very hard. I'm not very good at finding conflicts in taste (which can be deadly to any game, no matter how finished) and problems with rules. I suppose the answer here is to playtest more.<br/><br/>Finally, I worry about the critique process. I think critique is more effective if there's some basis of trust between the participants. I am not saying mollycoddle people, I'm saying make sure you're at a point in your communication where your concerns will be heard clearly. If I get a blast of strongly-worded fire from someone I barely know, I will probably decide to ignore that person. This may be a personal failing on my part, but if the critique process is so scary it chases people off, it doesn't serve anyone.<br/><br/>How do you get playtests? How do you playtest? How do you communicate the critiques from playtest so they are heard?<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313606/#Comment_313606" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T06:00:48+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  6:00AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2011 6:02AM by Todd_L.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Ben Lehman<br/>Member<br/><br/>Posts: 2094<br/><br/>Blissed<br/><br/>Re: Half-Baked Games and Design Culture<br/>\xab Reply <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a> on: April 25, 2007, 07:41:48 AM \xbb<br/><br/><br/>I'd like to tell a personal story, which maybe will illustrate this.<br/><br/>In 2004, I volunteered to be a booth monkey at the Forge.\xa0 Okay, technically I was Driftwood's demo coordinator, but I was a booth monkey.\xa0 As a coincidence, I also had a half-baked, rushed out game published that year as well, called Over the Bar.\xa0 It was published in the No Press Anthology, it hadn't been playtested, and it was generally just a joke made in response to a game design challenge on the Forge.\xa0 (Hey, people who are looking down their noses at the Game Designer Challenges thread at Story Games -- we used to do that on the Forge all the time.\xa0 In fact, I'm not sure why we don't anymore.\xa0 Good topic for Endeavour.)<br/><br/>While I was there, I made friends with a bunch of people: Mike Holmes, Scott Knipe, Vincent Baker.\xa0 I mention these particular people because they are key to my experience, not because they're the only friends I made.\xa0 You see, I had this game I had written for Game Chef that year called Polaris, which I was kinda bummed didn't win, and had been idly poking with the development stick while I worked on my real project, a game called Tactics.<br/><br/>Mike took me aside at one point during the Con and asked if I was developing Polaris at all.\xa0 "Yeah, kinda," I said.\xa0 "Good," he told me, "because it's an incredible game."\xa0 (This was before the game had any of that trendy "key phrases" crap, too.)\xa0 Hearing this from the guy who marked my game down for not using "assault" clearly enough was a huge thing.\xa0 Even huger was talking with Scott (who I downright *worshipped* for Charnel Gods) about depression, metaphor, and the end of the world as a literary device, and having him take me and my game seriously and directly.<br/><br/>Also, I made friends with this guy, Vincent Baker, who I totally loved because he wrote this bitching game Hungry, Desperate, and Alone.\xa0 There's a funny story about that, but it probably doesn't belong here.<br/><br/>So, later, I'm bumming around in a post-college haze, and I realize "hey, wait, Vincent lives in Western Mass.\xa0 I'm in Providence.\xa0 I can totally take the commuter rail out to somewhere near him."\xa0 Because I'm friends with him, I can write him and ask if I can come out and visit for a couple of days.\xa0 "Yeah, sure," he says, "let's play Polaris."\xa0 "We can't play Polaris!" I said.\xa0 "It sucks!"<br/><br/>And that's how Meg, Vincent, and Emily became a key support community for me: Helping me out through playtesting, game design discussion, and such.\xa0 Without them, Polaris would never have been published.\xa0 It'd still be a half-baked game that I kicked around once in a while.<br/><br/>There's a direct line here: Without the social bonding that came from working at GenCon, I would not have had to resources to bring Polaris to completion.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>How can we make this more accessible?<br/><br/>I can think of a few things:<br/>1) Recruit booth monkeys again.\xa0 I have no idea if this is feasible or not, but it would help this problem enormously.<br/>2) Open up our social scene at GenCon more than a little bit.<br/>3) Continue to expand and participate in events like the Double Exposure cons, the Nerdlies, the Go Play Directionals, JiffyCon, and Forge Midwest, while working hard to make these cons opportunities for neophyte game designers to make professional and social connections with experienced designers who can help them through playtesting and publication.<br/>4) Consider the privileges that being a "designer" gives online (and, let's face it, that often means "person who sells at GenCon"), and open those up to more people.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's more and other things to be done.\xa0 My goal is to point out the problem, not to dictate how it should be addressed.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>xenopulse<br/>Member<br/><br/>Posts: 527<br/><br/>Heretic Forgite<br/><br/><br/><br/>Re: Half-Baked Games and Design Culture<br/>\xab Reply <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2315&amp;Mode=like">#15</a> on: April 25, 2007, 02:30:50 PM \xbb<br/><br/><br/>Ron,<br/><br/>In the spirit of critical self-reflection, do you think that Sorcerer, with its long period of development, lives up to its potential straight out of the book for most people who bought it?<br/><br/><br/>Report to moderator \xa0  Logged<br/><br/>- Christian<br/>Beast Hunters<br/>Anima Prime<br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>Ron Edwards<br/>Global Moderator<br/>Member<br/><br/>Posts: 16491<br/> <br/><br/>Re: Half-Baked Games and Design Culture<br/>\xab Reply <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2316&amp;Mode=like">#16</a> on: April 25, 2007, 06:26:35 PM \xbb<br/><br/><br/>Christian, <br/><br/>Whatever Sorcerer is to the people who bought it, it's not because it's half-baked. If anyone thinks I picked their pocket, then it's because the book - what it is, as game or text - isn't what they wanted or isn't good in some fundamental way.<br/><br/>Sorcerer went through the ashcan process. If it's no good now, or not good ever, or not well-done, that's a feature of its real, up-front nature. It's due entirely to my own deficiencies, not to a failure of the process itself. I own what it is, I can't say, "oh whoops, forgot that bit, sorry, I wasn't thinking."<br/><br/>This is key. I'm not guaranteeing that anyone will produce the world-class spiff perfect game if they pay attention to this point I'm making in this thread. What I'm saying is that recognizing and valuing the ashcan step makes it more likely that you will put out the game that you want to, which then can be judged on its merits or lack of merits without missing pieces, broken pieces, or weird shit of that sort.<br/><br/>Best, Ron<br/><br/>P.S. Ben, you might be interested to know that Universalis was ages in appearing. Or, for that matter, so was Legends of Alyria. Waiting for a game is no big deal, except if one buys into the poisonous and wholly adolescent status-culture that seems to have sprung up over the last three years. ("What game did you publish?" "Oh, you don't have a game?" smug nod) That culture is a blight and needs to die.<br/><br/><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313608/#Comment_313608" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T06:09:52+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  6:09AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was hoping you'd written a game called AMMO, Todd.<br/><br/>(Write AMMO, Todd.

That somehow individuals like Lehman or Edwards or Baker or whoever are in a position of social authority, and that thus their opinions should be subject to a higher degree of respect (or, often, scrutiny). I don't know if that's the case. I don't think Lehman or Edwards would say so. In fact, I think that the broad, sweeping opinions that they offer are prefaced on the assumption that they are just-dudes-with-ideas and that those ideas aren't prescriptive doctrine. I think it's exactly this assumption that allows them to feel comfortable making big, sweeping statements.<br/><br/>I can understand why we'd think otherwise. After all, the mainstream RPG market is distinctly hierarchical, with an unbridgeable gap between publishers/designers and players and significant barriers to entry for new products and ideas. However, those distinctions are meaningless in a community where most players are also designers and <i>every</i> player <i>could be</i>, and where the barriers to publication are nominal. Edwards, Lehman, Baker et al. have no ability to prevent any game from being published, nor do they have any interest in doing so. They also can't make a game be published. Perhaps they can offer a review or a blurb for your back cover or some promotional, but that's a very different thing from possessing real power within the community. And I think they understand that.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not saying this to pick sides in this debate. I'm saying it because it's something that I only just recently realized and I feel like it has some bearing on this debate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313695/#Comment_313695" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T11:30:46+00:00" title="February 22, 2011 11:30AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            whduryea, andy, and the hold steady seem to be saying:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtLnies1IIw" rel="nofollow">Baby take off your beret<br/>Everyone's a critic and most people are DJs<br/>And everything gets played</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_313699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313699/#Comment_313699" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T11:37:41+00:00" title="February 22, 2011 11:37AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2011 11:43AM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there actually a problem with play-testing?

You may choose to participate, or to sit and observe. <br/><br/>And after the game you give each player a form with some pointed questions on your game, and leave them to fill it out (let them fill it out before talking about the game, so you get each one to concentrate on his/her experience).

Be sure to go forward. Do not let the conversation "degenerate" into a debate. Keep it pointed and with your game in focus. Follow up on any comments that are vague, asking clarifying questions, trying to get their meaning. Be interested in their experience and meaning. End it all by asking if anyone have something to add, anything; praise, critique, curiosa ...<br/><br/>Take notes if any player say something interesting, be polite, give thanks for their help and opinions (all of them), and wish them a safe journey home.

That somehow individuals like Lehman or Edwards or Baker or whoever are in a position of social authority, and that thus their opinions should be subject to a higher degree of respect (or, often, scrutiny). I don't know if that's the case. I don't think Lehman or Edwards would say so. In fact, I think that the broad, sweeping opinions that they offer are prefaced on the assumption that they are just-dudes-with-ideas and that those ideas aren't prescriptive doctrine. I think it's exactly this assumption that allows them to feel comfortable making big, sweeping statements.</blockquote>\nSure, they'd say they're just dudes like us, but dudes like us <i>don't</i> decide that we know what's best for broad swaths of people, and decide it so firmly that we're willing to intensely vilify those who don't accord with our judgment.<br/><br/>As for being given respect, I think it's a fair bet that if you had written Ben's missive, you would have received a lot more angry and dismissive responses than he did.

My experience is that there are a lot of dudes on the internet who like to make <i>big</i> statements full of generalizations. I know I do sometimes. I think they do it mostly to spark debate. (Yes, OK, you could say "troll.") People who read these statements then respond with counterarguments. (If we're still not being nice, we could say "flame.") You could say this isn't a productive way to communicate--and it often isn't--but I do think it's a good way to topple accepted notions and create an interesting dialogue. I don't think that the people who do this expect to be universally agreed with. I think they know they are inviting dissent and conflict and welcome it.<br/><br/>I could be totally wrong, but I think that's what Ben Lehman was doing. I think it was more about trying to upend a sacred cow and start a debate than it was him saying, "This is how to design a game, and I should fucking know, because I created <i>Polaris</i>, god damn it."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>As for being given respect, I think it's a fair bet that if you had written Ben's missive, you would have received a lot more angry and dismissive responses than he did.

I'm just not sure if it's Ben who is responsible for that difference, or if it's the community's perception of him. I guess it's not a hugely important distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313759/#Comment_313759" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T14:50:02+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  2:50PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: mjbauer</cite>P.S.
