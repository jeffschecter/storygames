I continue to pour out the love from my overflowing heart as a result of the awesome Endgame Minicon.<br/><br/><b>The Setup</b><br/><br/>The system: Spirit of the Century<br/>The modifications: Starting with 5 Fate, 3 Stress<br/>6 Aspects and 3 Stunts filled in at the start of play.<br/><br/>The blurb: Welcome to the future! It's 2008 and mankind has never seen such progress! We have flying cars, rocket pads in every city, hotels on the moon, and picture radio. And with all of our vast technology, we've finally defeated the Martians in the Great Space War opening up deep space for exploration. But when the crew of the rocketship USS Clio investigate a mysterious radio transmission on Jupiter's largest moon, their ship is struck by something from the surface and they soon find themselves stranded on an alien world!<br/><br/>Aspects being used in the narrative are in quotes.<br/><br/><b>The Game</b><br/><br/>Everyone picked characters first off.  Everyone had played SotC or had read the book, so this went fairly quick. The characters were:<br/>Max Richards - Martian war veteran, hot shot charmer.<br/>Sylvia Fiore - The eagle eyed rocket ship pilot with her own portable rocket pack.<br/>(Pat) "Babe" Jones - A handy engineer after leaving behind his career with the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br/>RUBI - Robotic Universal Brain Instrument, the ship's science officer.<br/>Qua Meesh - A martian who betrayed his people during the war. Like all Martians, he has a widow's peak bowl hair cut, green skin and a tail.<br/>Jamie Jackson - The ever sneaky and troublesome 10 year old stowaway.<br/><br/>We started with everyone writing up their character's novels and passing them around.  Some surprising ones was "Sylvia Bears the First Martian Child" where Qua Meesh helped hide his nephew someplace safe, and "RUBI vs the Martian Atomic Brain" in which RUBI absorbed a martian computer. But they were all excellent, like "Babe Jones vs Doctor Radiation" and "Max Richards Held Captive by Space!" (where he faces off against the Lord of Space), "Jamie Jackson in the Slums of Mars" (Martian Mobsters!) and "Qua Meesh and the Martian Emperor".  <br/><br/>The curtain comes up with the ship struck from the surface. Sylvia guides the ship toward a mudlake.  As everyone else straps in, RUBI goes to the cargo hold to secure the supplies, he discovers Jamie. While trying to help the boy, they get thrown from the rocket and into the lake when they crash, Jamie was just "Where he doesn't belong" and RUBI felt the urge to "Protect the Boy". They got a fate point for putting themselves in peril. Everyone else soon got Fate points for being on a "Rocket Ship Sinking into the Mud" but they were able to get out in time.<br/><br/>Having sighted a settlement from the air, they begin travelling toward it, Sylvia takes to the air to scout ahead. She is struck by an electro-cannon, and knocked out of the sky, she cries out "Help, I'm in trouble!" as martians comes out and take her prisoner.<br/><br/>Max invokes "Slyvia needs me!" in order to double time it to the settlement. However seeing that Sylvia has been taken, he leaves the group to "Blast his way in".  RUBI decodes the martian algorithyms, and Jamie sneaks around to discover where Sylvia is being held, and sees where Max went off to, he's just stumbled into ten martians, with their ray guns ready.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sylvia uses her "charm with aliens" to trick the guard and get out, but not before she discovers that her long lost Martian son is a part of it all!  Max and Jamie take on the martians, while Qua Meesh, RUBI, and Babe pretend to be a prison transfer to get to where Sylvia is. Babe tires of playing prisoner as Qua tries to convince the last guard, and pulls out his Space Wrench to clobber the guards, with RUBI coming in with his metal arms as backup.<br/><br/>Everyone regroups as Max interrogates a prisoner from his fight. Asking The Right Questions, he discovers that this base is the site to rebuild the Martian space fleet with new war rockets, but not only that, but experiments on humans to turn them into martians, rebuilding their forces!  Somehow, in the middle, RUBI and Jamie have disappeared!<br/><br/>The "Martian Atomic Brain" that RUBI had absorbed takes over and he gets his "Protect the Boy" orders confused. It turns out that since Jamie is "Just a kid!" and "Marked by Martians" he'll be the perfect subject to test advancements in the serum that "Dr. Radiation" has developed (but wasn't he human? He's turned himself Martian!).  RUBI is sent away, and then Sylvia's son (you can tell by the hair) comes in and gives Jamie an injection. Now "The Process has begun" and I set out 3 Fate points to count this down.<br/><br/>The others split up to free captured humans and find Jamie. They discover RUBI partially taken apart by some bored guards, but Babe quickly puts him back together. Sylvia and Max figure out how to wake the humans from their sleeping states and release them from the martian machines. Max uses his leadership skills to help them get themselves someplace safe. The others make it to Jamie in time, but not before something in the drug causes him to go into a Martian War Rage, and he smashes up the lab, including the serum to cure him!<br/><br/>The group heads to the only other lab with the equiment to make a serum, and find Dr. Radiation and Sylvia's son and a whole mess of Martians.  Here, time ran short, so we had to rush through it a bit, but suffice it to say that the good guys won. Max, Babe, and Sylvia beat up various martians, particularly Dr. Radiation and her Martian Child. RUBI got to work on a serum to help Jamie. Jamie disabled martian gun turrets in the room, and Qua Meesh in a valiant self sacrifice took out several martians with his Martian War Song and "Cosmic Mind Link" before falling into, and apparently dying, in a vat of rocket fuel (the player had to leave early, so got a +2 for each remaining Fate point, and a +8 for taking on three consequences and Taken Out in the heroic act).<br/><br/>With a fantastic explosion (that could fit within the budget) the crew survived the defeat of thier enemies and took the human captives home.  In the final shot, we see that Jamie appears to have grown a tiny green tail.<br/><br/><b>The Conclusion</b><br/><br/>Man, what a fantastic time.  Like all the games I played in, all the players here were great.  I had very little idea what could happen going in, outside of the crash landing.  I told them this as well, and let them guide things based on their aspects and what they decided to do.  Likewise, I let the player of Qua Meesh decide what martians looked like, the only limitation was that they be humanoid and fit a 1920's sci-fi budget. I ran this first for some friends, and this came out totally different. I admit, I was a little concerned that I'd be influenced by what I had done before, but everyone had so much energy and ideas that I never even considered falling back on an "old" idea.  The only regret is having to cut the final battle short, and in hindsight, I should have had the players narrate something they do in the finale instead of asking for actions and narrating it myself.  3 stress helps make battles quicker and puts the characters at more risk, but they were still towering pulp heroes. Fate flowed back and forth pretty quickly, and when I saw some people getting low, I just compelled multiple aspects to cause a huge amount of trouble (like Jamie getting injected). But nonetheless, it was a blast.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/steven807" title="steven807"><img alt="steven807" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/steven807">steven807</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135607/#Comment_135607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T20:58:04+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  8:58PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun indeed.
