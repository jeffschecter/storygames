We take excerpts of actual play audio and talk about them, sometimes with insight and other times just to say that "This was awesome!" In our latest episode, taken from games we played at Dexcon 2014 in Morristown NJ in July, you can hear one or both of us play or run Cthulhu Dark, Trail of Cthulhu, Classic Traveller, a Traveller-esque sci-fi game called Singularity, the steampunk Fate Core game I'm working on called "Romance in the Air," the alternate history mash-up game called <b>The New World</b> that I've been working on for a while, and a fantasy heartbreaker where the other players drove Mel away from the table. It's pretty good stuff.<br/><br/><a href="http://virtualplay.libsyn.com/episode-69-dexcon-2014-recap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://virtualplay.libsyn.com/episode-69-dexcon-2014-recap</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
