(p.16)<br/><br/>Basically I'm not 100% clear on what happens if a PC doesn't roll for Dominance. I have a few ideas based on the text; any confirmations would be awesome:<br/><br/>* The Dominance roll is the ticket to entry into the Encounter. No Dominance roll, no Encounter for that PC. This seems supported by the text.<br/><br/>* Every Trooper in an Encounter must pass a Dominance roll (and the AA roll must fail) for the PCs to get an Ambush. So if there's a trooper present in the Encounter but the player doesn't roll Dominance, the players by definition can't fulfill the requirement (i.e. the high roller could still set range and the non-roller could be in the Encounter, but there will not be an Ambush)<br/><br/>* Only players who rolled Dominance will qualify for an Ambush. Non-rollers will be in the Encounter but will not get to Ambush -- this also means they're not risking breaking the "every trooper" rule. This interpretation seems the dodgiest, but it's how we were playing the other night. It seemed like an interesting decision to make at the time: miss the Ambush but help ensure that the rollers would do well against the bugs.<br/><br/>There are probably other ways to read it, and it probably doesn't require much discussion.

I mean, there's this whole fiction thing going on when we play an RPG, to suggest that it should have no bearing/impact on the mechanics seems a little odd. If all the players describe their characters as being intentionally oblivious to their surroundings, it doesn't seem like a stretch that when an encounter happens, they'll be surprised. That doesn't seem like fiat, that seems more like just applying weight to the fiction that we're all collaboratively creating.<br/><br/>Would I just drop it on them like some kind of jerk? No. I'd tell them, "hey, if none of you are looking out for Aliens, I'm just going to Ambush you." Then they can informatively decide what they want their characters to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168092/#Comment_168092" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T17:08:52+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  5:08PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay...if the first sentence of the Dominance rules (p16) is taken literally -- that an Encounter <i>by definition</i> is started with an NFA roll -- that totally and completely takes care of my question.

Like, utterly at a loss to explain to you in any words clearer than I wrote in the book.<br/><br/>The book is not written as a sequence of GO TO, GO SUB, RETURN, and LOOP commands. It just isn't. This is not C++ or FORTRAN or something, it's in English.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;What is the meaning of the line "the opportunity to make an assault themselves"?<br/>The meaning is "the opportunity to make an assault themselves", which after some head-scratching I could rephrase for you as "the chance to try for an ambush themselves".<br/><br/>Anyone rolling NFA is looking out to see (a) that they're not ambushed and (b) if there is an opportunity for making an ambush themselves.<br/><br/>Formally, an Encounter begins when the GM throws down some Threat Tokens and there is a Dominance roll. If all the players decline to roll then the GM rolls and sees if it's an Ambush (if the aliens win) or the two sides stagger into each other at Far Range (if the aliens fail, since they are the only ones rolling in this case).<br/><br/>If, in the fiction, the group is having an argument over where to bury the dead Lieutenant and his entourage, say, when the GM throws down his Threat Tokens, and none of them want to roll NFA then it would probably make sense if the GM said "um, your asses are ambushed". The group might totally buy that, after all the GM asked if you wanted to roll for Dominance, this wasn't a "surprise! fuck you!" GM move.<br/><br/>If the group cried foul then the GM can always roll the AA, and if no player wants to roll NFA then the PCs have no successes. Fail means "lack of success". I mean, if your house is on fire and you decline to try and put the fire out then you can't say "well, I never failed my Use Fire Extinguisher roll so the house isn't a charred stump -- it's only a charred stump if I *fail* my Use Fire Extinguisher roll". Right?<br/><br/>Sometimes every PC rolls their NFA and they almost get an Ambush, but Trooper Bloggs fails when everyone else succeeds. Curse Trooper Bloggs! You often find that the next time, no one rolls except the Sarge so as not to fuck up the Ambush attempt. The problem is that if the Sarge then fails you have a huge chance of being Ambushed yourselves. So the more people rolling the better the chance of the PCs setting range and avoiding Ambush, but the lesser chance of causing an Ambush yourselves. And no one can tell a player to roll or not roll. Sure, the Sarge can order Trooper Bloggs not to do _anything_ to fuck it up again, but (enjoyably) the player of Trooper Bloggs might roll when asked for a Dominance test again.<br/><br/>I hope that's clearer for you, Paul. Everyone else in the thread seems to have it bang on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168167/#Comment_168167" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T06:01:49+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  6:01AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to read this as charitably as possible, Gregor, and I hope you'll do the same with me.<br/><br/>I see a few different issues happening at once, which has led to my confusion.<br/><br/>First off, the first sentence under "Dominance" makes it clear that an NFA roll is what starts the Encounter. It's a rule. I didn't read it as such, because, well, it's not really called out as "a rule." It's not in a table or whatever. That's my bad, and that's totally fine by me. <br/><br/>In the very next paragraph, there's a sentence that's not a rule, the thing about "a chance to make an assault." And at this point I'm trying to read it like a rule, so I'm scratching my head wondering, "Huh...I wonder what he means by 'assault'?" Is "assault" an "ambush" or is it "an attack"? How literally am I supposed to read the sentence, "Note that a PC does not have to roll a die if they do not want their PC to be watching out for an incoming attack, or the opportunity to make an assault themselves"? It's full of double-negatives and rulesy-sounding implications to my ears.<br/><br/>It's one sentence in an otherwise lovely book, Gregor. Please don't take this as an attack on your work.<br/><br/>Now, on to the issue of not rolling = failure.<br/><br/>See, if that's your answer, that means that every trooper MUST roll their NFA in order to even qualify for an Ambush -- which is fine. Is that the intent of that rule? The logic is pretty clear:<br/><br/>Every trooper must succeed and the aliens must fail for the PCs to Ambush the aliens. If not rolling = failure, then any trooper who doesn't roll has broken the "every trooper must succeed" rule. Is that how it is read?<br/><br/>(Please, don't fall back on "It's written in English". It's more than a little insulting, and that *is* me reading you charitably.)<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168170/#Comment_168170" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T06:07:22+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  6:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He has a point there, Gregor. <br/><br/>I think you could, based on what Gregor said, safely errata that to be "every Trooper who rolls must succeed and the aliens must fail"<br/><br/>and for the other side: "The aliens must succeed and the Troopers must have no successes"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168204/#Comment_168204" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T08:07:20+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  8:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I am totally on the same page as you with charitable reading and I really appreciate the time you are giving me on this.<br/><br/>I guess my attempt with the sentence/clause ("the opportunity to make an assault themselves") was as follows. I was trying to summarise what your PC would be doing in the "story" as they made their NFA roll. Why are we rolling the dice. Has Sarge got everyone watching the horizon and undergrowth? Is the squad looking out for contact?<br/><br/>So, anyone wanting to make an NFA roll is either alert looking out for ambushes/assaults by the aliens or trying to set one up themselves.<br/><br/>Anyone not choosing to roll is leaving contact up to other people to decide. I imagine they are not looking to set up an Ambush, they're lighting up their cancer sticks and playing with their Mitt and Ball.<br/><br/>And around the table that's what happens, some folks choose not to roll because they don't want to blow it for everyone, or because their Rep is that they don't give a rat's ass about when and where they meet the bugs. They leave it up to everyone else.<br/><br/>Others, meanwhile, will choose to roll to make sure the party doesn't get hosed by an alien ambush. And when one of them blows it I'm sure to describe them standing on a twig or whatever to alert the aliens.<br/><br/>Having thought hard about it would "the opportunity to set up an ambush themselves" be any better? I guess I was using "assault" rather than "ambush" to make it a more interesting read.<br/><br/>The encounter is going to happen, that much is sure when the GM allocates Threat Tokens to it. Dominance is really you finding out who wins the test to decide the range at which contact is made. In exceptional circumstances you'll get an Ambush. Those circumstances become less rare if the players start to try to set up Ambushes themselves, that's part of the game, it's a little bit tactical and I like having it in there.<br/><br/>Oh, and apologies if I caused any offence about saying it is written in English. What I mean is that I want the book to be readable as a book, not just as a set of procedures like a stack of code or a sequence of instructions on a card or board game. If something I've written to make it more "readable" to me gets in the way of you understanding the procedures then that's my bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168206/#Comment_168206" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T08:08:26+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  8:08AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>He has a point there, Gregor.<br/><br/>I think you could, based on what Gregor said, safely errata that to be "every Trooper who rolls must succeed and the aliens must fail"<br/><br/>and for the other side: "The aliens must succeed and the Troopers must have no successes"</blockquote>\nYes, Lance.

Particularly when I'm first reading/learning/internalizing a game, I'm studying the text with Talmudic intensity. I don't want some nuance or implication to slip by! <br/><br/>Maybe another way of asking my question would be, What does not rolling for Dominance look like in the game fiction? I think I get this from the text: it looks like the character either isn't on lookout or isn't going to make an assault. Ahh...but it's looking at the game fiction -- <i>letting the fiction dictate</i>, as it were -- that leads me to wondering about the in-game status of non-rollers. Is the mechanic's result being posthumously described by the fiction, or is the fiction requiring that a mechanic be used in a certain way?<br/><br/>In any case, I'm satisfied with the state of things now:<br/><br/>* At least one PC must roll at the start of the encounter<br/>* Only PCs who roll can "succeed" or "fail" at the Dominance roll<br/><br/>Thanks for your time, and thanks for a fun game.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168235/#Comment_168235" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T09:09:26+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  9:09AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Paul.
