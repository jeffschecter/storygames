As his minions, you're forced to try to execute Dr Oserlinde\u2019s evil schemes, all the while struggling with whether you can escape his grip or if it\u2019s just easier to give in and obey. <br/></i></blockquote>\nMy aim with this scenario is give some strong guidance about how to play a game of My Life with Master in a 3-4 hour time slot while still creating a satisfying experience. The scenario is about 40 pages long, and is an expansion of a sales demo that Paul ran at GenCon in 2003. It contains advice on:<br/><br/>\u2022\tpitching the game <br/>\u2022\tpreparing to run it<br/>\u2022\tintroducing the potentially difficult subject matter at the heart of the game<br/>\u2022\trunning the game, including how to interweave scenes between minions<br/>\u2022\tensuring the endgame maintains interest and momentum.<br/><br/>What I\u2019d like to do now is get <b>two to four external playtesters who will run this at some point over the next four months</b>. You\u2019re my ideal playtester-audience if any of the following apply:<br/><br/>\u2022\tyou\u2019ve always wanted to run My Life with Master but haven\u2019t gotten around to it<br/>\u2022\tyou\u2019re not sure how to run My Life with Master<br/>\u2022\tyou\u2019d appreciate some guidance about running the game at a deeper, non-comedic level<br/><br/>Rather than post the full scenario online, I'd like to email it to those who're committed to running it. If you\u2019re interested, <b>whisper me with your email</b> and I'll send you the .pdf.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384603/#Comment_384603" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T08:37:19+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  8:37AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            40 pages long, that's longer than the rule book!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384675/#Comment_384675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T05:22:03+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  5:22AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not quite, GMSkarka!

I dashed off a reply without double-checking your name.<br/><br/>By \u2018winning\u2019, I\u2019m taking you to mean a player who tries to maneuver their minion towards a particular endgame condition. This can turn the game into a mechanical exercise for them, rather than one in which they engage with the situation.<br/><br/>My solution is entirely practical (but I need to test whether it works for people who aren\u2019t me). I\u2019ve re-written the character sheets and removed the endgame conditions from them. Instead, the sheets contain seven bits of player advice, compiled between myself, Paul and Michael S. Miller. This advice includes stuff like:<br/><br/>1.\tYour character cannot die (at least until the very end of the game). No matter how safely or sensibly you play, your minion\u2019s life expectancy is the length of this game. Make it three hours worth living!<br/>2.\tExplore the reasons why you believe your minion can't leave Dr Oserlinde. Find your weaknesses.<br/>3.\tDon't be afraid to be a monster, and don't shy away from doing monstrous things<br/>\u2026<br/>6.\tIf you feel the GM is focusing on one minion\u2019s story too much, ask for Dr Oserlinde\u2019s attention, or enter that minion\u2019s scene while they\u2019re on a mission from Dr Oserlinde.<br/><br/>Once the endgame is triggered I then hand out a card to each player: this card has all the endgame conditions on it, and I explain how they can adjust the scores from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384780/#Comment_384780" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T19:25:13+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  7:25PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I've found is some players contrive to make every scene possible one in which a connection is made.
