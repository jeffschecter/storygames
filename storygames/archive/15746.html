I've decided to hack it to run in Dungeon World. I've got the first adventure ready to roll but I'm going to wait till I have playtested it before I release it into the wilds.\xa0<br/><br/>I'm planning on running a game of it over skype either this week or next and I've already got two players interested. I'm going to be running it pretty RaR from the basic PDF but I'll entertain other classes if you can point me to them.\xa0<br/><br/>Reply here, send me a message or email me at josh dot mannon on google if your interested in playing.\xa0                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357213/#Comment_357213" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T14:25:50+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  2:25PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2012 2:27PM by Felan.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be interested to hear how it goes, and how you find the process of adapting a longer series of adventures - the Paizo adventure paths are pretty linear, but DW is by nature pretty non-linear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357221/#Comment_357221" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T15:07:12+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  3:07PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to go adventure by adventure and try and make sure that each one works as a stand alone.

I had two players who had expressed interest on the local Meetup group and while I was setting up and waiting on them I noticed that there was a woman I recognized from D&amp;D Encounters wandering around while her husband was battling with minis so I invited her to join in. Once everyone was there I did a quick rundown of the rules (I need to get better at that) and passed around the playbooks.\xa0<br/><br/>The party ended up consisting of Hawke the Fighter, Wesley the Cleric, and Shank the Thief. It seemed like a pretty well rounded group though no one took any of the newer classes. Character creation took barely any time at all and we were off.\xa0<br/><br/>I wrote out some specific questions for the players to answer about their characters and I took their answers for opportunities on down the road and some managed to work in during the first session. I think I need to rework the questions I ask the group and I need to add a few more individual questions but over all they worked out well, filled in a bit of backstory.\xa0<br/><br/>While they were creating characters and answering questions, I drew a picture of the opening to the cairn and a pair of evil looking eyes peering out. When they were done, I laid the paper out and told them that as the approached the cairn they could see the eyes and hear growling coming from the cave. I hit them all with, "What do you do?" in turn and they all came back with drawing weapons and waiting as each failure to act brought on more wolves, getting surrounded and eventually attacked. I took my time and announced a lot of future badness hoping I wouldn't have to break the stalemate but eventually I did.\xa0<br/><br/>The wolf attack almost ended it all. I was using variable damage but it hardly mattered. Thinking back on it I should have really should have used my wolves other moves more, tripping the PCs up or dragging them off but I did decide to announce some future badness by having one of the wolves run off howling to the sound of other wolves off in the distance.\xa0<br/><br/>The party was pretty darn near dead (I need to re-examine the wolves and see if they really should have been as dangerous and tenacious as they were) so the retreated to an abandoned shack nearby to make camp. Hawke spent the evening skinning the wolves and prepping their pelts. Wesley handed out some healing before they went down for the night and all but Hawke were at full health the next morning.\xa0<br/><br/>They approached the cave more cautiously the next day but there were no wolves to greet them only the things they left behind. Wesley found himself a shield and a large, blue, crystal lantern in the wolves den. When they decided to light it, light also appeared far down the corridor.\xa0<br/><br/>They investigated the light and found a burial chamber. Within the chamber were five other lanterns of different colors on long chains. The sarcophagus in the center held both the hints they needed to solve the puzzle of the room as well as a trap, both of which they managed to roll to find out.\xa0<br/><br/>They didn't bite on some of the clues but rather decided to investigate the strange death of a boy who's body they discovered in the chamber. Their investigation lead them to climb one of the chains and discover a hidden passageway with a wind trap that through poor Wesley to the floor of the chamber below. But triggering the trap did convince them that they needed to solve the puzzle before they went on. They finally made the connection between two of the clues and started rotating the sarcophagus which led to an elevator of sorts showing up.\xa0<br/><br/>The elevator took them to a lower level where most of the level was under water. Ever brave Wesley dove in to see what he could see while the other two checked the body they had found at the edge of the water. While Wesley was trying to return with some loot he had found he was attacked by a vengeful ghost that once belonged in the body his party mates were looting. Wesley managed to break off the attack and get some air but the ghost was right on him.\xa0<br/><br/>Shank and Hawke spent a little while being fairly ineffective but finally landed a blow getting the ghost off of Wesley. Once Wesley was free he destroyed the ghost with one blow of his mighty mace.\xa0<br/><br/>With the ghost vanquished the party searched the rest of the submerged chambers and found the last missing lantern. With that they returned and lit it a pillar of air lifted them into the trapped hallway where they could clearly tell that the trap was disarmed.
