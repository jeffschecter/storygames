Actually, it began as a GM-less hack of Ethan Greer's <a href="http://www.simplephrase.com/gaming.html" rel="nofollow">Thugs &amp; Thieves</a>.<br/>In this game, players sort of take turns refereeing a "quest" for a bunch of other players who are playing adventurers. Both dice and playing cards are used. You roll dice to do run-of-the-mill "PC" things, such as battling the challenge in front of you, but you turn to cards to do the "GM-ish" things, such as introducing a NPC opponent into the fiction, placing a magical treasure or revealing an alternate route toward the end goal (bypassing a danger).<br/><br/>Now, Aces and "face" cards have a variety of functions in the game, also depending on their suit... while "suit" cards (2s through 10s) are to represent the <b>challenges </b>in the quests. My idea being that the refereeing player plays a card and briefly describes a scene where a "challenge" is met by the heroes (usually some sort of obstacle on their path: a roaring river, a walled fortress, a dangerous beast, a treacherous forest, an army of enemies, or a seductive rogue-sorceress set on duping them, doping them and killing them in their sleep). During or after this description, the referee also explicitly or implicitly sets a conflict arena, declaring which character Ability the PCs are supposed to test in order to succesfully "beat" the challenge; other players are allowed to ignore this "suggested" Ability, though, thus proposing a different solution (subject to group approval) and testing a different Ability, albeit at a reduced success rate.<br/><br/>Cards should "represent" the challenges, their values implying "dangerousness" and difficulty, dictating how many "successful" rolls one needs to get on the dice to "pass" the challenge. 10s are extra-hard challenges, 4s are the least dangerous challenges, while 2s and 3s are reserved for "minor complication" that can be "piled up" on any 4 or higher to make the challenge more perilous (such as: adding treacherous marshy terrain to a battle, adding an angry constrictor snake to a dangerous rickety bridge traversal, etc.)<br/><b>The suit of the card </b>(hearts, spades, diamonds or clubs) <b>should instead dictate a "theme" or "flavour" for the challenge! </b>And this is what I need help with.<br/><br/>Would you help me run through "typical" challenges and dangers for Conan-esque swords &amp; sorcery (both the R.E.Howard Conan and the filmic Conan, actually, plus derivatives of both), sorting them into 4 major abstract "categories", and link those categories to the four suits?<br/>I'm also thinking of assigning "default suggested Abilities" to each of the suits (but creative uses of character Abilities will still trump those).<br/>Ah... major adversarial NPCs need specifically <i><b>not </b></i>be covered, while lesser fights (with wild beasts, bunches of thugs...) do.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193336/#Comment_193336" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T18:34:06+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  6:34PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu, you might want to look at my implementation of a very similar thing to mine for ideas: <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Errantry.pdf" rel="nofollow">Errantry</a>. It's an attempt at GM-less Solar System, with cards to generate challenges (including completely statted NPCs).<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, Conan faces physical foes without much intelligence but with considerable wild fury (Clubs), magical foes (Diamonds perhaps), complications from people weaker than he who appeal to his better nature or attempt to seduce him from his quest (Hearts), and... um. Not sure what the fourth one would be, sorry. Maybe other brave fighters who are worthy opponents (Spades)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193354/#Comment_193354" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T21:12:45+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  9:12PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out In a Wicked Age and it's Oracles, which are based on cards.

Slightly off-topic, but since I also <i>love </i>its subject-matter I'm sure as hell going to print it out for a more thorough reading, and likely play a game of it not-so-far in the future. For my own design, though, I'm looking toward a quicker, more streamlined style of "challenge generation" by cards.<br/>Your 4-way categorization of Conan-esque challenges really put my creative juices into motion. Thank you.<br/><br/><br/>@ Alan:<br/><br/>I'm familiar with IAWA, but I was never able to see the Oracle entries as somehow "simbolically related" to the cards or suits they're tied to... Those tables look very much like a "roll 1d100" thing to me.<br/>The Conan Oracles thread you started, however, is <b>great</b>. I'm halfway through reading it, and I'm feeling both a strong urge to play IAWA again and a strong urge to go re-read Conan stories... hmmm...<br/><br/><br/>@ Roger:<br/><br/>Your "arbitrary stab" at it is indeed useful to me. I like how it resounds with what Mike wrote, BTW.<br/><br/><br/>@ everybody:<br/><br/>I now have a half-formed idea brewing, but please keep those coming. Thank you for your help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
