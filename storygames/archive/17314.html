I tend to like a fairytale setting but I've also enjoyed games based on The Phantom of the Opera and the Great Depression.<br/><br/> - Tell the players in advance that you are not their friend in this game, that you are out to get them and to make their characters' lives hell, so to that extent, you aren't going to play fair.<br/><br/> - Encourage starting values of Reason: 5 and Fear: 3 and let every character start with 2 Love, invested in one or two NPCs. Take a moment to think about how each of those NPCs could be standing in the Master's way: do they have something he wants? Are they a potential rival? Are they fighting him?<br/><br/> - Create a ring of orders in the first round of play: give Minion A an order that targets a connection of Minion B, then Minion B targets a connection of Minion C and so on, until the last minion targets one of Minion A's connections.<br/><br/> - Encourage 'task chains', that is, whenever a Minion tries to do something, the NPC they're trying to get it from will only give it to them if they first... There is great fun to be had watching a Minion make more and more promises brought about by their desire to earn the Sincerity dice on their roll; as Master, you can pretty much sit back and watch them dig their own graves (bonus points if you can literally get a Minion to do this.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392527/#Comment_392527" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T06:44:51+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  6:44AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://ipressgames.com/manifesto.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ipressgames.com/manifesto.html</a> is fantastic and one of the high water marks of game advice.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/harleqwn" title="harleqwn"><img alt="harleqwn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/harleqwn">harleqwn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392618/#Comment_392618" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T08:55:37+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  8:55AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you both for the advice.  :-)<br/><br/>-David-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392622/#Comment_392622" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T10:14:22+00:00" title="October  7, 2012 10:14AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know.  I ran it back in playtesting days using the default Gothic setting, and it was one of the most intense games I've ever experienced.  Really went off the track, which is even more remarkable considering I misread how to implement the die mechanic, so all our rolls were completely out of line with the rules.<br/><br/>I don't know that I'd say you as GM is in opposition, merely that as the Master, you will torment the characters by pushing their buttons.  Then do it.  I basically started by putting their Beloveds in jeopardy right from the start and I never let up.  Every scene change revolved around either the Master commanding the character to do something distasteful or to do something that directly threatened a Love.  Even better when the Master uses other characters to target a particular character's Beloved, or sends them as a group.  Lovely, lovely conflict.<br/><br/>And keep in mind their chosen Strengths and Flaws, because mmmph, yeah, such delicious leverage.  Be ready to jump on the Flaws when they crop up--and they will, oh yes, they will.  Make the minions wince and cringe and grovel like the inferior, MISBEGOTTEN WORMS THEY <i>ARE</i>...!

Let the players know at the start of the game that your job is to play the Master they create with full force, and that if their creation suggests certain themes, you'll go there, and hard. Make sure they understand what they're asking you to do. I always tell the players in a one-shot that we'll accelerate play (and cheat if necessary) to make sure that the End Game happens, because the Master has to die.

Like the OP I want to ideally play a few games before running it myself. I've heard that you've run it a fair bit in the past; for the benefit of the other Brits on this forum, do you intend running it again soon?

The plot still needs to be approved by MUSH staff, and might get denied since it makes use of non-WoD rules, but I'm feeling optimistic.  This will be my first time playing -or- running the game, so I'm preparing myself to take on any pitfalls we come to.  Whenever it happens (hopefully within the next week or two), I'll either link to the pose-only logs on the MUSH's wiki or else paste them unedited here if the player gives me permission.  You might be able to tease out some pitfalls and perks of however I end up running it.<br/><br/>Because it -is- for a WoD game, though, I had to figure out a way to make WoD rolls matter in every scene.  After some dead-end simulations using the MLwM rolls as bonuses to WoD rolls, I decided instead to do it as follows.  Rather than do one roll per scene, I'll make it two rolls per scene -- a WoD roll for the scene's turning point and a MLwM roll for the scene's climax.  This might make the scenes a little longer than is usual for MLwM, but I sort of expect that anyway just because MUSH culture doesn't tend to focus on tight scenes so much.  I'll try to mitigate that with aggressive framing at the beginning and ends of the scenes and reminders that we can fastforward whenever we want.  The WoD roll will essentially be an opportunity to twist the scene's theme.  For instance, if the Master orders the minion to do something that seems villainous, the minion's choices and actions regarding -how- to follow the order (with success determined by an appropriate WoD roll) may shift the climax of the scene either towards Overture or towards Violence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393530/#Comment_393530" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-16T04:00:27+00:00" title="October 16, 2012  4:00AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, a WoD hack of MLWM- hard trad meets dirty hippie indie...

It seems like the most significant choices are made very early on, largely by the stats chosen at the start of the game, and that afterward it is really difficult to affect a change in trajectories, either by the GM or by the protagonist.  Doing so would require really manhandling the sorts of scenes that are played, rather than playing them out as seems naturally fitting to the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393596/#Comment_393596" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-16T14:42:31+00:00" title="October 16, 2012  2:42PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you will find it's difficult at all.

I mean, yeah, rising stats do tend to bring you towards different epilogues.  But especially with the touted starting stats of Reason 5, Fear 3, and my protagonist's chosen stats of Weariness 1, Self-Loathing 2, the rise of self-loathing and love seemed to overcome that of weariness.  A high self-loathing meant more chance to succeed on violence and villainy, which meant more self-loathing, which meant an even better chance of success on violence and villainy, etc.  And by the time the endgame is reached, weariness is still so low that a) there is much less chance of failure and b) even on failure the rise of weariness doesn't nearly catch up with the other stats.<br/><br/>There was also a problem in that self-loathing rose so easily and in such an accelerated fashion that in order to give the minion a fair chance at the positive outcome, I'd have to hand out overtures right and left, which is fine, except that it was making the game more about what scenes i allowed than how the story actually played out.  In addition, the Horror Revealed scene only comes about if self-loathing overtakes love and reason.  With a high reason, that means it only comes about when self-loathing is already so high that a negative epilogue is practically assured.<br/><br/>That said, it seems to be working better now that I've got it set at Fear 3, Reason 3, in addition to the protagonist's choices having more influence over what gets rolled at the end of the scene.  But I don't know if those are really the -optimal- starting stats, or if they are just much better than Fear 3, Reason 5.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393603/#Comment_393603" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-16T15:12:34+00:00" title="October 16, 2012  3:12PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, also, with starting stats of Fear 3, Reason 3, Weariness 1, Self-Loathing 2, I've encountered on odd situation.  It is possible to trigger the endgame and kill the master without achieving <i>any</i> of the epilogues.<br/><br/>It happens when you get 2 violence successes, 2 violence failures, and 8 overture successes to trigger the endgame, then 3 failures in the endgame roll, and then finally a success on the endgame roll.<br/><br/>You end the game with Fear 3, Reason 3, Self-Loathing 4, Weariness 7, Love 8, which seems to satisfy none of the epilogue conditions.

Some minions are hell-bent at overturning the master, and they fall in to other endings naturally.<br/><br/>The game really hits a good spot when you have around four minions, so that a lot of variety can come out of the strategy and endgame conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393624/#Comment_393624" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-16T17:02:31+00:00" title="October 16, 2012  5:02PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you referring to Capture and Horror Revealed?

[The strange spelling is there to help me think about the mutants as former human subjects or freaks rather than comic book heroes.]<br/><br/>Setting: Early 1980s, located in the very northeast corner of Westchester County, Salem Center, New York., USA.<br/><br/>The Master - Professor Charles Exxavier: Teacher and Collector of mutants worldwide using his Ex-Mansion as a base of operations and museum for his mutants.<br/><br/>Charles is obsessed with hoarding mutants from around the world. He is convinced that through his mutation (of which there is no proof) of telepathy, that the world is out to get his precious mutants -- to exploit them in inconceivable and dubious ways. His greatest perceived opponent comes from his rival Erik Lensherr (an Outsider), a competitor from a local chess club called the Brotherhood. Charles believes that Erik is a grand schemer (based on Erik's performace in chess) who is orchestrating his own mutant arms race that will push the world to harm mutants. Charles sees himself as the one and only person capable of saving the deranged and asocial creatures of the world from other misguided mutants and the uncaring world out to get them.<br/><br/><br/>The Minions<br/><br/>Cyclops: This introspective young man focuses too much on observing the world rather than living in it that he can look through and within other places. This has the unfortunate side effect of shocking people away from him who cannot cope with the stare. As a result of the intense concentration he bleeds through the pores of his hands unless distracted by girls.<br/>More Than Human: Piercing creepy stare through anything, except reflective surfaces.<br/>Less Than Human: Leaves a ruby red stain on everything touched with his hands except when around girls.<br/><br/>Marvel Girl: Marvel Girl is so adept at deciphering details about people that she can, and often does, blather on about the details of others to all who will listen. Those who flee, do so quickly, dropping or knocking over things. Unfortunately, Marvel Girl cannot resist putting things back where they belong, which can result in exhaustive chases or hours spent diverted from primary tasks unless bound or held by rope, hands, furniture, etc.<br/>More Than Human: Can read people like a book, but only between dusk to dawn.<br/>Less Than Human: Compulsive need to put things where they belong, unless restrained.<br/><br/>Beast: Beast is a man on the move, flipping, tumbling, cartwheeling around the Ex-Mansion and city performing tasks for his Master and not daring to venture in the wilds of the rural countryside. Unfortunately, Beast's communication abilities are blessed and cursed with a multitude of animal languages, of which only become human with the application of alcohol.<br/>More Than Human: An acrobatic wonder, in urban environments.<br/>Less Than Human: Communicates only in non-human animal tongues, except when imbibing alcohol.<br/><br/>Angel: Angel has the very unusual ability to fly with the freedom of the birds. However, he must maintain the spirit of freedom with soul quenching church hymns acquired from this and that place of worship. And with maintaining his fuel for flight, Angel must also take care of his feathery wings to prevent the parasites and dust from making them useless, though time spent investing in the nest will trump the instinct for safety every time.<br/>More Than Human: Can fly through the air on wings, but must sing church hymns while flying.<br/>Less Than Human: Must preen wings that carry dust and parasites at least twice a day except when stealing materials for your nest.<br/><br/>Iceman: Found and thawed for general use by the Master, Iceman has proven more practical in application than imagined -- in the infirmary, the dessert parlor, near the window in summertime vs. those dreadful hot and humid days. However, Iceman does have his primal origins to battle and it would seem that only Tea Time has proven effective in shaping Iceman into the model Minion.<br/>More Than Human: Cool breath and cold hands and feet can startle anyone and quickly heal bruises, except when clothing is applied.<br/>Less Than Human: A neanderthal in appearance and appetites except during Tea Time when manners are expected.<br/><br/>Note: My idea for the Minions is that they could have specific descriptions and more than/less than traits defined for the sake of the pregenerated characters, however, I think that it would be more fun to keep the default starting X-Men and have the Players come up with their own interpretations.<br/><br/><br/>The Innocents<br/><br/>Cain Marko: Step-brother and financial caretaker of Charles' estate with firm resolve that pushes Charles baseless accusations asside -- a Juggernaut.<br/><br/>Raven Darkholme: Adminitrator of estate, nurse, cook, driver? She takes on many roles and keeps the day-to-day operations of the Ex-Manion moving along -- a Mystique.<br/><br/><br/>Townsfolk<br/><br/>The general populace of Salem Center, local law, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409534/#Comment_409534" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T19:36:01+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  7:36PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2013 7:36PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to interject that I think it's pretty important to the game that the players and the GM make the Master together instead of the GM showing up with a scenario.<br/><br/>It leads to a lot more buy-in on horror because the players picked something that interested them.

Maybe it's just me, but 99% of all Masters that people create at my tables are intellectual collector or creator types. All that is important is that the players can really get behind hating the villain.<br/><br/>What is more important than anything else is having a reason that your minion has to obey the Master. You need that bond of codependency or it all falls apart. Really, it ought to have been part of character creation in the rules. "Why can't you just leave? Why do you do what the Master tells you?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
