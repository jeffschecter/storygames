I'm not sold that you've demonstrated "it's about deprotagonisation", but there's definitely some modification of the numbers in your example (or maybe they work as-is!) that demonstrates it's <i>not</i> about you getting screwed <i>as measured by expected resource loss</i>.<br/><br/>Or maybe not. If that 50% varies based on the character's Parrying Ambushes skill, I expect very different reactions, even if every player happens to have built their character with the same Parrying Ambushes number.

By having a player insist (if the player can insist) on being able to talk the Duke into something stupid when the Duke just caught him In flagrante delicto in a game that's supposed to have a more serious tone... well, that could be an unfair rules lawyering in some social contracts.

There's a very slippery slope of acceptable probabilities, and these in turn are also affected by potential spend-a-drama-die mechanics that allow me to choose to skew those probabilities further.  As GB Steve points out, this is definitely a slippery slope, and some folks will balk at 30% while others will only balk when it hits 5% (natural 20); however, it's also contextual, and that context is defined by the play group, as Zak points out.  It is <em>also</em> determined by genre and mood, though: I'll accept much less character effectiveness in, say, a Horror game than in a Supers game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205487/#Comment_205487" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T16:41:08+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  4:41PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 4:42PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak Arntson</cite>The judgement of fairness lies with the group, influenced by the game.

Sometimes being fair kills the game.  The metaphor I use is algebra. You did learn life lessons in algebra, didn't you? You learned that when you made a tiny, insignificant error on line 2, your hard work and diligence would lead you inexorably to an answer that was completely wrong twenty perfectly executed pages later.  That is not fair.  That is not fair at all.

GM saying you're scared if system/table says Player decides that is a theft of the Player's authority.  Includes actual cheating.  We can all view some rule systems as inherently unfair in this way (e.g., someone may regard any system that mechanically determines a PC's emotional responses as unfair) and simply avoid those systems for that reason.<br/><br/>Deceiving others in the exercise of their authority - not telling others information the game/table would assume they would have ~ that's a way of stealing their authority but it's done via information management rather than just "force".  Since GM's manage information in most systems, it's a GM failing most often.<br/><br/>Unconscionable conduct that simply spoils fun.  Being a jerk, importing out-of-game arguments into game etc., being a prima donna.  Since everyone shows up to have fun, it is unfair to spoil their fun.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205504/#Comment_205504" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T17:36:55+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  5:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 5:38PM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, I guess what I'm really after is weird fair/unfair edge cases.

One of the players pulls out the "Technical Manual" and asks to make a roll to reroute power from the overloading reactor to the weapon systems. The GM gives him a stupidly high target number. As the result of crazy rolling and the wild die, the player <em>succeeds</em>. The GM says it buys time for more NPCs to be evacuated from the ship, and we give the enemy ship a hell of a broadside blast. He also got Starship Repair as a skill at level 1.

So the stormtroopers boarded our ship and demanded her weapon. 6 of them.

Actual outcomes of any meaning in the game must have permitted input from more than one source - otherwise someone is just telling their story and not playing a game.  Just as you need opposition to make accomplishment matter, you need chance to exercise roleplaying (choice/rolls etc.) to make outcomes fair.  "I didn't have a chance to affect the story on a point important to me" is unfair - as long as it's clear the system/table agreed that you were allowed to affect story at that level (e.g., you don't get to affect some things because that's beyond the scope of what your authority in game is about period, the sun still comes up tomorrow).<br/><br/>I think this this then connects to one part of why it's sucky to have to roll stealth 10 times to sneak into castle, with failure = same thing whenever it takes place, just as a fair/fun game must give a chance to influence outcome, exercise choice, "play game" for each 'significant thing', then it's also sucky if it "keeps making you make the same choice, reroll the same roll, when what the significant thing is hasn't changed" because really it's saying "your first choice and roll didn't matter all that much as failing on it and failing on 9th roll are identical in outcome".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205591/#Comment_205591" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T07:36:24+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  7:36AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>If the game calls for a stealth roll every 5 feet, then it may be fair.

There is a huge difference between fair and suck. I think where things blur is when the rules leave it purposefully unclear and then the GM makes one person roll every 5 feet and the other every 50. They often have a good reason, but the reason may also be tied to their desire for you to fail. Or it may be tied to drama. Sometimes what's fair is different from decision to decision and can only be quantified at the end of the game based on everyone's overall satisfaction. Like screwing me now to make me feel more awesome 10 minutes later could work. 2 sessions later probably not. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>So how about this one?<br/><br/>Player 1: Its like... oh shit, remember Mr. GM how in Push they did that thing with the bamboo falling and splintering?<br/>GM: Yea, that was tight.<br/>Player 1: So its totally like that, the bamboo falls and splinters go flying everywhere.<br/>GM: Awesome, you get a 2 dice stunt.<br/>Player 2: Neat. Then on my turn, well... remember how in Seven Samurai he said...<br/>GM: I've never seen Seven Samurai, Kurosawa is overrated.<br/>Player 2: Oh. Well... anyway, there is all this rain pouring down and he's slipping everywhere and I fall ontop of him and we end up trying to shove each other's faces into the mud.<br/>GM: I dunno, I don't see it. No stunt bonus.<br/><br/>Fair?</blockquote>\nI've seen this happen all the time. It's not that different that when someone wants to use their expert computer and research skill to find out something and the GM says they can't for whatever reason and the person is all like, in real life I'm not even an expert and even I can do that! <br/><br/>I like to play modern games and some of my players are computer crackers, others work for the FBI, another is a doctor, another an investigator, another a scientist... the amount of collective knowledge and understanding of the world, especially stuff that is relevant to our games can be overwhelming. Games like you describe above in my experience seem to be very much about playing the GM. As if the GM is the puzzle or adventure to be solved. <br/><br/>Is it fair? I think it depends on the game we're playing and what we've agreed to but I'm tempted to say it isn't fair. Given the diversity of players I play with I try not to force me world view on them. I try to reward general creativity and enthusiasm tempered by the suspension of disbelief of the other players. And then try to coax players into taking risks and explaining failure as still being failure but something that doesn't break their own suspension of disbelief. Maybe this isn't the difference between fair or unfair but a sucky GM vs. a fun GM?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205597/#Comment_205597" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T07:44:37+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  7:44AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John is hitting on a toughie.

In 3:16 I signed up for unavoidable damage on an ambush, so it seems totally fair.

This is a bad idea. This is a stupid, stupid idea. <br><br>....<br><br>Actually, "arbitrary" means "at personal discretion." Its the kind of ruling you get when the judge or arbiter makes a ruling based on personal opinion rather than upon law. In more common parlance it means a decision based on personal idiosyncrasies or whim, rather than upon structured or underlying logic. An aribter is someone you go to because you trust their personal judgment to be fair.<br><br>No, really. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia agrees with me</a> and the net is never wrong. <br><br>....<br><br/>However! That doesn't mean that arbitrary = unfair. It just means that arbitrary = as fair as the person passing the judgment happens to be at the time. Which, very often, can be amazingly fair. More fair to the actual situation, in fact, than a judgment based solely upon systemic logic, as the systemic logic may lack proper context in the human situation at the moment. (Thus the reason that arbitrary decisions are allowed in some legal contexts, despite the law being a big systemic logic pile.) <br/><br/>So there are times where arbitrary decisions can be fair, and times where they can be unfair. But the same can be said of systemic decisions. The big trip up in RPG circles seems to be that some folks feel that one side or the other is either inherently more fair, or at least more fair more often on a regular basis. Thus folks who want systemic logic point to books for "fair" rules, where those who want arbitration point to GMs or the group for "fair" rulings. <br/><br/>And then each side tells the other side it is wrong, Prima facie.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206204/#Comment_206204" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T19:35:46+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  7:35PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most, though probably not all of the unfairness I have encountered in RPG play is in the form of the GM ignoring what is says in the rulebook.

I think what I meant was, that aspect of it is pretty obviously unfair, so we can ignore it.<br/><br/>Stuff that seemed unfair at the time (it's harder to remember borderline fair stuff):<br/><br/>A character is incapable of killing his target by throwing a knife into his skull, in Burning Wheel where damage is usually reasonable.<br/><br/>A character who is more than twice as fast as his target has to rely on attacks of opportunity to hit someone running away from him.  And his target can just turn a corner and disappear because of how turns work.<br/><br/>Player: I break the door down my with sword, I roll a 20!<br/>GM: Your sword is stuck in the door.<br/><br/>Player: I sneak in the window.<br/>GM: OK, there's a magical trap that's activated by your bootless shoe.<br/>Player: But I'm a spellthief!  I would have noticed that, look at how good my detect magical traps is!<br/>GM: But you didn't say that you were looking for traps.<br/>Player: Fine, but if I had looked I would have found them ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9281/things-which-are-inherently-unfair" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9281/things-which-are-inherently-unfair" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9281/things-which-are-inherently-unfair/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9281%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9281%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
