This does not mean that verisimiltude is not a concern; you can only act within the constraints of the genre you've chosen for the game. Within those constraints, however, your task is to concoct the necessary time-skips, coincidences and character-centered developments that ensure that each scene you play has a function as regards the dramatic goals of the game instead of being merely a logical chronological follow-up from the next scene.<br/><br/>Another generic advice is that your task in GMing the game is to challenge the identity of each player character, and thus allow the players to further define what their characters are about. The Keys are part of this, but the rest of the crunch also has a part to play: you should push character development options tied to the setting onto the players, not allowing them to stay in the comfort zone of improving their to-hit values incessantly. In the case of colonization scifi it's pretty obvious how you could infect player characters with something that gives them super powers or a telepathic contact with a planetary mind, for example; or you could introduce a local alien species that accepts a specific characters as one of their own after he does a good deed, enabling the character to learn the alien wisdom; or there could be social movements among the settlers, something that requires player characters to take a stand for or against them. Whatever you choose, the point is to engage the players with the crunch landscape and challenge their notions of what their characters are "about".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264319/#Comment_264319" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T06:13:13+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  6:13AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've found to be really helpful is:<br/><br/>1) Follow Eero's advice. He's played this game A LOT.<br/><br/>2) Ask each player to connect or relate each one of his or her Keys to something in the setting. Like, "You have the Key of the Coward? What's something really cowardly you've done?" Or maybe, "Who's one person/one thing your character is really afraid of?" If that doesn't go anywhere, try the opposite tack: "Oh, so you used to be brave. Is there something really brave you did that backfired on you, which is why you now have this Key?"<br/><br/>With each Key connected to some bit of the fiction, I usually have enough to come up with some great stuff to throw at the players. There's almost no prep to do at all as a GM, once you have that.<br/><br/>Before play or between sessions, I look over all the Keys the PCs have, and then pick random combinations. Usually, one Key from one character combined with one Key from another character. About half of the possible combinations will give me some great idea for a "Bang"-type scene or story element I can throw at the players. Just take the two "things" they've told you are linked to their Keys, and out them in a scene together, then add an event that ties it all together, making it relevant to both those Keys, and you instantly have a great scene that presents the players with interesting choices.<br/><br/>Two or three of these are enough for a great session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264320/#Comment_264320" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T06:13:23+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  6:13AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More practically, jot down all the Keys currently in play and make a point of presenting situations that hit them, challenge them, cause them to be re-assessed whenever you can.

The player option to do this is a safeguard against summary injustice (dramatic injustice, I mean), not a routine strategic tool you invoke over any and all conflicts you lose. Only do it when you yourself care about the outcome.<br/><br/>A related bit of advice is that the SG should make sure that the players understand the extended conflict procedure, and especially that the take goal-setting and giving in seriously. The options of changing your goals and giving in are the negotiation element of the system, but it'll never get used if the players are used to game mechanics being no-choice grinds where their only job is to roll the dice and see who's hit points drop to zero first. The SG has the task of shaking the players out of this mind-set by suggesting and advocating for non-extreme conflict participation: suggest giving up when a player character isn't doing too well, and give up yourself when a NPC is losing; also tell the player straight out that your NPC would give up at this particular point if only the PC's goal weren't totally unreasonable and unfair - in time you'll teach the players to not only set reasonable conflict goals that achieve what they're trying to do with minimum resistance, but they'll also learn to appreciate your similar efforts which allow them to give up when they're doing badly at the dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264324/#Comment_264324" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T07:39:08+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  7:39AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2010 7:47AM by Cedric P.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, I am also starting a Solar System campaign with some similar themes (colonization &amp; a new planet).<br/>(I will post a AP of our first session this week to ask some questions of my own)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264336/#Comment_264336" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T08:55:40+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  8:55AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that's what I forgot to mention: Cedric has an interesting thread on his space opera game <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=29512.msg275154" rel="nofollow">here at the Forge</a> - check it out, might have some good ideas on the crunch particulars for a lightly geared start-up.<br/><br/>Also, Cedric: do report back on your game, I've been meaning to ask you whether you're getting SS to work to your spec.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell" title="noahtrammell"><img alt="noahtrammell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell">noahtrammell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264620/#Comment_264620" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T04:57:34+00:00" title="March 31, 2010  4:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

When using them with two characters participating in the situation, consider both Ability checks separately and not their difference or anything like that.<br/><br/>Note that the "you" does the twisting matters. The guy who does the conflict narration is the one who should worry about twisting the results if they feel like it. As I suggest around those same pages, the narration should not be a tense matter of negotiation and well-defined spheres of influence; somebody's putting too much stakes-like matter into their narration if the other players feel the need to complain about it. The player who should chair the after-roll narration is the one who initiated the dicing, which is usually the SG. Everybody can participate in the narration, but nobody should try to be controversial with the narration; the buck stops with one player to make the procedure flow fast, because it's not intended to be important in terms of stakes-resolution. The dice roll already resolved the stakes, the narration is there to allow the players to appreciate the proceeding fiction.<br/><br/>Did you have trouble with conflict narration because players tried to narrate things too aggressively, or were you just confused by the procedure? If it's the former, keep a tighter rein on it as the SG and don't let players abuse the process - make it clear to them that they're not supposed to be partisan about participating in conflict resolution; the choices their characters make are partisan, not how they participate in the mechanics as a player. If it's the latter, remember that those conflict narration details are not normative, but rather just suggestive.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cedric P</cite>A second question: I find it hard to decide when to put Instinct or Reason Harm in my stakes.<br/>Do you often underline a stake with Harm? Should it be common?</blockquote>\nAs Jason says, Harm should be relatively common. It should definitely be more common than it usually is when I play; I have to constantly remind myself to apply it. Basically, it's easy to use too little Harm and thus weaken the game's cycles than it is to apply too much. Just remember that you can only ever suffer one level of Harm per situation, and it's very difficult to put up too much Harm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267095/#Comment_267095" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T10:05:44+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 10:05AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments on the Harm.

If it's the latter, remember that those conflict narration details are not normative, but rather just suggestive.</blockquote>\nThere was no trouble with players trying to over negotiate. <br/>It was more like: "ok cool you win your stakes, so you... Wait, what was you success level? I think I have to add a twist or something... hum let me see..." <br/>It often felt like we had to resolve something two time, a stake and the degree of success. It was like if our success often told us "hey you should alway ask for more!" It was a little confusing because when we negotiate our stakes, we already ask for what we want.<br/><br/>Also, we were often eager to narrate our stakes, so maybe sometime the "wait we have to add something" broke our momentum, but it was still ok.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267096/#Comment_267096" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T10:09:57+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 10:09AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's better if you don't overthink that degree of success.

This is great.<br/>Also in general we have a great time establishing stakes.<br/><br/>For my part, I enjoy a lot establishing my stakes, but for now beside this, I sometime wish I had something like the player keys to play with (in the sense of gaining resources or something that I wish to use). <br/><br/>For the secondary characters, I am following the guidelines of the book and I use one ability about what they are, a single pool and some secrets. Spending their pool points and using their secrets to spend more pools points is fine, but it end there. <br/><br/>I was thinking about this after the game, and I think that maybe if my secondary characters had some more meaningful secrets who use the system to influence the fiction, like the Secret of Imposition (for imposing keys), it would be more rewarding for me to game this part of the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267118/#Comment_267118" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T11:32:42+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 11:32AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Key Elements are pretty fun. You create all sorts of prep and get to show it off to the players. They'll notice it when they're doing an elaborate Bang you prepared for how you give them extra XP for it. They get XP and you get to show off your prep.<br/><br/>It's also fun to put your creative passion into your secondary characters and their problems. Draw them in clean lines, exaggerating human traits for clarity and ease of play; what makes these guys good is not balanced humanity, but resolution: unlike the player characters your secondary characters already know who and what they are, and they always do the right thing by their lights. Make a character who believes in something you hope you'd have the courage to believe yourself, then see what the players make with the demands and actions of that character - perhaps they'll agree with him? Deck the secondaries with goals and means that have impact, don't sell them short to protect the player characters. Consider the most evil man in Near, Saul Lenoir: he's the sort of guy your NPCs should be, full of passion for life and easy, instinctive to play. He's basically Ra's Al-Ghul; I suggest you steal superheroes and villains and Disney movie stars for your NPCs until you learn to be naive enough to make them on your own.<br/><br/>Creating and using crunch is deeply enjoyable for me because I use the Crunch-Sight in looking at the fictional setting: when I realize that hey, obviously trolls are just humans without a Vigor spend cap or whatever, then that allows me to appreciate the thematic content of the fiction in a more powerful manner. When player characters take my crunch and run with it, that's fun, too.<br/><br/>However, the biggest fun comes from getting into the heads of the player characters and framing scenes where they're really at a loss as to what to do because the moral conundrum really is that fucking hard. There is also satisfaction in running a challenging scene full of passion and knowing in the back of your head that oh yeah, you poor bastard think that you rebuffed her advances, but <b>I</b> know that I already have the exactly correct follow-up scene I'll spring on you once you think that you're off the hook. There is joy in doing the dramatic coordination well: you know that you've had a good session when weighty issues were drawn in clear, firm strokes at the beginning, things vere elaborated upon in a life-like manner, and then at the end everything was resolved in a memorable fashion. At the end of a session I know that I've done my job well if I've sold a player with integrity-challenging life events for a character: if I talked a character into joining a cannibal tribe, getting the Key of the Cannibal and the Brain-eating Secret because it just made sense at the time, then that must have been a good session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267119/#Comment_267119" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T11:34:53+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 11:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Secret of Imposition is swank.

This is where I find most of my overall fun as a story guide in most story games.  <br/><br/>But I was thinking about something more "game mechanic", crunchy or maybe procedural.

I even suggest simplifying the non-player characters to the point of arbitrariness because I don't usually have that much time or attention for them. I'm more interested in making suggestions and meddling in how the players build their characters.<br/><br/>This is an interesting question, I don't quite have a ready-made answer because I've never felt that I need to have more mechanical engagement... would running more complex and long-term NPCs fit the bill here? Some systems in the game can be very complex, I could imagine that running an effective Three-Corner archmage would be an interesting challenge, for example.

(If there's no prior setting then the character gets more weight, as I don't have so much setting material to work with.) So if the play happens in Ammeni and the character has a Key of Greed or some such, then I'll try to think up a NPC and situation that is pertinent for the Key while being typical of Ammeni - or perhaps atypical in a way that makes the situation's follow-up interesting. Perhaps a slave trader wants the PC to help him capture some escaped slaves, for example. Once I have the slave trader and an initial interface against which the NPC might be relevant for a player character, I'll usually give the NPC some depth by adding virtues, flaws, whatever. Perhaps he's a loving father and a braggard, perhaps he's sleazy, perhaps he genuinely supports the institution of slavery (it's always fun when you get to defend outdated politics philosophically in rpgs)...<br/><br/>Characters in TSoY often travel geographically when a scenario shifts. In that situation I typically have choices: I know that the character is going to end up in a typical Joshland Gorenite town sooner or later, so who are the interesting people there going to be? I can pick people who just happen to be interesting, or I can pick people who are interesting <i>and</i> reflect the player character's Keys in some interesting ways, too. I will obviously go for the latter option, as one of my jobs as the Story Guide is to play towards the Keys. So if a character is greedy I might concoct something about a frozen chest of gold stuck in the permafrost ever since the Darkness, but now it's thawing and various people want to get their paws on it. Then I'll just invent some of those people and their motivations, ideally something that I'll find interesting myself as well. A hot witch cabal who decide to seduce the character to aid them in securing the McGuffin, a valorous chieftain who has ancestral claim to the treasure, some Vulflanders who are the only people who actually know the path to the treasure and so on.<br/><br/>It's really rather straightforward to think up characters, I don't usually worry about it that much. The most important thing probably is to get rid of any notion of uniqueness, originality or dynamism when it comes to NPCs. Those are what the player characters are, what you want of your NPCs is just clearly communicated, simple ideas. You want the player to realize that this girl is an innocent, sexy virgin (yes, I'm stuck in TSoY here, that game's all about bedding the wimin), this goblin is a sleazy addict, this chief is hot-headed but honorable... nothing complex, nothing nuanced: just simple characters and simple motivations. You're going to have many of these characters, you don't want to make them too difficult to care about and too difficult to play. The characters will gain in detail through using them, anyway, so in prep they just need to have a simple one-image identity and a motivation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267305/#Comment_267305" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T10:15:11+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 10:15AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, that's some fantastic advice! I think I intuitively do those same things when I play SS/TSoY, but seeing it written down is making a lot more sense. <br/><br/>As for mechanical crunch for the Story Guide, I think the game is mostly suited to someone who's really invested in the player characters and throwing adversity and interesting choices at them. As Story Guide, I concoct interesting situations and framing scenes for the player characters. The payoff, the reason why I play, is to see how they react and how it all turns out. When I play this game, I really have no idea, and so I'm just as excited to see how things will end as the players: it's the same joy as reading a good book: what will happen next?<br/><br/>That said, in the original text, I believe Clinton recommends writing up your major NPCs "full on", all the way up to the full character write-up, like a player character. You could certainly give your NPCs a full character sheet writeup, and use the XPs they earn to advance their Abilities, buy new Keys, and so on. It's balanced nicely, because NPCs will appear in fewer scenes than the PCs and therefore earn fewer XPs over time, preserving the heroic growth aspect of the Solar System.<br/><br/>My only concern with that approach would be that it would distract you from all the other fun, juicy stuff you need to do as a Story Guide (which Eero just described so well).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267308/#Comment_267308" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T10:29:13+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 10:29AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's my concern as well, Paul. At least I have my hands full trying to figure out what the next scene is going to be like without having to count xp for secondary characters. Solar System is totally a traditional game in that you don't have any sort of major mechanical structure limiting and supporting the Story Guide's work in dramatic coordination and challenging the characters. I like it that we have games like this as well - I get to do my thing full-on and pure - but it does mean that playing the game feels like juggling; all of my attention is on getting inside the characters, seeing in advance what the important issues are and trying to piece together the puzzle of what the next scene is going to look like. I only get to rest easily mid-way through a session when I figure out what's <i>really</i> going on in this story thematically - at that point I've got a flow, I know exactly which shit to throw at the player character in the next scene to have it make perfect, beautiful sense, and there's no way in hell the player can confuse me by making some unexpected choice when the logic of the story catches up to him as well. That's what is fun for the Story Guide in the game, it's a very traditional sort of fun. I get major kicks from the mechanics, but that's when the players engage them either by using them or having them used against them; this is doubly so when they're mechanics I've had a hand in devising myself, or mechanics where I appreciate their implications on the fiction. Still, all that happens through the player characters, I'm always up in their shit suggesting radical character development choices and challenging the players to think of who their characters are. Are you sure that your character doesn't have it in him to be a cannibal? That's some pretty leet powerz you could get by sampling some long pork, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267313/#Comment_267313" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T10:40:03+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 10:40AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I agree.

Who knows.<br/><br/>I would love to see you write some more about how you get "up in their shit" suggesting character development choices. I've heard you mention this several times, in various threads here and on the Forge. This is something I've never done in this game, however, and I'm not entirely sure how (although even just the "cannibal" example helps a lot!).<br/><br/>Would you share some thoughts on how to do this in play, maybe how often you do it, and how transparently you do it (do you mention a Secret and its full description, or just tempt the characters within the fiction)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267314/#Comment_267314" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T10:40:10+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 10:40AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2010 10:41AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noahtrammell</cite>o you set up all of your NPC's to directly off of or against the players' keys, or just create them as the fictional situation requires?</blockquote>\nNot sure what Eero said because tl;dr but here's what I do: Some Keys require outside intervention (Key of Compassion), so I make sure there are people and situations that will hit those hard. Sometimes that can be engineered using other PCs, but often I need to throw in some dude who needs Compassion. Other Keys (Key of the Orphan) do not need your help. <br/><br/>Other than that I sketch up big, meaty NPCs that <i>I want to see enter the fiction</i>, that I like, and if they can contribute to passive Key-hitting, awesome. If not, also awesome. I don't stat them up, relying on internal logic in the moment to give them scores when they first come up. <br/><br/>So in my rabbit-themed game I thought up a cat named Mother of Fear and a rabbit princess named Cloud Daughter. I made a map and a name list and a sketchy general premise and that was the extent of my prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267321/#Comment_267321" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T11:17:24+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 11:17AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason swings the way I do, essentially. He just says it more concisely.<br/><br/>Suggesting character development choices is one of the best parts of Story Guiding the game, because character development is the first pay-off in the game's reward system in the first place. You know that you've really done something when your character comes out of an adventure with a shamanic initiation, a magic sword, a talking monkey, a limp and an unquenchable thirst for human flesh. The SG is in the lucky position of being an impartial observer for how the other players are managing their characters; he can tell them how the characters look from the outside and what he thinks is their thing. He can also dress this discussion about character identity into some fiction; this is not a big difference if the players realize that we're still discussing character identity, we're just doing it through the fiction sometimes, sometimes not. So it's not a big difference if I let a nice NPC offer shamanic initiation to a character vs. just throwing it out there. I do the latter with jokish, extreme stuff I don't mean so seriously (but if the player wants that cannibalism Secret the antagonists are using, I sure am game), while the heavy stuff I want to suggest seriously I'll dress into fiction: I show characters who have the crunch, I show what it means to them, show them using it, I show them asking the player character to join them and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>The Story Guide can also create new crunch specifically to challenge players to make choices about who and what their characters are. I'm not very hot on the totally freeform procedure of crunch creation where players create their own crunch to accord with what they want their characters to do. I don't believe in game balance in a game like Solar System anyway, so even if the stuff players create is mechanically "balanced", it's going to be conveniently tailored to their characters anyway, and thus provides no challenge to them. It's better if the Story Guide creates crunch that says things about the setting and that the characters have to adapt to. For example, Three-Corner magic is a pain in the ass, frankly. However, if you want to be a mighty wizard, you have to work around the limitations and accept that some things are insanely difficult. It's not nearly so fun if the player can just write up a new Secret himself and have his character take it; that doesn't feel like mastering an objective system of magic anymore, if you know what I mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267324/#Comment_267324" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T11:23:16+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 11:23AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet, Eero!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
