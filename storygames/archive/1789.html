                    Okay, none of this namby-pamby "I like to make the players happy" or even the hard-core (but vague) "I like to torture the players and watch them squeal" nonsense.  If <i>anyone</i> jumps into this thread without at least peripherally addressing the following specific questions I will mock them mercilessly.  You have been warned.  Here are the questions:<br/>
<ul class="bbcode_list">
[li](1) What</ul>
<i>specifically</i> do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure?[/li][li](2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right?[/li][li](3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy?[/li][li](4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid?[/li]<br/>
<br/>
So here's one thing I like to do, in this format:<br/>
<ul class="bbcode_list">
[li](1) I like to find not merely</ul>
<b>a</b> threat against the characters but <b>the</b> threat, the perfect twist of the knife that makes the players gasp with fear and anticipation of pain, and inspires them to frenzied action.[/li][li](2) Not merely "A village is under attack by a werewolf" but "A child went out into the woods searching for mushrooms this morning, and she hasn't come back ... at nightfall the wolf will stalk the woods ... we must find her and protect her."[/li][li](3) Care about things.  Make passionate connections that make the character vulnerable.  Don't "turtle up" behind an impenetrable shield of apathy and detachment.[/li][li](4) Players passionately fight for the things they care about.  My attacking those things gives them the opportunity to fight for them.[/li]                </div>

                            tony, you have pretty much exactly encompassed what I like as a GM. I like to add a lot of weird mystery to it, and usually i build the whole villan around an image in my head. Im all visual, you have to get that "perfect twist of the knife" just by looking at the guy.                        </div>

                            I.<br><br> <b>  * (1) What specifically do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure? </b><br><br>Provoking a strong emotional, gut-level, in the moment response from players. Making them not just say, "Jesus my character would..." or on reflecting after the moment say, "that was really powerfull..." but making them want to cry, piss, scream, or laugh right there in the moment as the emotionality of the scene overwhelms them. <br/><br/> <b>   * (2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right? </b><br/><br/>When every player at the table is in uncrontrollable tears, laughter, or trembling with rage. (Fear is harder to do, and unfortunatly I rarely get it quite right.)<br/><br/>Almost right is (unlike the NPC issue listed below) when the players only talk about it excitedly afterwards without having actually gotten gut-kicked in the moment.  <br/><br/><b>    * (3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy? </b><br/><br/>Being open to it, giving me lots of character and story fuel that is based off issues they really care about, and being willing to be emotionally vulnerable are all pretty much neccesary. Kickers that get into issues people are dealing with in real life are a big thing. But perhaps biggest of all is the willingness and ability to stop thinking about what is happening, to not analyze and build, but to feel it in the moment and just go with it. <br/><br/> <b>   * (4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid?</b><br/><br/>Given the emotional agendas of most of the people I play with, this would probably count as their primary reason for playing. If I can't make them feel it, in their guts and in their tear ducts rather than just in the aesthetic appreciation of their minds, they probably wouldn't keep coming back to the table. They want to feel it, and so making them feel it is, I'd guess, pretty good support for what they're at the table for. <br/><br/>II.<br/><br/> <b> * (1) What specifically do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure?</b><br/><br/>Playing the hardcorest of hardcore NPCs, finding characters that get under the players skin and drive them mad with fear, love, hate, lust, or rage. <br/><br/> <b>   * (2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right?</b><br/><br/>When my players, after game, are talking about their reactions to an NPC. Not the character's reactions, mind you, but their personal visceral reactions to a character in the game. If I can only get them to react in game that's almost right, but not all the way there. <br/><br/>This conversation would let me know I did it right: <br/><br/>Player1: Oh my God I so want to fuck Rama. <br/>Player2: But I thought your character hated Rama?<br/>Player1: Oh she does -- she doesn't want to fuck Rama, I do. <br/><br/>Fuck, obviously, could be replaced with other words such as "kill, marry, knife to death, make president" and be just as good.<br/><br/> <b>   * (3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy? </b><br/><br/>Getting in there and mixing it up with the NPCs. No NPC ever gets to the level of FUCKYOUness that I most desire unless the PCs are pushing the NPC as hard as s/he is pushing them. Passionate commitment to messing up existing relationships is needed. <br/><br/>Also, PCs making up NPCs that they care about and then handing them over to me with wide and innocent eyes is vastly helpful. It's like saying "here, not only do I want you to fill my world with pain, but I'll give you a tool to do it with." <br/><br/> <b>   * (4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid? </b><br/><br/>Many of my players are setting, story, and/or character socket players, and to all of them having big, powerful NPCs to interact with is vastly important. There is a real way in which the settings of our games are defined by NPCs with everything else in the world taking a very distant second seat. <br/><br/>I find it funny that I and at least two of my players, when we were young, would color in the characters in pictures in our coloring books but wouldn't color in the backgrounds. <br/><br/>III.<br/><br/> <b> * (1) What specifically do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure?</b><br/><br/>Giving good descriptions, visions into other places and times that are at once solid and vicarious and also poetically delivered. <br/><br/> <b>* (2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right?</b><br/><br/>When I describe the heat, the dust, and the starving cows of the town the PCs all live in and when I turn narration over to one of them the immediate reaction is to pick up and talk about how the ribs are showing through their horse's skin because everyone is doing badly, and then the next talks about the lean and hungry look in her eyes and the eyes of her warrior band as they contemplate a raid on the next town over. <br/><br/>Almost right is when everyone says, "Wow, that was amazing" and then has their narration not fully link up with what I just set out. Either because I didn't hook it quite right, or because I got the wrong level of detail (too much or too little). <br/><br/>Wrong is, obviously, when everyone is rolling their eyes waiting for me to be done. <br/><br/> <b>  * (3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy?</b><br/><br/>Running commentary, strong use of their own color from narration to character setup, giving me tangible things to describe and react to when we set up the game and the characters, and letting me know honestly when I've gotten carried away with my own verbal prowess. <br/><br/> <b>   * (4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid? </b><br/><br/>Once again, those with a setting socket really dig being able to feel the world, and those with a character socket like having things to react to and build off of. This one is me trying to learn to color in the background, and not just the characters so that together they build a whole picture.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            (1) What<em>specifically</em>do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure?<br/><br/>My greatest joy is to throw the characters into situations so intense (not necessarily dangerous, not even necessarily inescapable, but requiring the players to make choices between things they care about) that what the players do in response surprises themselves and me.<br/><br/>This is actually the same thing I like doing as a player: surprising everyone, including myself, by how my character changes under pressure.<br/><br/><br/>(2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right?<br/><br/>Almost right:<br/>"... and afterwards the two of them come back to the camp together, and they're not holding hands or anything, but..."<br/>"I'm dropping my Key of Unrequited Love for him."<br/>"Whaaat?"<br/>"I give up. I can't win this one. I'm changing it into Key of Fraternity. Let 'em be happy together."<br/>"Okay, so that subplot is DONE. Cool."<br/><br/>Right:<br/>"... and, without even looking at you -- he never looks at you -- your father the baron orders you to..."<br/>"I say 'no.' I'm dropping that Key about being submissive to male authority, right now."<br/>"Whaaat?"<br/>"I'm defying him."<br/>"Okay, so now things are gonna get really complicated...."<br/><br/><br/>(3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy?<br/><br/>Play it loose.<br/>That includes not "turtling" and being willing to risk caring about things they can't control and might lose, but it's more than that: It means treating the "character" in "my character" as something less than sacrosanct, as a tool rather than a truth, and treating the "my" as "mine to take care of, but all of ours to mold."<br/><br/><br/>(4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid?<br/><br/>They unleash their creativity, not in the methodical, step-by-step, self-editing manner of character generation or worldbuilding or writing, but in the wildfire emotional logic of a dream -- and in the process they make statements about who they are as human beings.                        </div>

                            Kind of reposting, but<br/><br/><b>(1) What specifically do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure?</b><br/> Sense a direction that the player is interested in heading, and take them further down that road than they maybe would have dared.<br/><br/><b>(2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right?</b><br/>A game about adult pcs, who all shared a traumatic but ill-remembered childhood in a secluded cultish community, and had met up to try and uncover that past. Their relationships to each other weren't codified but free to emerge in play. I saw that one player was playing his guy as very distant and uncomfortable with the whole thing. In a dream/flashback sequence I established that young teens in the community were recruited as 'Altar Boys' to keep the kids in line and give out punishments - which was exactly what that guys character had been called in the past. This took his remoteness and stretched it into complicity - meaty stuff to play with. <br/><br/>Almost right would be erring to the side of giving him as much but not more than he was expecting - perhaps his dad was a rival to the parents of the other pcs, giving deep-seated divisions without any causal involvement. Going the other way, well beyond the degree he was pointing at, by painting him as an out-and-out villain - almost certainly not almost right; quite possibly deprotagonisation.<br/><br/><b>(3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy?</b><br/>Players have to be open, but they don't need to put their finger on a specific want. If their IC portrayal is trying to get at something, or OOC they're giving some relevant table talk, those are the seeds I need - the whole point is to take ill-formed ideas and cohere them. The player also needs to be resilient enough to accept a little risk - whether adding to their backstory, or some in-game temptation, this technique is all about shaping a character, pushing it out of a comfort zone and discovering limits.<br/><br/><b>(4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid?</b><br/> Players care about characters that have been defined by in-game events; sometimes they have a concept of what they want (troubled, divided loyalties; or, a hot-head who makes a big mistake) but it's not always easy to put this into practise in-game. My job is to take their intent and make it real, and tie it all in with the in-game reality, and just as importantly, the arcs of other characters.                        </div>

                            (1) I like making the players reevaluate the situation, suddenly realizing how big or how small a particular element really is in the world.<br/><br/>(2) I can tell when I do this right, because everyone's expressions change. "They're sending HOW MANY third-circle demons after us? And they're here NOW? SHIT!" I can tell when it's been done badly because they get upset at the lack of clues that things were either too big or too small.<br/><br/>(3) Players who think long-term are my best friends, especially if their characters do as well. People who think strategically are actually <i>capable</i> of reevaluation. People who just see "a fight" in front of them don't bother, which makes it much harder.<br/><br/>(4) Hmm. Hopefully this helps them have memorable stories to tell. I couldn't really say, other than that.                        </div>

                            Version One<br/><br/>(1) What specifically do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure?<br/><br/>I enjoy surprising myself, drawing on a number of different, sometimes nearly random collection of elements (NPC's, places, plot seeds) and composing something big, baroque, interconnected.  I don't want to know where it is all going, but I love having a whole pile of shit to take me there.  It's bricolage.  I love building tons of context and then finding all the connections that can arise in that context.<br/><br/>(2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right?<br/><br/>When it is done right, the seemingly random bits just fit together so that they just seem natural, as if they had been carefully planned.  The odd juxtapositions don't seem forced, they seem part of the context.  Each element is a shining gem that illuminates the others, each giving the other more weight.<br/><br/>Almost right and the elements don't sparkle.  The connections seem very crafted, artificial.  They are still appealing, they just don't feedoff each other.<br/><br/>(3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy?<br/><br/>They can talk about their ideas of what is going on, make hypotheses, argue with each other a little about them, citing evidence from play.  They can actively explore and interact with the world, making me think about what should happen if they do x, talk to x, try to kill x.<br/><br/>(4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid?<br/><br/>I support exploration in a big way and reward players with clever ideas of how things might be by riffing on just those ideas.  I support active players, because the more they interact with me, the more they contribute, the more objects I have to draw upon in composing the setting.<br/><br/>Version Two<br/><br/>(1) What specifically do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure?<br/><br/>Creating NPC's that have a life inside the world, who have strong personalities and can change dramatically over the course of a game. <br/><br/>(2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right?<br/><br/>When it is done right, the NPC comes alive, becomes an active contributor to the story, someone that the players care about (for good or ill) and want to interact with, want to help shape.<br/><br/>When it is done almost right, the NPC is interesting, enjoyed by the players, but not someone that they really want to invest a lot of game time exploring.  The NPC's transformation happens, but only indirectly impacts the players experience of the game.  The players get that the character is cool, but not that they are capable of change and growth.<br/><br/>(3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy?<br/><br/>Interacting with NPC's, talking to them, appreciating their world, their motivations, treating them as something that can be persuaded, intimidated, and otherwise dealt with as a person.  Treating NPC's as more than mooks or information dispensers is a big help.<br/><br/>(4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid?<br/><br/>I support players taking an interest in the lives of the NPC's around them, I support them taking emotional interest in their lives.  I support players taking game time to check up on NPC's they like, on spending resources to discover more about them, or help them.<br/><br/>This has ramifications for the first thing that interests me, since I tend to get 'clumps' of NPC's with chunks of setting built around them, about which players are very invested.  Around which I can compose core elements--the more they can tie those NPC's they care about to the setting, the more they get back in terms of story.                        </div>

<p>When I'm in a GMish role and I play it as a player and equal, that makes me happy. I don't like being the eminence gris of a group of players that make no real choices, and I don't like running opposition with like no real constraints other than my good sportsmanship. I don't like being robbed of a strong character to portray.</p>
<p>Bleh. It is hard to talk about this in AP because I'm so resistant to GMing lately, but systemically, Agon really makes me as Antagonist feel equal and included. Back in the day I ran D&amp;D and like really felt like an oppressor. Even when I was swaying to the players' needs and interests and providing appropriate opposition, it felt like a lie, because within the rules I could just decide to stop. It was horrible.</p>
<p>I guess there's no way for players to help me do this, except perhaps to rein me in when I am stepping out of bounds.</p>
<p>So, like, this is all intended to support the creative community of all the players present. I feel that I contribute better when I'm not being, uh, destructive basically.</p>

                            (1) What specifically do you do as a GM that gives you satisfaction and pleasure?<br/><br/>I like to introduce twists or surprises that elicit phrases like, "Aw... shit!" or "Oh, hell no!" from my players.<br/> <br/>(2) What is a concrete example of doing this right, and how does that compare with doing it almost-right?<br/><br/>In a D&amp;D game, my players had be actively and intensely involved with a rivalry (a rather violent and emotional rivalry) with a group of NPCs.  Specifically they really hated the other group's leader.  At one point, it became apparent that one of the PC's love interest and an NPC in the player's party was the daughter of the hated leader of the rival group.  This got the response... "Aw, shit!  I like her!"  I got so much mileage out of that one little plot twist.<br/><br/>(3) What can players do that supports and aids you in doing this thing that you enjoy?<br/><br/>They can engage with the setting and the NPCs.  They can show me what stuff they really care about through play and through kibitzing with their fellow players.  They can come out of their shells trusting that I am goint to screw with them but I'm not going to screw them over.<br/><br/>(4) Is there something that the players do that you, by doing this thing you like, support and aid?<br/><br/>You know... I've never asked myself this before and that's a little sad.  I'm not sure what the answer is and I really should know.  I'll have to think about this some more.                        </div>
