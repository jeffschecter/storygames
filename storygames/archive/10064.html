Due to [CLAStaticSIFIED] spiders were on agents Killer and Shields almost immediately. Pre-insertion rise of [CLASSIFIED] brings cause for serious concern. Control was contacted, and authenticity reports confirmed contact style, verifying a lack of intermediary interference/deception. Agents then took \u201cNew Castle Subdivision Rail\u201d to reach \u201cMillennium Stadium\u201d [Blue//Black Area]. Met and recursively emblazoned \u201cpersonality\u201d \u201cTriona Niphonaill\u201d. Headed to stadium proper, Agent Killer utilized \u201cSafe House\u201d [Actually [CLASSIFIED]while agent Shields followed the \u201cpersonality\u201d and encountered Senior Agent Baxter [Subject of internal investigation]. Agent Warner then proceeded to kill personality \u201c[CLASIFIED]\u201d and hijack control systems for the stadium. Team leader Agent Mason came into contact with control several times- promotion to deep blue and modification of lacuna devices on team <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23601&amp;Mode=like">#601</a> seems to have been successful on cutting out false [CLASSIFIED]. Personalities \u201cTeam Leviathan\u201d became HOSTILE when exposed to [CLASSIFIED], proceeded to manage to intercept the [CLASSIFIED] process and obtain requisitioned weapon from Agent Mason. Recurring Personality \u201cTriona Niphonaill\u201d was then shot, but not before [CLASSIFIED] was obtained, recorded and stored in Miner\u2019s safe-house by Agent Shields. Agent Baxter suffered clear [CLASSIFIED] and was taken by Agents Killer and Shields out of area while Agents Mason and Warner fought the HP, described as \u201cfighting for time, not victory\u201d, and with several instances of [\u0394]. The [\u0394] seemed in line with other instances of [\u0394], such as one\u2019s experienced previously in border zones, and information relating to {\u03b1} [The Conflict]. Team <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23601&amp;Mode=like">#601</a> then proceeded to follow Agent Baxter to a black level area, despite repeated warnings against this from control- at least one [CLASSIFIED] was also present. <b>Further information is from post-mission data.</b> Agent Killer entered cardiac arrest, but was revived and later made a full recovery. Agent Warner suffered from severe [CLASSIFIED], and has since been granted permanent leave from the company. Agent Shields was awarded extra commendations for excellent service to the company. Agents Warner and Mason were de-briefed by Agent [CLASSIFIED] but no meaningful information was gained. Agents Mason and Warner were found with a [CLASSpiderIFIED] crawling on them after ejecting. Once again the spiders spread their web to the white. [CLASSIFIED] [CLASSIFIED] [CLASSIFIED] [CLASSIFIED]. <br/><br/>A report of a mission conducted by mystery agent team <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23601&amp;Mode=like">#601</a> <br/><br/>Mystery Agents: Team #601: [Agent Mason [Leader], Agent Shields, Agent Killer, Agent Warner], Vice-Director Forester [mission overseer]<br/>Mission Eighteen: HP- Mohan Krishna//Special [Black] Agent Sexton<br/><br/>The agents entered blue city in the deep blue border zone \u201cKahntah Aerodome\u201d. Met and recursively emblazoned personality \u201cRen\xe9 Menil\u201d. Agents were given \u201cControl Dat\u03b1\u201d [Conflict info], originally given by [CLASnyderSIIFED This contact described mission details, as well as a warning related to [CLASSIFIED] in the form of Luke 17:32, and finally, an earlier message from control to the now rogue agent Miner. The plane began filling with AB5 Toxin, although Agent Warner escaped using a technique. Static began building rapidly from this point on, leveling out after a while, then spiking up again later. Agent Killer [in cover identity \u201cWallace Williamson\u201d] and Agent Mason proceeded to the Dinorwic rail, one of the few [None] deep blue rail lines with personality \u201cRen\xe9 Menil\u201d. They then contacted Mythography \u0394 for [CLASSIFIED] information, and were denied- Agent Day of Mythography \u0394 was convinced that this communication was false based on \u0394\u2019s [CLASSIFIED] interceptor, but [CLASSIFIED]. Meanwhile, Mythography \u0394\u2019s attempts to destroy the [STATIC] driven cars after Agents Warner and Shields were unsuccessful, though the cars were dissuaded from pursuit [albeit not destroyed] anyways by the agents. The agents then went to another safe house of Agent Miner\u2019s [Information regarding this was obscured by static] another restricted area was accessed- more spidermen films such as the one noted by agents in mission thirteen. Agents proceeded into the \u201cToromont Industrial Site\u201d and spotted HP \u201cMohan Krishna\u201d. Also spotted were agents Spencer and Singer, on mission with Agents Chandler and Snyder- the mission that led to Snyder\u2019s retirement. Agent Singer gave the agents the \u201c<a href="http://www.dreadgazebo.com/lacuna/" rel="nofollow">memo</a>\u201d he had possession of, but they were unable to find its true [CLASSFIED]. Agents came into contact with hoverflies, were infected by AB5 toxin. Agent Snyder came into contact with and took down Black Agent Sexton as per orders. Agent Chandler was ejected too late and died on the slab from the toxin and earlier wounds. Agent Snyder then ejected agents Spencer and Singer, implemented a control block to cease all further communications from his lacuna device and that of Agents Warner and Mason, and proceeded to try and assist agent Shields, but was forcefully ejected and retired. A buggy was shot into the roof and exploded, wounding Krishna, at which point static totally overtook the line, and all remaining agents were forcefully ejected. The AB5 toxin remains in the area released- another team will be sent to deal with its spread. Team <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23601&amp;Mode=like">#601</a> will then be fully briefed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223305/#Comment_223305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T15:23:19+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  3:23PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanically speaking, the game went well. The first mission had the agents all temporarily promoted to deep blue clearance, and thanks to me giving out some black and white commendations (in my game, commendations are differently colored and represented by poker chips, ones besides the blue (normal) ones count as five and are earned by "helping control/mythography" (white) or [CLASSIFIED] for black. Since those counted as five, by the second mission everyone was permanently promoted to deep blue. This meant lots of personal static, which was good for ratcheting up the tension. Also, people had lots of techniques now, which made for more roleplaying as disguised or cover identity using people would go for stealth approaches to things. Heart rates went up fast, as did static, with static of twenty one being reached in both missions. In the first mission, one player had to roll emergency ejection because his heart rate went up after an interrogation by several spidermen (not mentioned in control's report, above, because they didn't know about it). <br/><br/>Anyways, the group was so excited that half of them want to buy the game, so that's cool. Also, we're playing again and once again I made up like five or six pages of enigmatic fliers and handouts to give to the players (which I did this time as well). It's fun to combine weird fonts, hidden messages, bizarre cryptic language, and creepy song lyrics and then hand them to the players and see what they interpret as the meaning...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
